Those with compulsive skin picking have issues with picking, rubbing, digging, or scratching the skin. These activities are usually to get rid of unwanted blemishes or marks on the skin. These compulsions also tend to leave abrasions and irritation on the skin. This can lead to infection or other issues in healing. These acts tend to be prevalent in times of anxiety, boredom, or stress.[11] Reviews recommend behavioral interventions such as habit reversal training[12] and decoupling.[13]
Hoarding is characterized by excessive saving of possessions and having problems when throwing these belongings away. Major features of hoarding include not being able to use the capacity of one's living quarters efficiently, having difficulty moving throughout the home due to the massive amount of possessions, as well as having blocked exits that can pose a danger to the hoarder and their family and guests. Items that are typically saved by hoarders include clothes, newspapers, containers, junk mail, books, and craft items. Hoarders believe these items will be useful in the future or they are too sentimental to throw them away. Other reasons include fear of losing important documents and information and object characteristics.[7]

Compulsive checking can include compulsively checking items such as locks, switches, and appliances. This type of compulsion usually deals with checking whether harm to oneself or others is possible. Usually, most checking behaviors occur due to wanting to keep others and the individual safe;[14] this condition is also known as obsessive-compulsive behavior.

Trichotillomania is classified as a compulsive picking of hair of the body. It can be from any place on the body that has hair. This picking results in bald spots. Most people who have mild trichotillomania can overcome it via concentration and more self-awareness.[10]

Compulsive washing is usually found in individuals that have a fear of contamination. People that have compulsive hand washing behaviors wash their hands repeatedly throughout the day. These hand washings can be ritualized and follow a pattern. People that have problems with compulsive hand washing tend to have problems with chapped or red hands due to the excessive amount of washing done each day.[16]

Compulsive behavior (or compulsion) is defined as performing an action persistently and repetitively. Compulsive behaviors could be an attempt to make obsessions go away.[1] The act is usually a small, restricted and repetitive behavior, yet not disturbing in a pathological way.[citation needed] Compulsive behaviors are a need to reduce apprehension caused by internal feelings a person wants to abstain from or control.[2] A major cause of compulsive behavior is said to be obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).[1][3] "The main idea of compulsive behavior is that the likely excessive activity is not connected to the purpose to which it appears directed."[citation needed] There are many different types of compulsive behaviors including shopping, hoarding, eating, gambling, trichotillomania and picking skin, itching, checking, counting, washing, sex, and more. Also, there are cultural examples of compulsive behavior.

People with compulsive counting tend to have a specific number that is of importance in the situation they are in. When a number is considered significant, the individual has a desire to do the behavior such as wiping one's face off the number of times that is significant. Compulsive counting can include instances of counting things such as steps, items, behaviors, and mental counting.[15]

Compulsive repeating is characterized by doing the same activity multiple times over. These activities can include re-reading a part of a book multiple times, re-writing something multiple times, repeating routine activities, or saying the same phrase over and over.[17]

This type of compulsive behavior is characterized by feelings, thoughts, and behaviors about anything related to sex. These thoughts have to be pervasive and cause problems in health, occupation, socialization, or other parts of life. These feelings, thoughts, and behaviors can include normal sexual behaviors or behaviors that are considered illegal and/or morally and culturally unacceptable. This disorder is also known as hypersexuality, hypersexual disorder, nymphomania or sexual addiction.[18] Controversially, some scientists have characterized compulsive sexual behavior as sexual addiction, although no such condition is recognized by mainstream medical diagnostic manuals.[citation needed]

About 50 million people in the world today appear to have some type of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Affected people are often more secretive than other people with psychological problems, so the more serious psychological disorders are diagnosed more often. Many who exhibit compulsive behavior will claim it is not a problem and may endure the condition for years before seeking help.[5]

While not all compulsive behaviors are addictions, some such as compulsive sexual behavior have been identified as behavioral addictions.
Compulsive overeating is the inability to control one's amount of nutritional intake, resulting in excessive weight gain. This overeating is usually a coping mechanism to deal with issues in the individual's life such as stress. Most compulsive over-eaters know that what they are doing is not good for them. The compulsive behavior usually develops in early childhood. People who struggle with compulsive eating usually do not have proper coping skills to deal with the emotional issues that cause their overindulgence in food. They indulge in binges, periods of varying duration in which they eat and/or drink without pause until the compulsion passes or they are unable to consume any more. These binges are usually accompanied by feelings of guilt and shame about using food to avoid emotional stress. This compulsive behavior can have deadly side effects including, but not limited to, binge eating, depression, withdrawal from activities due to weight, and spontaneous dieting. Though this is a very serious compulsive behavior, getting treatment and a proper diet plan can help individuals overcome these behaviors.[8]In Eating disorders (like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa) person is preoccupied with weight, body and caloric intake. In this, there are certain behaviors, which are maladaptive and persistent and could be viewed as compulsive behaviors. For instance, restricting what the person eats, vomiting, abusing laxatives and over-exercising.

Addiction and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) feature compulsive behavior as core features. Addiction is simply a compulsion toward a rewarding stimulus. Whereas in OCD, a compulsion is a facet of the disorder.[4] The most common compulsions for people with OCD are washing and checking.[3]
Compulsive shopping is characterized by excessive shopping that causes impairment in a person's life such as financial issues or not being able to commit to a family. The prevalence rate for this compulsive behavior is 5.8% worldwide, and a majority of the people who are affected by this type of behavior are women (approximately 80%). There is no proven treatment for this type of compulsive behavior.[6]

Binge eating may be considered as compulsive behaviors. In this, a person may realize that he is overeating and regret it after some time.
Compulsive talking goes beyond the bounds of what is considered to be a socially acceptable amount of talking.[19] The two main factors in determining if someone is a compulsive talker are talking in a continuous manner, only stopping when the other person starts talking, and others perceiving their talking as a problem. Personality traits that have been positively linked to this compulsion include assertiveness, willingness to communicate, self-perceived communication competence, and neuroticism.[20] Studies have shown that most people who are talkaholics are aware of the amount of talking they do, are unable to stop, and do not see it as a problem.[21]

Compulsive gambling is characterized by having the desire to gamble and not being able to resist said desires. The gambling leads to serious personal and social issues in the individual's life. This compulsive behavior usually begins in early adolescence for men and between the ages of 20-40 for women. People who have issues controlling compulsions to gamble usually have an even harder time resisting when they are having a stressful time in life. People who gamble compulsively tend to run into issues with family members, the law, and the places and people they gamble with. The majority of the issues with this compulsive behavior are due to lack of money to continue gambling or pay off debt from previous gambling. Compulsive gambling can be helped with various forms of treatment such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Self-help or Twelve-step programs, and potentially medication.[9]

Learn to organize possessions in order to decide what to discard.
Get a better insight into the hoarding severity and style.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a commonly implemented therapeutic intervention for compulsive hoarding. As part of cognitive behavior therapy, the therapist may help the patient to:
Although excessive acquiring is not a diagnostic criterion of hoarding, at least two-thirds of individuals with hoarding disorder excessively acquire possessions.[19] Having a more anxiously attached interpersonal style is associated with more compulsive buying and greater acquisition of free items and these relationships are mediated by stronger distress intolerance and greater anthropomorphism.[20] Anthropomorphism has been shown to increase both the sentimental value and perceived utility of items.[21] These findings indicate that individuals may over-value their possessions to compensate for thwarted interpersonal needs. Feeling alone and/or disconnected from others may impair people's ability to tolerate distress and increase people's tendencies to see human-like qualities in objects. The humanness of items may increase their perceived value and individuals may acquire these valued objects to alleviate distress. Individuals with hoarding problems have been shown to have greater interpersonal problems than individuals who only excessively acquire possessions,[22] which provides some support for the assumption that individuals with hoarding problems may have a stronger motivation to hang onto possessions for support. As possessions cannot provide support in the way humans can and because saving excessively can frustrate other people due to its impact on their quality of life, individuals with hoarding disorder may be caught in a feedback loop. They may save to alleviate distress, but this saving may cause distress, which may lead them to keep saving to alleviate the distress.
Harm reduction rather than symptom reduction. Also borrowed from addiction therapy. The goal is to decrease the harmful implications of the behavior, rather than the hoarding behaviors.[27]

Mental health professionals frequently express frustration regarding hoarding cases, mostly due to premature termination and poor response to treatment. Patients are frequently described as indecisive, procrastinators, recalcitrant, and as having low or no motivation,[28][34] which can explain why many interventions fail to accomplish significant results. To overcome this obstacle, some clinicians recommend accompanying individual therapy with home visits to help the clinician:

Prevalence rates are estimated at 2% to 5% in adults,[8] though the condition typically manifests in childhood with symptoms worsening in advanced age, at which point collected items have grown excessive and family members who would otherwise help to maintain and control the levels of clutter have either died or moved away.[9]

"Prevalence and correlates of hoarding behavior in a community-based sample"
A second key part of this study was to determine if stressful life events are linked to the onset of hoarding symptoms. Similar to self-harming, traumatized persons may create a problem for themselves in order to avoid their real anxiety or trauma. Facing their real issues may be too difficult for them, so they create an artificial problem (in their case, hoarding) and prefer to battle with it rather than determine, face, or do something about their real anxieties. Hoarders may suppress their psychological pain by hoarding. The study shows that adults who hoard report a greater lifetime incidence of having possessions taken by force, forced sexual activity as either an adult or a child, including forced sexual intercourse, and being physically handled roughly during childhood, thus proving traumatic events are positively correlated with the severity of hoarding. For each five years of life the participant would rate from 1 to 4, 4 being the most severe, the severity of their hoarding symptoms. Of the participants, 548 reported a chronic course, 159 an increasing course and 39 people, a decreasing course of illness. The incidents of increased hoarding behavior were usually correlated to five categories of stressful life events.[18]

Individuals with hoarding behaviors are often described as having low motivation and poor compliance levels, and as being indecisive and procrastinators, which may frequently lead to premature termination (i.e., dropout) or low response to treatment.[28][32] Therefore, it was suggested that future treatment approaches, and pharmacotherapy in particular, be directed to address the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairments demonstrated by individuals with hoarding symptoms.[33]

In a 2010 study using data from self-reports of hoarding behavior from 751 participants, it was found most reported the onset of their hoarding symptoms between the ages of 11 and 20 years old, with 70% reporting the behaviors before the age of 21. Fewer than 4% of people reported the onset of their symptoms after the age of 40. The data showed that compulsive hoarding usually begins early, but often does not become more prominent until after age 40. Different reasons have been given for this, such as the effects of family presence earlier in life and limits on hoarding imposed by housing situation and lifestyle. The understanding of early onset hoarding behavior may help in the future to better distinguish hoarding behavior from "normal" childhood collecting behaviors.[18]

Compulsive hoarding, also known as hoarding disorder, Plyushkin's disorder, is a mental disorder characterised by accumulation of possessions due to excessive acquisition of or difficulty discarding them, regardless of their actual value, leading to clinically significant distress or impairmentin personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Excessive acquisition is characterized by repetitive urges or behaviours related to amassing or buying items. Difficulty discarding possessions is characterized by a perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them. Accumulation of possessions results in living spaces becoming cluttered to the point that their use or safety is compromised.[7] It is recognised by the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5).

Collecting and hoarding may seem similar, but there are distinct characteristics that set the behaviors apart. Collecting is a hobby often involving the targeted search and acquisition of specific items that form—at least from the perspective of the collector—a greater appreciation, deeper understanding, or increased synergistic value when combined with other similar items. Hoarding, by contrast, typically appears haphazard and involves the overall acquiring of common items that would not be especially meaningful to the person who is gathering such items in large quantities.[13][14] People who hoard commonly keep items that hold little to no true meaning or value to most others, unlike some collectors, whose items may be of great value to select people. Most hoarders are disorganized, and their living areas are crowded and in disarray. Most collectors can afford to store their items systematically or to have enough room to display their collections.[15] Age, mental state, or finances have caused some collectors to fall into a hoarding state.[16]

Group psychotherapy reduces social isolation and social anxiety and is cost-effective compared to one-on-one intervention.[28] Group CBT tends to have similar outcomes to individual therapy.[29] Although group treatment often does not include home sessions, experimental research suggests that treatment outcomes may be improved if home sessions are included. Individuals have been shown to discard more possessions when in a cluttered environment compared to a tidy environment.[30] Indeed, a meta-analysis found that a greater number of home sessions improves CBT outcomes.[31]

This modality of treatment usually involves exposure and response prevention to situations that cause anxiety and cognitive restructuring of beliefs related to hoarding. Furthermore, research has also shown that certain CBT protocols have been more effective in treatment than others. CBT programs that specifically address the motivation of the affected person, organization, acquiring new clutter, and removing current clutter from the home have shown promising results. This type of treatment typically involves in-home work with a therapist combined with between-session homework, the completion of which is associated with better treatment outcomes.[24] Research on internet-based CBT treatments for the disorder (where participants have access to educational resources, cognitive strategies, and chat groups) has also shown promising results both in terms of short- and long-term recovery.[25]

A UK charity called HoardingUK, has found that people have very different ideas about what it means to have a cluttered home. For some, a small pile of things in the corner of an otherwise well-ordered room constitutes serious clutter. For others, only when the narrow pathways make it hard to get through a room does the clutter register. To ensure an accurate sense of a clutter problem, they created the Clutter Image Rating, a series of pictures of rooms in various stages of clutter – from completely clutter-free to very severely cluttered designed to encourage people to get support.[17]

People with hoarding disorder commonly live with other complex and/or psychological disorders such as depression,[10] anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[11] Other factors often associated with hoarding include alcohol dependence and paranoid, schizotypal and avoidance traits.[12]
Motivational interviewing originated in addiction therapy. This method is significantly helpful when used in hoarding cases in which insight is poor and ambivalence to change is marked.[26][27]
Only 5% of people with hoarding behaviours receive help (Singh, 2012) and the interventions they do receive focus on clearing items, not treating the disorder.

In Alex Delaware, Kellerman draws a hero who appears to be "a levelheaded, appealingly thoughtful guy".[3] Kellerman also provides Alex Delaware with a side-kick, LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, as is customary in the mystery genre. It is also revealed that his mother was a manic-depressive and his father a raging, physically abusive alcoholic. Kellerman also adds a girlfriend, Robin Castagna, and a French bulldog, which serve to emphasize Delaware's empathetic nature. In several novels, Alex and Robin break up. Alex begins dating Dr. Alison Gwynn, also a Ph.D., clinical psychologist, while Robin dates Tim Plachette, a voice coach.[4]

Alex is called in to assist with a murder of a faceless victim, with whom the owners of the home the body is found in, the Corvins, are unfamiliar. The investigation uncovers that, aside from the Corvins, the rest of the community is particularly secretive and uncooperative, and unwilling to divulge information to Alex and the LAPD to solve this violent crime. Alex navigates the secrets of this well-to-do enclave of Los Angeles, exploring everything from the greed to shady sexual and deadly secrets, to get to the bottom of this case.

Kellerman introduces Alex Delaware, Ph.D., in When the Bough Breaks. Kellerman characterizes Delaware as a successful (albeit retired) child psychologist suffering from burn-out after working on a case of systematic child molestation that culminates when the offender commits suicide in Delaware's office. Detective Milo Sturgis urges Delaware to come out of retirement and interview a seven-year-old child who may have witnessed a crime. Sturgis appoints Delaware as a "special consultant" to the Los Angeles Police Department.[8] Kellerman's timing in this novel coincided with news stories about child abuse in child care facilities.[9] The book was adapted as a 1986 film starring Ted Danson as Alex and Richard Masur as Milo.
In Killer, Dr. Delaware becomes briefly embroiled in a bizarre custody battle between two sisters; one, a sophisticated, successful doctor, the other, an itinerant groupie. When the former is found murdered and the other disappears with her child, gay LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis will need Dr. Delaware's insight, expertise - and instinct - to solve the case.
In The Clinic Kellerman presents Delaware with a cold case of murder, and the victim was a "pop psychology" author named Hope Devane.When Sturgis gets the cold case he calls in pal and psychologist Delaware hoping to find insights to Devane's life. The two uncover an execution style crime, her compartmentalized life, and her link to a second murder victim. However, Delaware's turns his forensic psychology skills toward her childhood where he finds answers, danger, and a killer.[18]
The first novel in the series, When the Bough Breaks was adapted as a 1986 film starring Ted Danson as Alex Delaware and Richard Masur as Milo Sturgis.

In Over the Edge, Kellerman presents Delaware's back story as a researcher in the study "Project 160", that involved the treatment of gifted children. As the novel opens, Delaware receives a phone call from Jamey Cadmus, who had been involved in the research project. Jamey has beenarrested and accused of being a serial killer who preys on young male prostitutes. Delaware is hired by Cadmus' attorney to investigate. In this novel, Kellerman examines preconceived notions about homosexuality; and he examines how others perceive Delaware because of his friendship with Milo Sturgis. In the course of the investigation, Delaware eliminates the obvious clues and discovers a greater evil than he imagined.[11] Additionally, Kellerman investigates psychological problems resulting from childhood genius.[9]

Thirteen months after the events in Bad Love, Delaware meets a former patient who sat on the jury in a serial killer case. The woman suffers recurring nightmares. Delaware must unravel two puzzles: the young woman's recurring nightmares; and the present-day patient who may be the target of a killer. Unraveling the two strands, Kellerman has Delaware face repressed memories, murder groupies, jailhouse autobiographers, all on the trail of a serial killer.[16]

Delaware's friend Milo Sturgis, adds to the portrayal of the post-modern detective. As Gibson explains: "[The] other important male role is Milo, a career policeman, a big shambling bear of a man, but, in a stunning role reversal, he is gay."[4] Milo, Gibson points out, "the gay cop all too often functions as the cavalry. Delaware as amateur Knight Errant often gets into horrendous nightmare difficulties."[4]
The ISBN is for the first U.S. edition of each Alex Delaware novel:[29]
Time Bomb highlights a school shooting at a Los Angeles elementary school; although the only fatality is the shooter herself, Holly Lynn Burden. Holly's father contacts Delaware and asks him to perform a psychological autopsy. During the course of the investigation Delaware encounters dysfunctional families and political extremism as he races to unravel the real villain as he pulls together all the threads.[12]
In the previous books, Kellerman often used a first person narrative form with Alex Delaware's voice, as well as the more objective third person. Character insights have been limited to those observations made by Delaware. However, in this novel, while the first person is limited to Delaware, there are also multiple presentations of the internal perspective of the character of Daniel Sharavi.[19]

In A Cold Heart, Kellerman has Milo Sturgis tell Delaware "I've got a weird one, so naturally I thought of you." Sturgis summons Delaware to an art gallery where a young artist has been murdered and the scene suggests to Delaware the work of a serial killer. Teaming up with Petra Connor and her new partner, Sturgis and Delaware follow the clues to a fanzine writer, and as they track down the clues to the killer, bringing them to the doorstep of Delaware's ex-lover Robin Castagna.[24]

Even hundreds of closed cases to his credit can't keep LAPD lieutenant Milo Sturgis from agonizing over the crimes that don't get solved—and the victims who go without justice. Victims like Katherine Hennepin, a young woman strangled and stabbed in her home. A single suspect with a solid alibi leads to a dead end—one even psychologist Alex Delaware's expert insight can't explain. The only thing to do is move on to the next murder case—because there is always a next one. This time the victim is Ursula Corey, a successful, attractive divorcee who's been gunned down—not a robbery but an execution, a crime that smacks of simple, savage revenge. And along with that theoretical motive come two strong contenders for the role of suspect: the dead woman's business partner/ex-husband and her divorce lawyer/secret lover. But just as Alex and Milo think they're zeroing in on the killer, a bizarre new clue stirs up echoes of the unsolved Hennepin murder. And the discovery of yet another crime scene bearing the same taunting signature raises the specter of a serial killer on a mission, whose twisted method is exceeded only by his manipulative and cunning madness.

The action culminates in a fiery climax, when Delaware's canyon home is destroyed.[15]
A tipsy young woman seeking aid on a desolate highway disappears into the inky black night. A retired schoolteacher is stabbed to death in broad daylight. Two women are butchered after closing time in a small-town beauty parlor. These and other bizarre acts of cruelty and psychopathology are linked only by the killer's use of luxury vehicles and a baffling lack of motive. The ultimate whodunits, these crimes demand the attention of LAPD detective Milo Sturgis and his collaborator on the crime beat, psychologist Alex Delaware.
A serial killer à la Jack the Ripper, with disemboweled victims lined up in ritual precision, where compulsion and obsession mix in an explosive cocktail of violence and gore. A disturbing scenario that involves a former asylum and psychiatric malpractice: it's Alex's habitat indeed, and he knows how to move.
A teenage girl whom Delaware had treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder as a child suddenly wants to see him. The girl's aunt—and adoptive mother—has made a stunning deathbed confession. The ensuing investigation triggers murderous steps to cover up a series of old crimes.[27]

In the thirteenth novel of the Delaware series, Kellerman paints an end-of-millennium Los Angeles reminiscent of Kenneth Millar's works, to whom Kellerman dedicates Monster. Delaware and Sturgis investigate a crime that leads them to an inmate in the Starkweather Hospital for the Criminally Insane. As usual the plot twists as Delaware and Sturgis uncover the monster living openly in society.[20] The novel also offers a realistic depiction of a mental disorder caused by psychiatric drugs; and features a character, wrongfully blamed for a multiple murder, who suffers mental illness as a result of psychoactive medication.[21]

And soon thereafter in a nearby park, another disturbingly bizarre discovery is made not far from the body of a young woman shot in the head. Helping LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis to link these eerie incidents is brilliant psychologist Alex Delaware. But even the good doctor's vast experience with matters both clinical and criminal might not be enough to cut down to the bone of this chilling case—and draw out the disturbing truth.

Kellerman's characterization of Delaware is typical of the "Post-Modern Detective" whom Professor Dick Gibson defines as "often an untrained amateur ... often sensitive, caring, thoughtful and socially aware, and he is often from a traditionally noninvolved group."[4] Kellerman characterizes Delaware as "sensitive, socially involved, loving and passionate about his patients and his family relationships and cynical only about 'bad guys.'" Additionally, Kellerman brings a professional "sophistication" to the series.[4][5]

At first, Amy can't believe her luck at having her childhood idol living right next door, and at first the two women even sense an ethereal connection that bonds them. Later, as their true colors begin to emerge, both Amy and Saffron discover just how toxic their chemistry may be.
Charlie Schmidlin of IndieWire stated "Sustaining a post-child-star career seems a difficult enough labyrinth to manage by itself, but combine that challenge with a bubbly, incessant neighbor intent on stardom, as a new film exploring the toll of celebrity aims to do, and you have an interesting dark vehicle for two talented actresses as a result."[6] Chuck Wilson of the Miami New Times commented "The game of wills [...] between the two women isn't terribly interesting, much less suspenseful, and in fact, it's not clear that director Egidio Coccimiglio and screenwriter Floyd Byars ever settled on whether they were making a thriller or a satire about food and celebrity. The ever-vibrant Graham has fun with Amy's slyly embittered patter to her imaginary TV audience, while Moss valiantly commits herself to Saffron's psychological pain."[7]
Although the film takes place in New York City, principal photography took place in Sault Ste. Marie and Toronto, Ontario.

It focuses on two women occupying neighboring apartments, each one grappling with psychological disorders that begin to overtake their lives.[3] According to the film’s press release: "With images of sumptuous food and sensual enjoyment, the film explores the intimacy between the two through their connection with food, eating disorders and sex.In a battle of wills, one woman overflows with illusions and fearlessly faces life while the other withdraws from everything and fearlessly faces death."[4]
The movie opened for limited release on June 21, 2013.[5]

Greg begins his journey from a lab rat to a field mouse, as the Las Vegas Crime Lab faces a personnel overhaul ("Ch-Ch-Changes"), during the fifth season of CSI. The team's final days together are plagued with more investigations into the insane and the unusual, including the discovery of an "alien" corpse just outside the boundary of Area 51 ("Viva Las Vegas"), a body washed up in a thunderstorm ("Down the Drain"), the kidnapping of a thirteen-year-old girl ("Harvest"), a death at a fumigation ("Crows Feet"), a swingers party ("Swap Meet"), the return of the Blue Paint Killer ("What's Eating Gilbert Grissom?"), and a kidnapping at a hotel ("Formalities"). It's the appearance of new evidence that appears literally as Grissom is on the witness stand, however, that causes Ecklie to separate Grissom and Willows' team ("Mea Culpa"), with Catherine, Nick, and Warrick delving into cases such as brain death ("No Humans Involved"), a body in a car ("Who Shot Sherlock?"), a severed head containing a snake ("Snakes"), the death of a bear ("Unbearable"), and a murder involving sports betting ("Big Middle"). The risk of losing of one of their own, however, allows Ecklie and Grissom to set aside their differences, both personal and professional, and reunite the team once again ("Grave Danger").
CSI Nick Stokes is kidnapped while investigating a crime scene and buried alive in a glass casket by his kidnapper. The Las Vegas Police Department receives a package with a tape and a USB key which allows them to watch Nick inside the casket, together with a request for one million dollars in cash to release him. The mayor refuses to pay the ransom, but Catherine convinces her wealthy father to provide the money. Gil Grissom schedules a meeting with the criminal to deliver the money and be informed where Nick is. After Grissom gives the kidnapper the ransom money, the kidnapper blows himself up without revealing where Nick is buried. The team must then use all their knowledge and resources, as well as race against time, to find Nick before he runs out of air.
