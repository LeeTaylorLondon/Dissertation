Reverence, the picture book village, is a place located in Mira, filled with strange machi
nes, eerie 2d book-like buildings and weird looking residents, characteristics that fit with Mira's "uniqueness".

-In the far back building, there are two chest of drawers. If you search them, you obtain the Tri-Cresendo Pen and the Monolith Pen (obviously named after the developers of the game). If they are used one after the other in battle, you can get the Holy Grail, which can be used in battle to resurrect a character.
After fleeing from the prison in Parnasse, Kalas and his friends go to Reverence looking for answers about Melodia's kidnap and the End Magnus. Here, they visit an old fortune teller (one of the three witches of Wazn in disguise), who reveals that Kalas has no Magnus, unlike other living being (to reach the witch, you must bring a Mirage Weed to one of the inhabitants of Reverence). After talking with her, the group overhear some soldiers talking about some strangers who entered Nekton, the Shrine of Spirits. Hoping to find some clues there, they leave Reverence.

ο Ceti (Latinised to Omicron Ceti) is the star's Bayer designation. It was named Mira (Latin for 'wonderful' or 'astonishing') by Johannes Hevelius in his Historiola Mirae Stellae (1662). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)[13] to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Mira for this star.[14]
From northern temperate latitudes, Mira is generally not visible between late March and June due to its proximity to the Sun. This means that at times several years can pass without it appearing as a naked-eye object.

In 1638 Johannes Holwarda determined a period of the star's reappearances, eleven months; he is often credited with the discovery of Mira's variability. Johannes Hevelius was observing it at the same time and named it Mira in 1662, for it acted like no other known star. Ismail Bouillaud then estimated its period at 333 days, less than one day off the modern value of 332 days. Bouillaud's measurement may not have been erroneous: Mira is known to vary slightly in period, and may even be slowly changing over time. The star is estimated to be a six-billion-year-old red giant.[9]

ο Ceti is a binary stellar system, consisting of a variable red giant (Mira A) along with a white dwarf companion (Mira B). Mira A is a pulsating variable star and was the first non-supernova variable star discovered, with the possible exception of Algol. It is the prototype of the Mira variables.

In 2007, observations showed a protoplanetary disc around the companion, Mira B. This disc is being accreted from material in the solar wind from Mira and could eventually form new planets. These observations also hinted that the companion was a main-sequence star of around 0.7 solar mass and spectral type K, instead of a white dwarf as originally thought.[31] However, in 2010 further research indicated that Mira B is, in fact, a white dwarf.[32]

In Mira, the highest luminosity occurs close to the time when the star is hottest and smallest. The visual magnitude is determined both by the luminosity and by the proportion of the radiation that occurs at visual wavelengths. Only a small proportion of the radiation is emitted at visual wavelengths and this proportion is very strongly influenced by the temperature (Planck's law). Combined with the overall luminosity changes, this creates the very big visual magnitude variation with the maximum occurring when the temperature is high.[10]

Mira A is a variable star, specifically the prototypical Mira variable. The 6,000 to 7,000 known stars of this class[22] are all red giants whose surfaces pulsate in such a way as to increase and decrease in brightness over periods ranging from about 80 to more than 1,000 days.

The companion star is 0.487±0.006 arcseconds away from the main star.[30] It was resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, when it was 70 astronomical units from the primary; and results were announced in 1997. The HST ultraviolet images and later X-ray images by the Chandra space telescope show a spiral of gas rising off Mira in the direction of Mira B. The companion's orbital period around Mira is approximately 400 years.[citation needed]
The overall shape of Mira A has been observed to change, exhibiting pronounced departures from symmetry. These appear to be caused by bright spots on the surface that evolve their shape on time scales of 3–14 months. Observations of Mira A in the ultraviolet band by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown a plume-like feature pointing toward the companion star.[20]

The pulsations of Mira variables cause the star to expand and contract, but also to change its temperature. The temperature is highest slightly after the visual maximum, and lowest slightly before minimum. The photosphere, measured at the Rosseland radius, is smallest just before visual maximum and close to the time of maximum temperature. The largest size is reached slightly before the time of lowest temperature. The bolometric luminosity is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature and the square of the radius, but the radius varies by over 20% and the temperature by less than 10%.[25]

Ultraviolet studies of Mira by NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) space telescope have revealed that it sheds a trail of material from the outer envelope, leaving a tail 13 light-years in length, formed over tens of thousands of years.[26][27] It is thought that a hot bow wave of compressed plasma/gas is the cause of the tail; the bow wave is a result of the interaction of the stellar wind from Mira A with gas in interstellar space, through which Mira is moving at an extremely high speed of 130 kilometres per second (290,000 miles per hour).[28] The tail consists of material stripped from the head of the bow wave, which is also visible in ultraviolet observations. Mira's bow shock will eventually evolve into a planetary nebula, the form of which will be considerably affected by the motion through the interstellar medium (ISM).[29]

There is considerable speculation as to whether Mira had been observed prior to Fabricius. Certainly Algol's history (known for certain as a variable only in 1667, but with legends and such dating back to antiquity showing that it had been observed with suspicion for millennia) suggests that Mira might have been known, too. Karl Manitius, a modern translator of Hipparchus' Commentary on Aratus, has suggested that certain lines from that second-century text may be about Mira. The other pre-telescopic Western catalogs of Ptolemy, al-Sufi, Ulugh Beg and Tycho Brahe turn up no mentions, even as a regular star. There are three observations from Chinese and Korean archives, in 1596, 1070 and the same year when Hipparchus would have made his observation (134 BC) that are suggestive.[citation needed]

Mira A is currently an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, in the thermally pulsing AGB phase.[19][20] Each pulse lasts a decade or more, and an amount of time on the order of 10,000 years passes between each pulse. With every pulse cycle Mira increases in luminosity and the pulses grow stronger. This is also causing dynamic instability in Mira, resulting in dramatic changes in luminosity and size over shorter, irregular time periods.[21]
Infrared VLTI measurements of Mira at phases 0.13, 0.18, 0.26, 0.40 and 0.47, show that the radius varies from 332±38 R☉ at phase 0.13 just after maximum to 402±46 R☉ at phase 0.40 approaching minimum. The temperature at phase 0.13 is 3,192±200 K and 2,918±183 K at phase 0.26 about halfway from maximum to minimum. The luminosity is calculated to be 9,360±3,140 L☉ at phase 0.13 and 8,400±2,820 L☉ at phase 0.26.[10]
In the particular case of Mira, its increases in brightness take it up to about magnitude 3.5 on average, placing it among the brighter stars in the Cetus constellation. Individual cycles vary too; well-attested maxima go as high as magnitude 2.0 in brightness and as low as 4.9, a range almost 15 times in brightness, and there are historical suggestions that the real spread may be three times this or more. Minima range much less, and have historically been between 8.6 and 10.1, a factor of four times in luminosity. The total swing in brightness from absolute maximum to absolute minimum (two events which did not occur on the same cycle) is 1,700 times. Mira emits the vast majority of its radiation in the infrared, and its variability in that band is only about two magnitudes. The shape of its light curve is of an increase over about 100 days, and the return to minimum taking twice as long.[23]

This binary star system consists of a red giant (Mira, designated Mira A) undergoing mass loss and a high-temperature white dwarf companion (Mira B) that is accreting mass from the primary. Such an arrangement of stars is known as a symbiotic system and this is the closest such symbiotic pair to the Sun. Examination of this system by the Chandra X-ray Observatory shows a direct mass exchange along a bridge of matter from the primary to the white dwarf. The two stars are currently separated by about 70 astronomical units.[18]

Evidence that the variability of Mira was known in ancient China, Babylon or Greece is at best only circumstantial.[15] What is certain is that the variability of Mira was recorded by the astronomer David Fabricius beginning on August 3, 1596. Observing what he thought was the planet Mercury (later identified as Jupiter), he needed a reference star for comparing positions and picked a previously unremarked third-magnitude star nearby. By August 21, however, it had increased in brightness by one magnitude, then by October had faded from view. Fabricius assumed it was a nova, but then saw it again on February 16, 1609.[16]

The pulsations of Mira have the effect of expanding its photosphere by around 50% compared to a non-pulsating star. In the case of Mira, if it was not pulsating it is modelled to have a radius of only around 240 R☉.[10]

The distance to Mira is uncertain; pre-Hipparcos estimates centered on 220 light-years;[17] while Hipparcos data from the 2007 reduction suggest a distance of 299 light-years, with a margin of error of 11%.[2]
Parnassus was also the home of Pegasus, the winged horse of Bellerophon.
In some versions of the Greek flood myth, the ark of Deucalion comes to rest on the slopes of Parnassus. This is the version of the myth recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses.
When the wars were over and the region went back to being an active park the new science of ecology brought changes to the park administration. Species were inventoried, endemic and endangered ones were identified, and the concept of a protected area was established. Parnassus National Park became a protected area for birds under the "Birds Directive." Subsequently, it acquired other protections under other laws as required by the EU. After 2000 it became Oros Parnassos, "Mount Parnassus," Natura 2000 protected area ID GR2410002. The two are not exactly identical. The national park is about 150 km2 (37,000 acres). The Natura 2000 area is about 344 km2 (85,000 acres), bringing the terrain not covered by the park under protection..

This relation of the mountain to the Muses offered an instigation for its "mystification" by the poetic-artistic Parnassism movement, established in France in the decade of 1866 to 1876 as a reaction to Romanticism. Parnassism was characterized by a return to some classicistic elements and belief in the doctrine of "Art for the Art", first articulated by Theophile Gautier. The periodical Modern Parnassus, issued by Catul Mendes and Xavier Ricard, contained direct references to Mt. Parnassus and its mythological feature as habitation of the Muses. The Parnassists, who did not exceed a group of twenty poets, exercised a relatively strong influence on the cultural life of Paris, particularly due to their tenacity on perfection of rhyme and vocabulary.Parnassism influenced several French poets, but it also exercised an influence on modern Greek poets, particularly Kostis Palamas and Gryparis.[who?]
The Corycian Cave, located on the slopes of Parnassus, was sacred to Pan and to the Muses.
The consistency, however, ends there. With regard to a possible preponderance of evidence, this one word remains an isolate. There is no historical or archaeological evidence to tie the name to an Anatolian presence. G. Mylonas reviewing the possibilities found nothing at all to tie the archaeology around the mountain to anything Anatolian, and although a probable Cretan connection has been detected, there is nothing to tie the Cretans to the Luwians.[3] Linear A, the script of the Minoans, as the Cretans have been called, remains yet undeciphered. In summary, t he ethnicity of the pre-Greek people or peoples after many decades of scholarship remains yet unknown, and there is yet no explanation of how and when this mountain was named with a Luwian name.

The name of the mountain (Mont Parnasse) was given to a quarter of Paris on the left bank of the Seine, where artists and poets used togather and recite their poems in public. Montparnasse is nowadays one of the most renowned quarters of the city, and in its cemetery many personalities of the arts and culture are buried.[4]

The mountain is delimited to the east by the valley of the Boeotian Kephissus and to the west by the valley of Amfissa. An unusual geological feature of Parnassus is its rich deposits of bauxite, which has led to their systematic mining since the end of the 1930s, resulting in ecological damage to part of the mountain.[4]
However, there is a significant gap in the proto-history of the name, Parnassos. Mycenaean settlements were abundant to the south and east. They had good views of Parnassus, and climbed some part of it frequently, and yet the name remains unattested in what is known of their language, Mycenaean Greek, which is written in Linear B script.

Within a few years the park aspect of the land became dormant as Greece turned its attention toward ending the German occupation, and then after World War II, settling the Greek Civil War. Parnassus was in a unique position to serve as a center for resistance, as it had for the Greek war of independence. Battles were fought in the valleys surrounding the range.
The National Park of Parnassus was founded in 1938. The idea behind the park was to preserve the natural habitat, for which it was necessary to govern the disposition of its natural resources. However, the park did not include all the terrain considered to be in the range. The highest peaks were omitted.
Parnassus is mentioned in early Ancient Greek literature. Many of its ancient communities are cited in Homer's Iliad. From a linguistic point of view, it was home to states of the Dorians, such as the Phokians, who spoke a Doric dialect, Phokian. According to Greek mythology, this mountain was sacred to Dionysus and the Dionysian mysteries; it was also sacred to Apollo and the Corycian nymphs, and it was the home of the Muses.
The construction of the ski resort started in 1975 and was completed in 1976, when the first two drag lifts operated in Fterolaka. In 1981 the construction of a new ski area was completed in Kelaria, while in winter season 1987–1988 the chair lift Hermes started operating and connected the two ski areas. Both ski resorts continued expanding and in 1993 the first high-speed quad in Greece was installed, named Hercules. In 2014–2015 two new hybrid lifts were installed along with a new eight-seater, replacing the old infrastructure.

Parnassus is one of the largest mountainous regions of Mainland Greece and one of the highest Greek mountains. It spreads over three municipalities, namely Boeotia, Phthiotis and Phocis, where its largest part lies. Its altitude is 2,457 meters and its highest peak is Liakouras. To the northwest it is connected to Mount Giona and to the south to Kirphe.

L. Palmer, a philologist, suggested that Parnassus is a name derived from Luwian language, one of the Anatolian languages. In his view, the name derives from parnassas, the possessive adjective of the Luwian word parna meaning house, or specifically temple, so the name effectively means the mountain of the house of the god.[2] Such a derivation, being consistent with the reputation of the mountain as being a holy one, where the power of divinity is manifested, has always been considered a strong one, even by critics of the theory. Palmer goes on to postulate that some pre-Greek people were Anatolian, perhaps from an earlier wave of conquest, and that their country and facilities were taken by the proto-Greeks.

In Book 19 of The Odyssey, Odysseus recounts a story of how he was gored in the thigh during a boar hunt on Mount Parnassus in his youth.
The slopes of Mount Parnassus are composed of two ski sections, Kellaria and Fterolakka, which together make up the largest ski center in Greece. A smaller ski center (only two drag lifts) called Gerontovrahos is across a ridge from Kellaria. Parnassus is mined for its abundant supply of bauxite which is converted to aluminium oxide and then to aluminium.[6]

Pompey Magnus, Roman consul and general who was given the honorific "Magnus"
Magnus, meaning "Great" in Latin, was used as cognomen of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus in the first century BC. The best-known use of the name during the Roman Empire is for the fourth-century Western Roman Emperor Magnus Maximus. The name gained wider popularity in the Middle Ages among various European people who lived in Stykkishólmur in their royal houses, being introduced to them upon being converted to the Latin-speaking Catholic Christianity. This was especially the case with Scandinavian royalty and nobility.

The game was initially created in hopes of making it a franchise,[15] although after its Japanese release, any future releases were described as "undecided" by Monolith Soft.[41] Initially, the only other releases came in the form of two separate novelizations of the game released in Japan; Baten Kaitos: The Destruction of Truth and the Lie of the Promise[b] and Baten Kaitos: Castle of Storms.[c][42]However, work on a video game followup was eventually green-lit; in September 2005, a direct prequel, Baten Kaitos Origins, was announced.[43] It was released late in the GameCube's life-cycle in 2006, garnering a similar critical and commercial reception as the original.[44]

While the game was generally well-received critically, it wasn't seen as having sold very well,[35][36] Publisher Namco had set a sales-goal of 500,000 copies sold worldwide,[37] and initial sales figures fell well-short of it; it had sold only 80,000 copies in Japan after 2 weeks,[38] and only 161,000 copies in North America after its first month and a half on the market.[39] It also sold poorly in comparison to Tales of Symphonia, Namco's other JRPG released along the same time period for the GameCube; which had sold 290,000 copies in Japan,[38] and 285,000 copies in North America.[39] Namco's senior executive officer Youichi Haraguchi stated that the company feared that the title has not fit well with the Gamecube's userbase at the time.[38] Despite this, the game was still considered to have accumulated a "cult following" in the years following its release.[40]
The soundtrack was composed and arranged by Motoi Sakuraba, with Sakuraba personally performing on every track.[23] Over sixty songs were created for the game.[15] He noted the song's opening theme was particularly difficult to create, as the accompanying video has so many frequently changes and movements that needed to be synced with it.[23] The soundtrack album was published by Team Entertainment on December 17, 2003.[24]

Developed specifically for the GameCube due to its lack of JRPGs in its game library, the game was generally well received by critics, but received lukewarm sales. Despite this, a prequel, Baten Kaitos Origins was green-lit and released at the end of the GameCube's lifespan, receiving a similar reception itself. Outside of the cancelled Baten Kaitos DS, no further entries have been announced or released, with the team largely focusing on other projects, like the Xenoblade Chronicles games. In the years following, Monolith Soft staff have mentioned the desire to return to the series should the opportunity ever arise. On February 8, 2023, Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster was announced for a release on the Nintendo Switch in mid-2023.

The party breaks through into Cor Hydrae for a final showdown with Malpercio and Melodia. Malpercio is defeated, Melodia receives free will again, and Kalas, Melodia, and the Guardian Spirit use their powers to release Malpercio's spirit from his body. The energy needed to break the shield around Cor Hydrae drains the energy that allows the five major floating islands to float in the sky, and the islands fall toward the Earth below. However, the planet has now become inhabitable again, and with the help of the five ancient gods, the islands safely fall into place on the planet as continents. While the general population celebrates a bright new future, Xelha privately confides to Kalas that she is an ancient ice queen, and that her death is required in order to restore the oceans of water necessary for humanity to exist again on the planet. A final battle with Geldoblame ensues, and Kalas and Xelha defeat him, but the battle uses the last of Xelha's strength and she dies in Kalas's arms just after confessing her love. All over the world, a rain begins to fall, accumulating into the long-lost ocean. With resolution found, it is deemed time for the "guardian spirit" to leave, with Kalas and the others congregating to say their goodbyes. The guardian spirit sticks around just long enough to see an area boy give Kalas a pendant Xelha had worn throughout the game, saying that he can hear Xelha's voice in it; Kalas puts it up to his ear, and Xelha reappears in a flash of water.
"News: Baten Kaitos Back on Nintendo DS? Page 1 - Cubed3"
In 2011, Eurogamer published a report of a number game titles rumored to bein development, including a Baten Kaitos 3 being in development for the Nintendo 3DS.[50] The game, with the subtitle Silence of the Mechanized Son, was said to feature leaked promotional artwork featuring a blue haired male character with a mechanized wing, and was thought to feature a continuation of Kalas's story from the original game.[50] The report mentioned a 2011 Tokyo Game Show reveal, and while many of the rumored titles surfaced, a Baten Kaitos title did not.[51] In 2018, Honne revealed that a Baten Kaitos 3 had entered pre-production planning shortly after the conclusion of development on Origins/2, though his details differed greatly from the 3DS reports.[52] The game never entered production, but game design documents and concept art had been created.[52] Honne notes the planning happened while Monolith Soft was still owned by Namco Bandai, and talks on creating the game ended due to the circumstances of Nintendo purchasing Monolith Soft from Namco Bandai.[52] The materials and rights to the game were retained by Namco Bandai, though Honne still recalled some details from memory - the third entry would have featured a female protagonist, would have been created for a home console (not the rumored DS/3DS entries), and that it would have been a large-scale adventure exploring land, sea, and sky of a world.[52] Both Honne and Monolith Soft staff member "Kensuke Tsukanaka" have shown interest in making a third entry in the series, but that more fan feedback would be required to be directed at Monolith Soft and Bandai Namco.[52][53]
The world of Baten Kaitos is centered around magic cards called "Magnus", which allows humanity to store the essence of objects or powers in them for later use.[6] In the ancient times prior to the game's events, an evil god Malpercio invades the planet and sucks all of the water out of the ocean.[15] Legendary heroes eventually seal his power away with the five all-powerful "End Magnus", but the planet itself is left uninhabitable, leaving humanity to migrate and live among the floating continents in the sky.[15] Overtime, this causes humans to evolve and grow wings, allowing for limited flight.[16]

The game was generally well received by professional critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game has an average score of 80 out of 100, which indicates "generally favorable reviews" based on 48 reviews.[29] Game Informer praised the game's level of immersion created through the game's graphics and music, stating that ", the world feels alive. The colorful graphics depict storybook settings teeming with movement, complete with swaying leaves and moving clouds. I felt like a child with a picture book, all of the substance and subtlety falling by the wayside in the face of breathtaking environments, slick character designs, and terrifying creatures" and calling the soundtrack "amazing" and "a masterpiece".[31] GameSpot agreed with the notion, stating that it was " a beautiful game with a captivating world, a unique art style and... a great place to go for a nice fairy tale".[4] Game Revolution singled out the game's card-based battle system as a stand-out quality in the game, praising the combination of collectible card games, poker-based moves, and action based combat; concluding that "it becomes quite obvious that the developers put a tremendous amount of time and energy into it. The unique combat is very addictive and a welcome aspect to the RPG genre."[12] IGN similarly praised the game's graphics and battle system, concluding that "Monolith Software has crafted a beautiful and thoroughly engrossing game filled with great characters, impressive visuals and solid combat."[16] GamePro praised the freedom given to the player through the game's many side-quests and ability to avoid random battles.[32] Despite the overall praise, Game Informer criticized the game's storyline and poor voice acting.[31]
Kalas, in his travels to avenge the death of his grandfather and brother, joins Xelha, a good-willed but naive traveler.[12] Together, they inadvertently release the first of the "End Magnus", which is quickly seized by members of the Alfard Empire, a hostile nation on one of the islands.[16] The two chase after them to the Empire's capital, stopping at Diadem along the way, where they meet and team up with Gibari, a fisherman, and Lyude, Diadem's ambassador to the Empire.[11] Upon arrival, they learn there are five End Magnus in total, and the Empire wishes to locate all five of them, which together, will unseal the power of the evil god Malpercio.[16] The party begins an unsuccessful effort to obtain the End Magus to keep them away from the Empire. One is found in Diadem, but is stolen from them immediately. They travel to Anuenue, where they team up with Savyna, an ex-mercenary from the Empire, but are stopped from obtaining an End Magnus by the Empire's emperor, Geldoblame.

The game's story was written by Masato Kato, a prior Squaresoft staff member who had left the company around the same time many of other people had left to form Monolith Soft.[17] He was selected because he having experience working with many team members, such as artist and game design director Yasuyuki Honne, on past projects like Chrono Cross and Xenogears, and for his ability to "write passionate dialogue that doesn't sound weird or embarrassing".[21][17] Many aspects of the game were set very early on in developments, such as the game's setting of the floating islands and having an action theme to the battle.[21] Smaller details of the game were vastly changed over time; the kingdom of Mira originally was envisioned by Honne as "a weird place" outside of the scope of the main game, for the player to go for unrelated events when "the story events got too heavy", but Kato reworked it into its final state in the game as an integral part of the story.[21] Similarly, while the Alfard Empire always existed in the game, its original form was a very small, desolate island rather than a large powerful nation.[21] The game was primarily developed to have 3D character models moving over 2D hand drawn art for the game's general world, to increase the level of detail that could be shown onscreen with the Gamecube's processing power.[21]Honne wished to experiment with other art styles as well, including an entirely 2D segment with 8-bit graphics.[21] Many experiments ensued, though he couldn't figure out how to do it in a meaningful way until he was able to persuade Namco to allow the use of their Tower of Druaga license for the level.[21] Some of the game's sidequests, such as "Quzman's family tree" and the "star map" originated from submissions from the development team after they polled the team for ideas.[21] The team worked with Robot Communications for the opening full motion video (FMV); the game was initially going to have many short videos interspersed throughout the game, but due to budgetary restraints, they decided it would be best to focus on making on large video at the beginning, explaining why the opening video contains so many spoilers upon first viewing.[21]

Kalas, guilty over his deception, vows to reseal Malpercio. Mizuti directs the group to her homeland, a village in the lands below the Taintclouds, a poisonous layer of gas below the floating islands. They venture down to seek the power of the "Sword of the Heavens" to aid their quest; however, Malpercio and Melodia show up, and the two sides clash. The party is able to ward them off, but the Sword of Heavens is broken in the process. The party then learns of one last hope of stopping Melodia and Malpercio: the Magnus of Life. Kalas learns the truth about his origins; Kalas's scientist grandfather, Georg, under the direction of Emperor Geldoblame, used this power to artificially create life – namely Kalas and his brother, Fee. Geldoblame felt Kalas was too human, and only had one wing, and ordered his death. Georg instead fakes his death by blowing up his laboratory, and secretly flees to Mira with Kalas and Fee. Because he was created by the Magnus of Life, however, Kalas can use its power, though he does not yet know how to tap into it.

Experience points are accumulated by winning battles, but may only be applied to a character upon visiting blue flowers across the world, which teleports the party to a church, where one may "pray" to apply the experience points.[13] Doing so allows the player to "level up", leading an increase in the character's primary attributes such as health points, attack strength, or defensive ability, or occasionally "class up" which increases the character's magnus deck capacity.[14]

Prior to a battle, the player must assemble a deck of Magnus for each party member to be used during combat, from which random hands are dealt from during battle.[11] Battles are both turn-based and action-based; each character has both an offensive and defensive turn, where they have a brief number of seconds to quickly play a limited number of cards from their pre-build deck.[4] Weapon cards are used to fight with, armor cards to defend with, and effect cards cause different effects, such as healing.[11] Each Magnus has a spirit number in the corner ranging from 1–9; playing same-number groupings or numbers used in gradual succession (1-2-3-4) result in an increased damage effect; cards with multiple numbers allow for the player to select the more beneficial option.[11] Magnus can also be combined during battle, and when certain Magnus are played, special combos are formed that create new Magnus.[6] For example, playing the healing cards cucumber and honey combine to create a much stronger healing effect through the creation of a honey dew melon card.[12] Additionally, character-specific "finishing move" Magnus may be found over the course of the game, their use leading to especially powerful attacks.[6]

They travel to Mira, Kalas's home nation, where they meet Mizuti, a strange masked being who joins the group. A temporary arrest for being suspected of kidnapping Miran resident Lady Melodia causes them again to lose the only End Magnus they had obtained there. The group escapes to Alfard to stop Geldoblame, but in the confrontation, it is revealed that Kalas had secretly been working for Melodia all along to find the End Magnus and revive Malpercio for her benefit. Melodia takes control of the Empire from Geldoblame, and his former soldiers drive him to the depths of Alfard's Lava Caves. Kalas absorbs the power of the five End Magnus and falls under Malpercio's control. The other members are captured and imprisoned, though Xelha escapes and frees them. They travel to Wazn, an island covered in snow, where they learn that Xelha is its queen. She obtains the Ocean Mirror, which allows Xelha to restore Kalas's free will. Malpercio and Melodia refuge themselves into Cor Hydrae, an ancient fortress also unsealed by the five End Magnus.

The game was always designed to have six playable characters, 3 playable at a time, and between 40 and 50 key non-playable characters, feeling that anymore than that was taxing on the system's hardware, and made it difficult to programm all the different possibilities that can occur in-game.[21] Honne noted that Kalas was most difficult to design, in balancing his wings, cape, and generally garish clothing, which they felt were necessary for his personality.[21] Xehla initially wore a mini-skirt, but was later changed to pants to better meet the game's Middle Eastern theme and her generally active nature.[21] Lyude was initially intended to be more of a coward, but that aspect of his character was removed, as they had a hard time reconciling that trait with his battle animations.[21] Kato insisted that the character Mizuti speak with a certain accent, to the point that he sat in on her, and only her, voice acting recording sessions.[21] Main characters were generally given a central color in their design, to help identify them from a distance.[21] Early character designs initially had larger, anime-styled eyes, but more realistic eye proportions were eventually given to better meld with the 3D character designs, and to better appeal to Western markets.[21] .mw-parser-output .side-box{margin:4px 0;box-sizing:border-box;border:1px solid #aaa;font-size:88%;line-height:1.25em;background-color:#f9f9f9;display:flow-root}.mw-parser-output .side-box-abovebelow,.mw-parser-output .side-box-text{padding:0.25em 0.9em}.mw-parser-output .side-box-image{padding:2px 0 2px 0.9em;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .side-box-imageright{padding:2px 0.9em 2px 0;text-align:center}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .side-box-flex{display:flex;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .side-box-text{flex:1}}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .side-box{width:238px}.mw-parser-output .side-box-right{clear:right;float:right;margin-left:1em}.mw-parser-output .side-box-left{margin-right:1em}}.mw-parser-output .listen .side-box-text{line-height:1.1em}.mw-parser-output .listen-plain{border:none;background:transparent}.mw-parser-output .listen-embedded{width:100%;margin:0;border-width:1px 0 0 0;background:transparent}.mw-parser-output .listen-header{padding:2px}.mw-parser-output .listen-embedded .listen-header{padding:2px 0}.mw-parser-output .listen-file-header{padding:4px 0}.mw-parser-output .listen .description{padding-top:2px}.mw-parser-output .listen .mw-tmh-player{max-width:100%}@media(max-width:719px){.mw-parser-output .listen{clear:both}}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .listen:not(.listen-noimage){width:320px}.mw-parser-output .listen-left{overflow:visible;float:left}.mw-parser-output .listen-center{float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}}

Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean[a] is a role-playing video game developed by Monolith Soft and tri-Crescendo and published by Namco for the GameCube. In it, the player assume the role of a "guardian spirit" – an unseen player avatar – who guides protagonist Kalas and his party of companions in an adventure across an aerial floating island-based kingdom in the clouds. The game is focused around the concept of "Magnus" – magical cards that capture the "essence" of items found in the in-game world. The concept is used as a plot device, for in-game item management, and as a basis for the card-themed battle system. The game was noted for its unique battle system, which included aspects of turn-based and action-based battle systems, collectible card games, and poker.

The series has largely lay dormant since the release of Origins in 2006. In Nintendo's transition from the Gamecube to the Wii video game hardware in 2006, Monolith Soft stated they had no plan to support the Wii with a Baten Kaitos title, instead focusing on other projects, namely what would turn into Disaster: Day of Crisis and Xenoblade Chronicles.[47][22] Meanwhile, Tri-Crescendo went on to develop and release Eternal Sonata in 2007 for the Xbox 360 (and later PlayStation 3), a project company founder Hiroya Hatsushiba stated was only possible due to the experience of co-developing Baten Kaitos.[54] Monolith Soft employees would continue to mention the games on occasion. In 2008, producer Tadashi Nomura stated that "We [...] are still willing to start developing a new Baten Kaitos when the time is ripe."[55] In 2010, in an interview, Honne spoke fondly of Baten Kaitos, calling it his favorite game to work on, and then transitioned into a comment about working on a "secret project", in a way that lead some publications to suggest he may be referring to further Baten Kaitos entries.[56] In 2014, the Baten Kaitos Origins music track "The Valedictory Elegy" appeared in Nintendo's cross over video game Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.[57][58]In 2015, developer Kensuke Tsukanaka revealed in an interview that while the game series was considered for inclusion in the cross over video game Project X Zone, the developers couldn't figure out a way to work it into the game's story.[59] In the same interview, he also stated that while it would be possible to bring back the series, it would require substantial fan feedback encouraging Bandai Namco Entertainment to use the franchise again.[59] The game is mentioned by video game journalists as a game they would desire to be re-released through the Virtual Console for the Nintendo Switch,[60][58] HD remake[61] or sequel,[62] but no further entries have been released to date.

The game's developer, Monolith Soft, was initially founded in October 1999 after its founder, Tetsuya Takahashi, left his previous employer, Squaresoft, after the company refused to green-light funding for a second entry of Takahashi's first major project, Xenogears.[18] Frustrated, Takahashi decided to start his own company, alongside other Squaresoft employees who had previously worked on Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, and Chrono Cross, to further work on the Xeno series.[18] Takahashi started the company through funding from Japanese company Namco, leading them into an ownership role.[18] However, unable to directly continue Xenogears due to Squaresoft still owning the rights to 'it, the company's main focus became to create Takahashi's spiritual successor, the Xenosaga series.[18] Once the company was fully established and staffed, the company decided to start up a secondary project, driven primarily by their younger staff.[19]

Baten Kaitos plays as a Japanese role-playing video game.[2] However, the player does not directly play as the game's protagonist as in most JRPGs, but rather, as a self-named "guardian spirit" that directly interacts with the protagonist through preset text dialogue tree response options.[3] At times, characters will address the player and ask questions, giving the sensation of breaking the fourth wall.[4] Answering questions in a rational manner that mirrors the respective character's mindset strengthens their "bonds", which in turn awards benefits in the game's battle system.[4] Outside of this indirect way of advising and guiding the flow of the game,[5] the game plays as a traditional RPG, with the player directing characters in the exploration of a game world and in combat against opponents in battles.[2][4]

The game's mechanics rely heavily on magical cards known as "Magnus", which absorb the essence of real-world objects for storage and later use, acting as a container for items, as a sense of inventory management.[6][7] Some objects are already found in their card form, while others are found and needed to extracted into blanks Magnus cards.[8] Over 1,000 different Magnus exist in the game.[5] Magnus are used in a multitude of ways; Magnus containing food or medicine may be used to heal or temporarily invigorate characters, Magnus containing weapons or armor may be equipped to strengthen characters, Magnus containing battle moves may be put into the players deck and used as attacks in battles, and Magnus may be used to interact with non-playable characters to reveal new conversations or complete various quests.[7][8] Magnus change automatically in real-time as well, for better and worse; a Magnus containing milk that would heal the player may eventually curdle into cheese, which may heal the character even more, or a Magnus containing a ripe banana may turn into a rotten banana, which would in turn hurt the character if consumed.[7][9] Additionally, a camera Magnus may be used in battle to take photographs of enemies, which can in turn be sold for varying amounts of money, based on picture quality and rarity of image captured.[10]

The game's initial concept was created in 2001, with development beginning six months later.[15] Monolith Soft, at the time only really known for the Xenosaga games,[17] clarified after its announcement that while they would be utilizing their development experience from creating said games, the game would not have any actual connection to the Xenosaga series.[20] The Nintendo GameCube was chosen as the game's platform due to the general lack of JRPGs in its game library; the team wanted to offer a "true RPG" for the userbase, and eventually establish it as a franchise for the system.[15] It was named Baten Kaitos after the star of the same name in the Cetus constellation; the name was chosen to be symbolic of rich nature and the grand world view the team aimed to depict with the game,[15] and as a "anti-Xenosaga" game, which instead a space opera.[21] The game was co-developed by Tri-Crescendo, and was the company's first venture into full-fledged video game development, previously only dealing with music and sound in video games.[22] Both Monolith Soft and Tri-Crescendo had recently sent similar game pitches to Namco, leading Namco to suggest the two companies work together.[21] Tri-Crescendo was primarily responsible for the game's battle system and sound design.[22] Game development approximately consisted of a staff of about 50 people over the course of an 18-month time period,[22] leading to a cumulative 2 years process from inception to finish.[21]
