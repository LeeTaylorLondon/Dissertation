It can be shown that f(z) converges to a finite value if and only if z is not a negative real number such that z < −1⁄4. In other words, the convergence region for this continued fraction is the cut plane, where the cut runs along the negative real axis, from −1⁄4 to the point at infinity.[8]
(1 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space, also known as the split-complex plane, is a "complex plane" in the sense that the algebraic split-complex numbers can be separated into two real components that are easily associated with the point (x, y) in the Cartesian plane.
This problem arises because the point z = 0 has just one square root, while every other complex number z ≠ 0 has exactly two square roots. On the real number line we could circumvent this problem by erecting a "barrier" at the single point x = 0. A bigger barrier is needed in the complex plane, to prevent any closed contour from completely encircling the branch point z = 0. This is commonly done by introducing a branch cut; in this case the "cut" might extend from the point z = 0 along the positive real axis to the point at infinity, so that the argument of the variable z in the cut plane is restricted to the range 0 ≤ arg(z) < 2π.
and often think of the function f as a transformation from the z-plane (with coordinates (x, y)) into the w-plane (with coordinates (u, v)).
Another related use of the complex plane is with the Nyquist stability criterion.This is a geometric principle which allows the stability of a closed-loop feedback system to be determined by inspecting a Nyquist plot of its open-loop magnitude and phase response as a function of frequency (or loop transfer function) in the complex plane.
Evidently, as z moves all the way around the circle, w only traces out one-half of the circle. So one continuous motion in the complex plane has transformed the positive square root e0 = 1 into the negative square root eiπ = −1.
A meromorphic function is a complex function that is holomorphic and therefore analytic everywhere in its domain except at a finite, or countably infinite, number of points.[note 4] The points at which such a function cannot be defined are called the poles of the meromorphic function. Sometimes all of these poles lie in a straight line. In that case mathematicians may say that the function is "holomorphic on the cut plane". Here's a simple example.
to be the non-negative real number y such that y2 = x. This idea doesn't work so well in the two-dimensional complex plane. To see why, let's think about the way the value of f(z) varies as the point z moves around the unit circle. We can write

In the Cartesian plane the point (x, y) can also be represented in polar coordinates as
Argand diagram refers to a geometric plot of complex numbers as points z = x + iy using the x-axis as the real axis and the y-axis as the imaginary axis.[3] Such plots are named after Jean-Robert Argand (1768–1822), although they were first described by Norwegian–Danish land surveyor and mathematician Caspar Wessel (1745–1818).[note 3] Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the zeros and poles of a function in the complex plane.
Since z2 = (−z)2 for every complex number z, it's clear that f(z) is an even function of z, so the analysis can be restricted to one half of the complex plane. And since the series is undefined when
To understand why f is single-valued in this domain, imagine a circuit around the unit circle, starting with z = 1 on the first sheet. When 0 ≤ θ < 2π we are still on the first sheet. When θ = 2π we have crossed over onto the second sheet, and are obliged to make a second complete circuit around the branch point z = 0 before returning to our starting point, where θ = 4π is equivalent to θ = 0, because of the way we glued the two sheets together. In other words, as the variable z makes two complete turns around the branch point, the image of z in the w-plane traces out just one complete circle.
This is not the only possible yet plausible stereographic situation of the projection of a sphere onto a plane consisting of two or more values. For instance, the north pole of the sphere might be placed on top of the origin z = −1 in a plane that is tangent to the circle. The details don't really matter. Any stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane will produce one "point at infinity", and it will map the lines of latitude and longitude on the sphere into circles and straight lines, respectively, in the plane.
Here the polynomial z2 − 1 vanishes when z = ±1, so g evidently has two branch points. We can "cut" the plane along the real axis, from −1 to 1, and obtain a sheet on which g(z) is a single-valued function. Alternatively, the cut can run from z = 1 along the positive real axis through the point at infinity, then continue "up" the negative real axis to the other branch point, z = −1.
The z-plane is a discrete-time version of the s-plane, where z-transforms are used instead of the Laplace transformation.
^ When Re(z) > 0 this sum converges uniformly on any bounded domain by comparison with ζ(2), where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.
This situation is most easily visualized by using the stereographic projection described above. On the sphere one of these cuts runs longitudinally through the southern hemisphere, connecting a point on the equator (z = −1) with another point on the equator (z = 1), and passing through the south pole (the origin, z = 0) on the way. The second version of the cut runs longitudinally through the northern hemisphere and connects the same two equatorial points by passing through the north pole (that is, the point at infinity).
can be made into a single-valued function by splitting the domain of f into two disconnected sheets. It is also possible to "glue" those two sheets back together to form a single Riemann surface on which f(z) = z1/2 can be defined as a holomorphic function whose image is the entire w-plane (except for the point w = 0). Here's how that works.
Almost all of complex analysis is concerned with complex functions – that is, with functions that map some subset of the complex plane into some other (possibly overlapping, or even identical) subset of the complex plane. Here it is customary to speak of the domain of f(z) as lying in the z-plane, while referring to the range of f(z) as a set of points in the w-plane. In symbols we write
^ A detailed definition of the complex argument in terms of the complete arctangent can be found at the description of the atan2 function.
for example: z = 4 + 5i, where x and y are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit. In this customary notation the complex number z corresponds to the point (x, y) in the Cartesian plane.

The branch cut in this example doesn't have to lie along the real axis. It doesn't even have to be a straight line. Any continuous curve connecting the origin z = 0 with the point at infinity would work. In some cases the branch cut doesn't even have to pass through the point at infinity. For example, consider the relationship
from which we can conclude that the derivative of f exists and is finite everywhere on the Riemann surface, except when z = 0 (that is, f is holomorphic, except when z = 0).
It can be useful to think of the complex plane as if it occupied the surface of a sphere. Given a sphere of unit radius, place its center at the origin of the complex plane, oriented so that the equator on the sphere coincides with the unit circle in the plane, and the north pole is "above" the plane.
When discussing functions of a complex variable it is often convenient to think of a cut in the complex plane. This idea arises naturally in several different contexts.
^ All the familiar properties of the complex exponential function, the trigonometric functions, and the complex logarithm can be deduced directly from the power series for ez{\displaystyle e^{z}}. In particular, the principal value of log⁡r{\displaystyle \log r}, where |r|=1{\displaystyle |r|=1}, can be calculated without reference to any geometrical or trigonometric construction.[1]
The preceding sections of this article deal with the complex plane in terms of a geometric representation of the complex numbers. Although this usage of the term "complex plane" has a long and mathematically rich history, it is by no means the only mathematical concept that can be characterized as "the complex plane". There are at least three additional possibilities.
Under this stereographic projection the north pole itself is not associated with any point in the complex plane. We perfect the one-to-one correspondence by adding one more point to the complex plane – the so-called point at infinity – and identifying it with the north pole on the sphere. This topological space, the complex plane plus the point at infinity, is known as the extended complex plane. We speak of a single "point at infinity" when discussing complex analysis. There are two points at infinity (positive, and negative) on the real number line, but there is only one point at infinity (the north pole) in the extended complex plane.[5]
All the familiar properties of the complex exponential function, the trigonometric functions, and the complex logarithm can be deduced directly from the power series for ez{\displaystyle e^{z}}.

Many complex functions are defined by infinite series, or by continued fractions. A fundamental consideration in the analysis of these infinitely long expressions is identifying the portion of the complex plane in which they converge to a finite value. A cut in the plane may facilitate this process, as the following examples show.
The complex plane is sometimes known as the Argand plane or Gauss plane.
While seldom used explicitly, the geometric view of the complex numbers is implicitly based on its structure of a Euclidean vector space of dimension 2, where the inner product of complex numbers w and z is given by ℜ(wz¯){\displaystyle \Re (w{\overline {z}})}; then for a complex number z its absolute value |z| coincides with its Euclidean norm, and its argument arg(z) with the angle turning from 1 to z.
Imagine for a moment what will happen to the lines of latitude and longitude when they are projected from the sphere onto the flat plane. The lines of latitude are all parallel to the equator, so they will become perfect circles centered on the origin z = 0. And the lines of longitude will become straight lines passing through the origin (and also through the "point at infinity", since they pass through both the north and south poles on the sphere).
where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant, and has simple poles at 0, −1, −2, −3, ... because exactly one denominator in the infinite product vanishes when z is zero, or a negative integer.[note 5] Since all its poles lie on the negative real axis, from z = 0 to the point at infinity, this function might be described as "holomorphic on the cut plane, the cut extending along the negative real axis, from 0 (inclusive) to the point at infinity."
In mathematics, the complex plane is the plane formed by the complex numbers, with a Cartesian coordinate system such that the x-axis, called the real axis, is formed by the real numbers, and the y-axis, called the imaginary axis, is formed by the imaginary numbers.
it makes sense to cut the plane along the entire imaginary axis and establish the convergence of this series where the real part of z is not zero before undertaking the more arduous task of examining f(z) when z is a pure imaginary number.[note 6]
In control theory, one use of the complex plane is known as the s-plane.It is used to visualise the roots of the equation describing a system's behaviour (the characteristic equation) graphically.The equation is normally expressed as a polynomial in the parameter 's' of the Laplace transform, hence the name 's' plane. Points in the s-plane take the form s=σ+jω{\displaystyle s=\sigma +j\omega }, where 'j' is used instead of the usual 'i' to represent the imaginary component.
The infinite product for Γ(z) is uniformly convergent on any bounded region where none of its denominators vanish; therefore it defines a meromorphic function on the complex plane.[7]

Alternatively, Γ(z) might be described as "holomorphic in the cut plane with −π < arg(z) < π and excluding the point z = 0."
We can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the points on the surface of the sphere minus the north pole and the points in the complex plane as follows. Given a point in the plane, draw a straight line connecting it with the north pole on the sphere. That line will intersect the surface of the sphere in exactly one other point. The point z = 0 will be projected onto the south pole of the sphere. Since the interior of the unit circle lies inside the sphere, that entire region (|z|  1) will be mapped onto the northern hemisphere, minus the north pole. Clearly this procedure is reversible – given any point on the surface of the sphere that is not the north pole, we can draw a straight line connecting that point to the north pole and intersecting the flat plane in exactly one point.

In the Cartesian plane it may be assumed that the arctangent takes values from −π/2 to π/2 (in radians), and some care must be taken to define the more complete arctangent function for points (x, y) when x ≤ 0.[note 1] In the complex plane these polar coordinates take the form
The theory of contour integration comprises a major part of complex analysis. In this context, the direction of travel around a closed curve is important – reversing the direction in which the curve is traversed multiplies the value of the integral by −1. By convention the positive direction is counterclockwise. For example, the unit circle is traversed in the positive direction when we start at the point z = 1, then travel up and to the left through the point z = i, then down and to the left through −1, then down and to the right through −i, and finally up and to the right to z = 1, where we started.
The complex plane allows a geometric interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed more easily in polar coordinates—the magnitude or modulus of the product is the product of the two absolute values, or moduli, and the angle or argument of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.
Before we can treat this relationship as a single-valued function, the range of the resulting value must be restrictedsomehow. When dealing with the square roots of non-negative real numbers this is easily done. For instance, we can just define

^ The infinite product for Γ(z) is uniformly convergent on any bounded region where none of its denominators vanish; therefore it defines a meromorphic function on the complex plane.[7]
In this example the cut is a mere convenience, because the points at which the infinite sum is undefined are isolated, and the cut plane can be replaced with a suitably punctured plane. In some contexts the cut is necessary, and not just convenient. Consider the infinite periodic continued fraction

We can now give a complete description of w = z.mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}1⁄2. To do so we need two copies of the z-plane, each of them cut along the real axis. On one copy we define the square root of 1 to be e0 = 1, and on the other we define the square root of 1 to be eiπ = −1. We call these two copies of the complete cut plane sheets. By making a continuity argument we see that the (now single-valued) function w = z1⁄2 maps the first sheet into the upper half of the w-plane, where 0 ≤ arg(w) < π, while mapping the second sheet into the lower half of the w-plane (where π ≤ arg(w) < 2π).[6]
This cut is slightly different from the branch cut we've already encountered, because it actually excludes the negative real axis from the cut plane. The branch cut left the real axis connected with the cut plane on one side (0 ≤ θ), but severed it from the cut plane along the other side (θ < 2π).
When Re(z) > 0 this sum converges uniformly on any bounded domain by comparison with ζ(2), where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.
The complex plane is associated with two distinct quadratic spaces. For a point z = x + iy in the complex plane, the squaring function z2 and the norm-squared x2+y2{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}} are both quadratic forms. The former is frequently neglected in the wake of the latter's use in setting a metric on the complex plane. These distinct faces of the complex plane as a quadratic space arise in the construction of algebras over a field with the Cayley–Dickson process. That procedure can be applied to any field, and different results occur for the fields R and C: when R is the take-off field, then C is constructed with the quadratic form x2+y2,{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2},} but the process can also begin with C and z2, and that case generates algebras that differ from those derived from R. In any case, the algebras generated are composition algebras; in this case the complex plane is the point set for two distinct composition algebras.

The set of dual numbers over the reals can also be placed into one-to-one correspondence with the points (x, y) of the Cartesian plane, and represent another example of a "complex plane".
In complex analysis, the complex numbers are customarily represented by the symbol z, which can be separated into its real (x) and imaginary (y) parts:

Here |z| is the absolute value or modulus of the complex number z;θ, the argument of z, is usually taken on the interval 0 ≤ θ < 2π; and the last equality (to |z|eiθ) is taken from Euler's formula. Without the constraint on the range of θ, the argument of z is multi-valued, because the complex exponential function is periodic, with period 2π i. Thus, if θ is one value of arg(z), the other values are given by arg(z) = θ + 2nπ, where n is any non-zero integer.[2]
A detailed definition of the complex argument in terms of the complete arctangent can be found at the description of the atan2 function.
Of course, it's not actually necessary to exclude the entire line segment from z = 0 to −∞ to construct a domain in which Γ(z) is holomorphic. All we really have to do is puncture the plane at a countably infinite set of points {0, −1, −2, −3, ...}. But a closed contour in the punctured plane might encircle one or more of the poles of Γ(z), giving a contour integral that is not necessarily zero, by the residue theorem. By cutting the complex plane we ensure not only that Γ(z) is holomorphic in this restricted domain – we also ensure that the contour integral of Γ over any closed curve lying in the cut plane is identically equal to zero.
A major application of certain complex spaces is in quantum mechanics as wave functions.
A bounded function that is holomorphic in the entire complex plane must be constant; this is Liouville's theorem. It can be used to provide a natural and short proof for the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed.
An important property of holomorphic functions is the relationship between the partial derivatives of their real and imaginary components, known as the Cauchy–Riemann conditions.If f:C→C{\displaystyle f:\mathbb {C} \to \mathbb {C} }, defined by f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y){\displaystyle f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)}, where x,y,u(x,y),v(x,y)∈R{\displaystyle x,y,u(x,y),v(x,y)\in \mathbb {R} }, is holomorphic on a region Ω{\displaystyle \Omega }, then for all z0∈Ω{\displaystyle z_{0}\in \Omega },
A complex function is a function from complex numbers to complex numbers. In other words, it is a function that has a subset of the complex numbers as a domain and the complex numbers as a codomain. Complex functions are generally supposed to have a domain that contains a nonempty open subset of the complex plane.

In mathematics, a conformal map is a function that locally preserves angles, but not necessarily lengths.
Holomorphic functions exhibit some remarkable features.For instance, Picard's theorem asserts that the range of an entire function can take only three possible forms: C{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }, C∖{z0}{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \setminus \{z_{0}\}}, or {z0}{\displaystyle \{z_{0}\}} for some z0∈C{\displaystyle z_{0}\in \mathbb {C} }. In other words, if two distinct complex numbers z{\displaystyle z} and w{\displaystyle w} are not in the range of an entire function f{\displaystyle f}, then f{\displaystyle f} is a constant function.Moreover, a holomorphic function on a connected open set is determined by its restriction to any nonempty open subset.
Superficially, this definition is formally analogous to that of the derivative of a real function.However, complex derivatives and differentiable functions behave in significantly different ways compared to their real counterparts.In particular, for this limit to exist, the value of the difference quotient must approach the same complex number, regardless of the manner in which we approach z0{\displaystyle z_{0}} in the complex plane.Consequently, complex differentiability has much stronger implications than real differentiability. For instance, holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable, whereas the existence of the nth derivative need not imply the existence of the (n + 1)th derivative for real functions.Furthermore, all holomorphic functions satisfy the stronger condition of analyticity, meaning that the function is, at every point in its domain, locally given by a convergent power series. In essence, this means that functions holomorphic on Ω{\displaystyle \Omega } can be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomials in some neighborhood of every point in Ω{\displaystyle \Omega }. This stands in sharp contrast to differentiable real functions; there are infinitely differentiable real functions that are nowhere analytic; see Non-analytic smooth function § A smooth function which is nowhere real analytic.
In terms of the real and imaginary parts of the function, u and v, this is equivalent to the pair of equations ux=vy{\displaystyle u_{x}=v_{y}} and uy=−vx{\displaystyle u_{y}=-v_{x}}, where the subscripts indicate partial differentiation.However, the Cauchy–Riemann conditions do not characterize holomorphic functions, without additional continuity conditions (see Looman–Menchoff theorem).

Similarly, any complex-valued function f on an arbitrary set X (is isomorphic to, and therefore, in that sense, it) can be considered as an ordered pair of two real-valued functions: (Re f, Im f) or, alternatively, as a vector-valued function from X into R2.{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}.}
One of the central tools in complex analysis is the line integral. The line integral around a closed path of a function that is holomorphic everywhere inside the area bounded by the closed path is always zero, as is stated by the Cauchy integral theorem. The values of such a holomorphic function inside a disk can be computed by a path integral on the disk's boundary (as shown in Cauchy's integral formula). Path integrals in the complex plane are often used to determine complicated real integrals, and here the theory of residues among others is applicable (see methods of contour integration). A "pole" (or isolated singularity) of a function is a point where the function's value becomes unbounded, or "blows up". If a function has such a pole, then one can compute the function's residue there, which can be used to compute path integrals involving the function; this is the content of the powerful residue theorem. The remarkable behavior of holomorphic functions near essential singularities is described by Picard's theorem. Functions that have only poles but no essential singularities are called meromorphic. Laurent series are the complex-valued equivalent to Taylor series, but can be used to study the behavior of functions near singularities through infinite sums of more well understood functions, such as polynomials.
Complex functions that are differentiable at every point of an open subset Ω{\displaystyle \Omega } of the complex plane are said to be holomorphic on Ω{\displaystyle \Omega }. In the context of complex analysis, the derivative of f{\displaystyle f} at z0{\displaystyle z_{0}} is defined to be[1]
If a function is holomorphic throughout a connected domain then its values are fully determined by its values on any smaller subdomain.The function on the larger domain is said to be analytically continued from its values on the smaller domain.This allows the extension of the definition of functions, such as the Riemann zeta function, which are initially defined in terms of infinite sums that converge only on limited domains to almost the entire complex plane.Sometimes, as in the case of the natural logarithm, it is impossible to analytically continue a holomorphic function to a non-simply connected domain in the complex plane but it is possible to extend it to a holomorphic function on a closely related surface known as a Riemann surface.

Complex analysis is one of the classical branches in mathematics, with roots in the 18th century and just prior. Important mathematicians associated with complex numbers include Euler, Gauss, Riemann, Cauchy, Gösta Mittag-Leffler, Weierstrass, and many more in the 20th century. Complex analysis, in particular the theory of conformal mappings, has many physical applications and is also used throughout analytic number theory. In modern times, it has become very popular through a new boost from complex dynamics and the pictures of fractals produced by iterating holomorphic functions.Another important application of complex analysis is in string theory which examines conformal invariants in quantum field theory.
The conformal property may be described in terms of the Jacobian derivative matrix of a coordinate transformation. The transformation is conformal whenever the Jacobian at each point is a positive scalar times a rotation matrix (orthogonal with determinant one). Some authors define conformality to include orientation-reversing mappingswhose Jacobians can be written as any scalar times any orthogonal matrix.[2]

More formally, let U{\displaystyle U} and V{\displaystyle V} be open subsets of Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}. A function f:U→V{\displaystyle f:U\to V} is called conformal (or angle-preserving) at a point u0∈U{\displaystyle u_{0}\in U} if it preserves angles between directed curves through u0{\displaystyle u_{0}}, as well as preserving orientation. Conformal maps preserve both angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures, but not necessarily their size or curvature.

Complex analysis, traditionally known as the theory of functions of a complex variable, is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers. It is helpful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, analytic combinatorics, applied mathematics; as well as in physics, including the branches of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and particularly quantum mechanics. By extension, use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields such as nuclear, aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineering.[citation needed]
For any complex function, the values z{\displaystyle z} from the domain and their images f(z){\displaystyle f(z)} in the range may be separated into real and imaginary parts:
Some properties of complex-valued functions (such as continuity) are nothing more than the corresponding properties of vector valued functions of two real variables. Other concepts of complex analysis, such as differentiability, are direct generalizations of the similar concepts for real functions, but may have very different properties. In particular, every differentiable complex function is analytic (see next section), and two differentiable functions that are equal in a neighborhood of a point are equal on the intersection of their domain (if the domains are connected). The latter property is the basis of the principle of analytic continuation which allows extending every real analytic function in a unique way for getting a complex analytic function whose domain is the whole complex plane with a finite number of curve arcs removed. Many basic and special complex functions are defined in this way, including the complex exponential function, complex logarithm functions, and trigonometric functions.

Most elementary functions, including the exponential function, the trigonometric functions, and all polynomial functions, extended appropriately to complex arguments as functions C→C{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \to \mathbb {C} }, are holomorphic over the entire complex plane, making them entire functions, while rational functions p/q{\displaystyle p/q}, where p and q are polynomials, are holomorphic on domains that exclude points where q is zero.Such functions that are holomorphic everywhere except a set of isolated points are known as meromorphic functions.On the other hand, the functions z↦ℜ(z){\displaystyle z\mapsto \Re (z)}, z↦|z|{\displaystyle z\mapsto |z|}, and z↦z¯{\displaystyle z\mapsto {\bar {z}}} are not holomorphic anywhere on the complex plane, as can be shown by their failure to satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann conditions (see below).

All this refers to complex analysis in one variable. There is also a very rich theory of complex analysis in more than one complex dimension in which the analytic properties such as power series expansion carry over whereas most of the geometric properties of holomorphic functions in one complex dimension (such as conformality) do not carry over. The Riemann mapping theorem about the conformal relationship of certain domains in the complex plane, which may be the most important result in the one-dimensional theory, fails dramatically in higher dimensions.

For mappings in two dimensions, the (orientation-preserving) conformal mappings are precisely the locally invertible complex analytic functions. In three and higher dimensions, Liouville's theorem sharply limits the conformal mappings to a few types.

As a differentiable function of a complex variable is equal to its Taylor series (that is, it is analytic), complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable (that is, holomorphic functions).
where Θ is (the sheaf of germs of sections of) the holomorphic tangent bundle. There is an obstruction in the H2 of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the H1 vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the Hodge number h1,0 which is therefore 1.It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form y2 = x3 + ax + b.These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter.Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves.It turns out that curves for which b2a−3 has the same value, describe isomorphic curves.I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve y2 = x3 + ax + b, but not all variations of a,b actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.

where Ω is the holomorphic cotangent bundle and the notation Ω[2] means the tensor square (not the second exterior power). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called Teichmüller space in this case, is computed as 3g − 3, by the Riemann–Roch theorem.
were df{\displaystyle df} is the jacobian matrix of f=(f1,…,fm):Cn→Cm{\displaystyle f=(f_{1},\ldots ,f_{m}):\mathbb {C} ^{n}\to \mathbb {C} ^{m}}. For example, the deformations of a hypersurface given by f{\displaystyle f} has the deformations

A pre-deformation functor is called smooth if for any surjection A′→A{\displaystyle A'\to A} such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection
In mathematics, deformation theory is the study of infinitesimal conditions associated with varying a solution P of a problem to slightly different solutions Pε, where ε is a small number, or a vector of small quantities. The infinitesimal conditions are the result of applying the approach of differential calculus to solving a problem with constraints. The name is an analogy to non-rigid structures that deform slightly to accommodate external forces.
Another application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation

One of the useful and readily computable areas of deformation theory comes from the deformation theory of germs of complex spaces, such as stein manifolds, complex manifolds, or complex analytic varieties.[1] Note that this theory can be globalized to complex manifolds and complex analytic spaces by considering the sheaves of germs of holomorphic functions, tangent spaces, etc. Such algebras are of the form
The most general form of a deformation is a flat map f:X→S{\displaystyle f:X\to S} of complex-analytic spaces, schemes, or germs of functions on a space. Grothendieck[1] was the first to find this far-reaching generalization for deformations and developed the theory in that context. The general idea is there should exist a universal family X→B{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {X}}\to B} such that any deformation can be found as a unique pullback square
X→X2→X3→⋯↓↓↓Spec⁡(Fp)→Spec⁡(Z/(p2))→Spec⁡(Z/(p3))→⋯{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}X&\to &{\mathfrak {X}}_{2}&\to &{\mathfrak {X}}_{3}&\to \cdots \\\downarrow &&\downarrow &&\downarrow &\\\operatorname {Spec} (\mathbb {F} _{p})&\to &\operatorname {Spec} (\mathbb {Z} /(p^{2}))&\to &\operatorname {Spec} (\mathbb {Z} /(p^{3}))&\to \cdots \end{matrix}}}
In the case of Riemann surfaces, one can explain that the complex structure on the Riemann sphere is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an elliptic curve has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in elliptic function theory. The general Kodaira–Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the sheaf cohomology group
Moreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras k[y]/(yk){\displaystyle k[y]/(y^{k})}. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then
hence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of x3{\displaystyle x^{3}} is 6x{\displaystyle 6x}.
If we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square
In general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.
for an arbitrary smooth curve of genus g{\displaystyle g} because the deformation space is the tangent space of the moduli space. Using Serre duality the tangent space is isomorphic to
Another method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category Artk{\displaystyle {\text{Art}}_{k}} of local Artin algebras over a field. A pre-deformation functor is defined as a functor
⋯→sR−2→sR−1→sR0→pA→0{\displaystyle \cdots \xrightarrow {s} R_{-2}\xrightarrow {s} R_{-1}\xrightarrow {s} R_{0}\xrightarrow {p} A\to 0}
X→X→X′↓↓↓Spec⁡(k)→Spec⁡(A)→Spec⁡(A′){\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}X&\to &{\mathfrak {X}}&\to &{\mathfrak {X}}'\\\downarrow &&\downarrow &&\downarrow \\\operatorname {Spec} (k)&\to &\operatorname {Spec} (A)&\to &\operatorname {Spec} (A')\end{matrix}}}
These deformations have an equivalence relation given by commutative squares
The most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of complex manifolds and algebraic varieties. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of Kunihiko Kodaira and Donald C. Spencer, after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the Italian school of algebraic geometry. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the Zariski tangent space with a moduli space. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.
One of the first properties of the moduli of algebraic curves Mg{\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}_{g}} can be deduced using elementary deformation theory. Its dimension can be computed as
X→X2↓↓Spec⁡(Fp)→Spec⁡(Z/(p2)){\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}X&\to &{\mathfrak {X}}_{2}\\\downarrow &&\downarrow \\\operatorname {Spec} (\mathbb {F} _{p})&\to &\operatorname {Spec} (\mathbb {Z} /(p^{2}))\end{matrix}}}
This implies that we can construct a formal scheme X=Spet⁡(X∙){\displaystyle {\mathfrak {X}}=\operatorname {Spet} ({\mathfrak {X}}_{\bullet })} giving a curve over Zp{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}}.

Although in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of groupoids instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.
A simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of monomials using infinitesimals:
Recall that the tangent space of a scheme X{\displaystyle X} can be described as the Hom{\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} }-set
C{x,y}(y2−xn)←C{x,y,s}(y2−xn+s)↑↑C←C{s}{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {\mathbb {C} \{x,y\}}{(y^{2}-x^{n})}}&\leftarrow &{\frac {\mathbb {C} \{x,y,s\}}{(y^{2}-x^{n}+s)}}\\\uparrow &&\uparrow \\\mathbb {C} &\leftarrow &\mathbb {C} \{s\}\end{matrix}}}
where the source is the ring of dual numbers. Since we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as

Then, by taking the differential graded module of derivations (Der(R∙),d){\displaystyle ({\text{Der}}(R_{\bullet }),d)}, its cohomology forms the tangent cohomology of the germ of analytic algebras A{\displaystyle A}. These cohomology groups are denoted Tk(A){\displaystyle T^{k}(A)}.

Deformation theory was famously applied in birational geometry by Shigefumi Mori to study the existence of rational curves on varieties.[2] For a Fano variety of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as Mori's bend-and-break. The rough idea is to start with some curve C through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several components. Replacing C by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the genus or the degree of C. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we'll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of C require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to positive characteristic.

the ε{\displaystyle \varepsilon } term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring k[y]/(y2){\displaystyle k[y]/(y^{2})} we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation k[ε]=k[y]/(y2){\displaystyle k[\varepsilon ]=k[y]/(y^{2})}, which is called the Ring of dual numbers.
Recall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as
The so-called Deligne conjecture arising in the context of algebras (and Hochschild cohomology) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to string theory (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory)[citation needed]. This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements. Maxim Kontsevich is among those who have offered a generally accepted proof of this[citation needed].
Some characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the ε quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of isolated solutions, in that varying a solution may not be possible, or does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually 'integrate', so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in physics and engineering. For example, in the geometry of numbers a class of results called isolation theorems was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an open orbit (of a group action) around a given solution. Perturbation theory also looks at deformations, in general of operators.
The Serre–Tate theorem asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of abelian scheme A is controlled by deformations of the p-divisible group A[p∞]{\displaystyle A[p^{\infty }]} consisting of its p-power torsion points.
These examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of differential geometry; the assimilation of the Kodaira–Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of Grothendieck, with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.
Infinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials F(x,ε){\displaystyle F(x,\varepsilon )} with an infinitesimal ε{\displaystyle \varepsilon }, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider
T1(A)≅An(∂f∂z1,…,∂f∂zn){\displaystyle T^{1}(A)\cong {\frac {A^{n}}{\left({\frac {\partial f}{\partial z_{1}}},\ldots ,{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z_{n}}}\right)}}}
In many cases, this universal family is either a Hilbert scheme or Quot scheme, or a quotient of one of them. For example, in the construction of the Moduli of curves, it is constructed as a quotient of the smooth curves in the Hilbert scheme. If the pullback square is not unique, then the family is only versal.
This is motivated by the following question: given a deformation

such that F(k){\displaystyle F(k)} is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some moduli space around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree d{\displaystyle d} in Pn{\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{n}}, then we could consider the functor
One can go further with the case of genus g > 1, using Serre duality to relate theH1 to
In fact, Milnor studied such deformations, where a singularity is deformed by a constant, hence the fiber over a non-zero s{\displaystyle s} is called the Milnor fiber.
It should be clear there could be many deformations of a single germ of analytic functions. Because of this, there are some book-keeping devices required to organize all of this information. These organizational devices are constructed using tangent cohomology.[1] This is formed by using the Koszul–Tate resolution, and potentially modifying it by adding additional generators for non-regular algebras A{\displaystyle A}. In the case of analytic algebras these resolutions are called the Tjurina resolution for the mathematician who first studied such objects, Galina Tyurina. This is a graded-commutative differential graded algebra (R∙,s){\displaystyle (R_{\bullet },s)} such that R0→A{\displaystyle R_{0}\to A} is a surjective map of analytic algebras, and this map fits into an exact sequence

If a pure spinor that determines a particular complex structure is closed, or more generally if its exterior derivative is equal to the action of a gamma matrix on itself, then the almost complex structure is integrable and so such pure spinors correspond to generalized complex structures.
(n, 0)-forms are pure spinors, as they are annihilated by antiholomorphic tangent vectors and by holomorphic one-forms. Thus this line bundle can be used as a canonical bundle to define a generalized complex structure. Restricting the annihilator from (T⊕T∗)⊗C{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} } to the complexified tangent bundle one gets the subspace of antiholomorphic vector fields. Therefore, this generalized complex structure on (T⊕T∗)⊗C{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} } defines an ordinary complex structure on the tangent bundle.

In generalized complex geometry one is not interested in vector fields, but rather in the formal sums of vector fields and one-forms. A kind of Lie bracket for such formal sums was introduced in 1990 and is called the Courant bracket which is defined by
These structures first arose in Hitchin's program of characterizing geometrical structures via functionals of differential forms, a connection which formed the basis of Robbert Dijkgraaf, Sergei Gukov, Andrew Neitzke and Cumrun Vafa's 2004 proposal that topological string theories are special cases of a topological M-theory. Today generalized complex structures also play a leading role in physical string theory, as supersymmetric flux compactifications, which relate 10-dimensional physics to 4-dimensional worlds like ours, require (possibly twisted) generalized complex structures.

As only half of a basis of vector fields are holomorphic, these complex structures are of type N. In fact complex manifolds, and the manifolds obtained by multiplying the pure spinor bundle defining a complex manifold by a complex, ∂{\displaystyle \partial }-closed (2,0)-form, are the only type N generalized complex manifolds.
for a nondegenerate two-form ω defines a symplectic structure on the tangent space. Thus symplectic manifolds are also generalized complex manifolds.
The above pure spinor is globally defined, and so the canonical bundle is trivial. This means that symplectic manifolds are not only generalized complex manifolds but in fact are generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds.

If one further imposes that the canonical bundle is holomorphically trivial, meaning that it is global sections which are closed forms, then it defines a generalized Calabi-Yau structure and M is said to be a generalized Calabi-Yau manifold.
and so L(E,ε){\displaystyle L(\mathbf {E} ,\varepsilon )} is isotropic. Furthermore, L(E,ε){\displaystyle L(\mathbf {E} ,\varepsilon )} is maximal because there are dim⁡(E){\displaystyle \dim(\mathbf {E} )} (complex) dimensions of choices for E,{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ,} and ε{\displaystyle \varepsilon } is unrestricted on the complement of E∗,{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ^{*},} which is of (complex) dimension n−dim⁡(E).{\displaystyle n-\dim(\mathbf {E} ).} Thus the total (complex) dimension in n.

Some of the almost structures in generalized complex geometry may be rephrased in the language of G-structures. The word "almost" is removed if the structure is integrable.
for some subbundle Δ. A point which has an open neighborhood in which the dimension of the fibers of Δ is constant is said to be a regular point.
A generalized almost complex structure is just an almost complex structure of the generalized tangent bundle which preserves the natural inner product:
As in the case of ordinary complex geometry, there is a correspondence between generalized almost complex structures and complex line bundles. The complex line bundle corresponding to a particular generalized almost complex structure is often referred to as the canonical bundle, as it generalizes the canonical bundle in the ordinary case. It is sometimes also called the pure spinor bundle, as its sections are pure spinors.
Locally all pure spinors can be written in the same form, depending on an integer k, the B-field 2-form B, a nondegenerate symplectic form ω and a k-form Ω. In a local neighborhood of any point a pure spinor Φ which generates the canonical bundle may always be put in the form
Near non-regular points, the above classification theorem does not apply. However, about any point, a generalized complex manifold is, up to diffeomorphism and B-field, a product of a symplectic manifold with a generalized complex manifold which is of complex type at the point, much like Weinstein's theorem for the local structure of Poisson manifolds. The remaining question of the local structure is: what does a generalized complex structure look like near a point of complex type? In fact, it will be induced by a holomorphic Poisson structure.
The canonical bundle is a one complex dimensional subbundle of the bundle Λ∗T⊗C{\displaystyle \mathbf {\Lambda } ^{*}\mathbf {T} \otimes \mathbb {C} } of complex differential forms on M. Recall that the gamma matrices define an isomorphism between differential forms and spinors. In particular even and odd forms map to the two chiralities of Weyl spinors. Vectors have an action on differential forms given by the interior product. One-forms have an action on forms given by the wedge product. Thus sections of the bundle (T⊕T∗)⊗C{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} } act on differential forms. This action is a representation of the action of the Clifford algebra on spinors.

The space of complex differential forms Λ∗T⊗C{\displaystyle \mathbf {\Lambda } ^{*}\mathbf {T} \otimes \mathbb {C} } has a complex conjugation operation given by complex conjugation in C.{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} .} This allows one to define holomorphic and antiholomorphic one-forms and (m, n)-forms, which are homogeneous polynomials in these one-forms with m holomorphic factors and n antiholomorphic factors. In particular, all (n, 0)-forms are related locally by multiplication by a complex function and so they form a complex line bundle.
The type of a generalized almost complex structure is in general not constant, it can jump by any even integer. However it is upper semi-continuous, which means that each point has an open neighborhood in which the type does not increase. In practice this means that subsets of greater type than the ambient type occur on submanifolds with positive codimension.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal isotropic subbundle of T⊕T∗{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*}} and pairs (E,ε){\displaystyle (\mathbf {E} ,\varepsilon )} where E is a subbundle of T and ε{\displaystyle \varepsilon } is a 2-form. This correspondence extends straightforwardly to the complex case.

Notice that a generalized Calabi metric structure, which was introduced by Marco Gualtieri, is a stronger condition than a generalized Calabi–Yau structure, which was introduced by Nigel Hitchin. In particular a generalized Calabi–Yau metric structure implies the existence of two commuting generalized almost complex structures.
Consider an N-manifold M. The tangent bundle of M, which will be denoted T, is the vector bundle over M whose fibers consist of all tangent vectors to M. A section of T is a vector field on M. The cotangent bundle of M, denoted T*, is the vector bundle over M whose sections are one-forms on M.
In the field of mathematics known as differential geometry, a generalized complex structure is a property of a differential manifold that includes as special cases a complex structure and a symplectic structure. Generalized complex structures were introduced by Nigel Hitchin in 2002 and further developed by his students Marco Gualtieri and Gil Cavalcanti.

A spinor is said to be a pure spinor if it is annihilated by half of a set of a set of generators of the Clifford algebra. Spinors are sections of our bundle Λ∗T,{\displaystyle \mathbf {\Lambda } ^{*}\mathbf {T} ,} and generators of the Clifford algebra are the fibers of our other bundle (T⊕T∗)⊗C.{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} .} Therefore, a given pure spinor is annihilated by a half-dimensional subbundle E of (T⊕T∗)⊗C.{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} .} Such subbundles are always isotropic, so to define an almost complex structure one must only impose that the sum of E and its complex conjugate is all of (T⊕T∗)⊗C.{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} .} This is true whenever the wedge product of the pure spinor and its complex conjugate contains a top-dimensional component. Such pure spinors determine generalized almost complex structures.

Up to a shift of the B-field, which corresponds to multiplying the pure spinor by the exponential of a closed, real 2-form, symplectic manifolds are the only type 0 generalized complex manifolds. Manifolds which are symplectic up to a shift of the B-field are sometimes called B-symplectic.
The bundle (T⊕T∗)⊗C{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} } with the above inner product is an O(2n, 2n) structure. A generalized almost complex structure is a reduction of this structure to a U(n, n) structure. Therefore, the space of generalized complex structures is the coset
A generalized almost Kähler structure is a pair of commuting generalized complex structures such that minus the product of the corresponding tensors is a positive definite metric on (T⊕T∗)⊗C.{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} .} Generalized Kähler structures are reductions of the structure group to U(n)×U(n).{\displaystyle U(n)\times U(n).} Generalized Kähler manifolds, and their twisted counterparts, are equivalent to the bihermitian manifolds discovered by Sylvester James Gates, Chris Hull and Martin Roček in the context of 2-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories in 1984.
Given a generalized almost complex structure, one can also determine a pure spinor up to multiplication by an arbitrary complex function. These choices of pure spinors are defined to be the sections of the canonical bundle.

In ordinary complex geometry, an almost complex structure is integrable to a complex structure if and only if the Lie bracket of two sections of the holomorphic subbundle is another section of the holomorphic subbundle.

In complex geometry one considers structures on the tangent bundles of manifolds. In symplectic geometry one is instead interested in exterior powers of the cotangent bundle. Generalized geometry unites these two fields by treating sections of the generalized tangent bundle, which is the direct sum T⊕T∗{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*}} of the tangent and cotangent bundles, which are formal sums of a vector field and a one-form.

The type of a maximal isotropic subbundle L(E,ε){\displaystyle L(\mathbf {E} ,\varepsilon )} is the real dimension of the subbundle that annihilates E. Equivalently it is 2N minus the real dimension of the projection of L(E,ε){\displaystyle L(\mathbf {E} ,\varepsilon )} onto the tangent bundle T. In other words, the type of a maximal isotropic subbundle is the codimension of its projection onto the tangent bundle. In the complex case one uses the complex dimension and the type is sometimes referred to as the complex type. While the type of a subbundle can in principle be any integer between 0 and 2N, generalized almost complex structures cannot have a type greater than N because the sum of the subbundle and its complex conjugate must be all of (T⊕T∗)⊗C.{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} .}
To see that L(E,ε){\displaystyle L(\mathbf {E} ,\varepsilon )} is isotropic, notice that if Y is a section of E and ξ{\displaystyle \xi } restricted to E∗{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ^{*}} is ε(X){\displaystyle \varepsilon (X)} then ξ(Y)=ε(X,Y),{\displaystyle \xi (Y)=\varepsilon (X,Y),} as the part of ξ{\displaystyle \xi } orthogonal to E∗{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ^{*}} annihilates Y. Thesefore if X+ξ{\displaystyle X+\xi } and Y+η{\displaystyle Y+\eta } are sections of T⊕T∗{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*}} then
The real index r of a maximal isotropic subspace L is the complex dimension of the intersection of L with its complex conjugate. A maximal isotropic subspace of (T⊕T∗)⊗C{\displaystyle (\mathbf {T} \oplus \mathbf {T} ^{*})\otimes \mathbb {C} } is a generalized almost complex structure if and only if r = 0.
The pure spinor ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is related to a pure spinor which is just a number by an imaginary shift of the B-field, which is a shift of the Kähler form. Therefore, these generalized complex structures are of the same type as those corresponding to a scalar pure spinor. A scalar is annihilated by the entire tangent space, and so these structures are of type 0.

In mathematics, a reality structure on a complex vector space V is a decomposition of V into two real subspaces, called the real and imaginary parts of V:

In the presence of a reality structure, every vector in V has a real part and an imaginary part, each of which is a vector in VR:
Naturally, one would wish to represent V as the direct sum of two real vector spaces, the "real and imaginary parts of V". There is no canonical way of doing this: such a splitting is an additional real structure in V. It may be introduced as follows.[1] Let σ:V→V{\displaystyle \sigma :V\to V\,} be an antilinear map such that σ∘σ=idV{\displaystyle \sigma \circ \sigma =id_{V}\,}, that is an antilinear involution of the complex space V. Any vector v∈V{\displaystyle v\in V\,} can be written v=v++v−{\displaystyle {v=v^{+}+v^{-}}\,}, where v+=12(v+σv){\displaystyle v^{+}={1 \over {2}}(v+\sigma v)} and v−=12(v−σv){\displaystyle v^{-}={1 \over {2}}(v-\sigma v)\,}.

Therefore, one gets a direct sum of vector spaces V=V+⊕V−{\displaystyle V=V^{+}\oplus V^{-}\,} where:
For an algebraic variety defined over a subfield of the real numbers,the real structure is the complex conjugation acting on the points of the variety in complex projective or affine space.Its fixed locus is the space of real points of the variety (which may be empty).
It follows a natural linear isomorphism VR⊗RC→V{\displaystyle V_{\mathbb {R} }\otimes _{\mathbb {R} }\mathbb {C} \to V\,} between complex vector spaces with a given real structure.

One first notes that every complex space V has a realification obtained by taking the same vectors as in the original set and restricting the scalars to be real. If t∈V{\displaystyle t\in V\,} and t≠0{\displaystyle t\neq 0} then the vectors t{\displaystyle t\,} and it{\displaystyle it\,} are linearly independent in the realification of V. Hence:
Here VR is a real subspace of V, i.e. a subspace of V considered as a vector space over the real numbers.If V has complex dimension n (real dimension 2n), then VR must have real dimension n.
This is actually the decomposition of V as the eigenspaces of the real linear operator c.The eigenvalues of c are +1 and −1, with eigenspaces VR and i{\displaystyle i} VR, respectively.Typically, the operator c itself, rather than the eigenspace decomposition it entails, is referred to as the reality structure on V.

Suppose M is equipped with a symplectic form ω, a Riemannian metric g, and an almost complex structure J. Since ω and g are nondegenerate, each induces a bundle isomorphism TM → T*M, where the first map, denoted φω, is given by the interior product φω(u) = iuω = ω(u, •) and the other, denoted φg, is given by the analogous operation for g. With this understood, the three structures (g, ω, J) form a compatible triple when each structure can be specified by the two others as follows:
so that ∂{\displaystyle \partial } is a map which increases the holomorphic part of the type by one (takes forms of type (p, q) to forms of type (p+1, q)), and ∂¯{\displaystyle {\overline {\partial }}} is a map which increases the antiholomorphic part of the type by one. These operators are called the Dolbeault operators.
The converse question, whether the almost complex structure implies the existence of a complex structure is much less trivial, and not true in general. On an arbitrary almost complex manifold one can always find coordinates for which the almost complex structure takes the above canonical form at any given point p. In general, however, it is not possible to find coordinates so that J takes the canonical form on an entire neighborhood of p. Such coordinates, if they exist, are called 'local holomorphic coordinates for J'. If M admits local holomorphic coordinates for J around every point then these patch together to form a holomorphic atlas for M giving it a complex structure, which moreover induces J. J is then said to be 'integrable'. If J is induced by a complex structure, then it is induced by a unique complex structure.
There are several other criteria which are equivalent to the vanishing of the Nijenhuis tensor, and which therefore furnish methods for checking the integrability of an almost complex structure (and in fact each of these can be found in the literature):
J∂∂xμ=∂∂yμJ∂∂yμ=−∂∂xμ{\displaystyle J{\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{\mu }}}={\frac {\partial }{\partial y^{\mu }}}\qquad J{\frac {\partial }{\partial y^{\mu }}}=-{\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{\mu }}}}
"On the Chern numbers of certain complex and almost complex manifolds"
The Newlander–Nirenberg theorem states that an almost complex structure J is integrable if and only if NJ = 0. The compatible complex structure is unique, as discussed above. Since the existence of an integrable almost complex structure is equivalent to the existence of a complex structure, this is sometimes taken as the definition of a complex structure.
J∂∂zμ=i∂∂zμJ∂∂z¯μ=−i∂∂z¯μ.{\displaystyle J{\frac {\partial }{\partial z^{\mu }}}=i{\frac {\partial }{\partial z^{\mu }}}\qquad J{\frac {\partial }{\partial {\bar {z}}^{\mu }}}=-i{\frac {\partial }{\partial {\bar {z}}^{\mu }}}.}
Given any linear map A on each tangent space of M; i.e., A is a tensor field of rank (1, 1), then the Nijenhuis tensor is a tensor field of rank (1,2) given by
An almost complex structure integrates to a complex structure if the half-dimensional subspace is closed under the Lie bracket. A generalized almost complex structure integrates to a generalized complex structure if the subspace is closed under the Courant bracket. If furthermore this half-dimensional space is the annihilator of a nowhere vanishing pure spinor then M is a generalized Calabi–Yau manifold.
In each of these equations, the two structures on the right hand side are called compatible when the corresponding construction yields a structure of the type specified. For example, ω and J are compatible if and only if ω(•, J•) is a Riemannian metric. The bundle on M whose sections are the almost complex structures compatible to ω has contractible fibres: the complex structures on the tangent fibres compatible with the restriction to the symplectic forms.

Let M be a smooth manifold. An almost complex structure J on M is a linear complex structure (that is, a linear map which squares to −1) on each tangent space of the manifold, which varies smoothly on the manifold. In other words, we have a smooth tensor field J of degree (1, 1) such that J2=−1{\displaystyle J^{2}=-1} when regarded as a vector bundle isomorphism J:TM→TM{\displaystyle J\colon TM\to TM} on the tangent bundle. A manifold equipped with an almost complex structure is called an almost complex manifold.
The individual expressions on the right depend on the choice of the smooth vector fields X and Y, but the left side actually depends only on the pointwise values of X and Y, which is why NA is a tensor. This is also clear from the component formula
These triples are related to the 2 out of 3 property of the unitary group.
Just as we build differential forms out of exterior powers of the cotangent bundle, we can build exterior powers of the complexified cotangent bundle (which is canonically isomorphic to the bundle of dual spaces of the complexified tangent bundle). The almost complex structure induces the decomposition of each space of r-forms
Just as a complex structure on a vector space V allows a decomposition of VC into V+ and V− (the eigenspaces of J corresponding to +i and −i, respectively), so an almost complex structure on M allows a decomposition of the complexified tangent bundle TMC (which is the vector bundle of complexified tangent spaces at each point) into TM+ and TM−. A section of TM+ is called a vector field of type (1, 0), while a section of TM− is a vector field of type (0, 1). Thus J corresponds to multiplication by i on the (1, 0)-vector fields of the complexified tangent bundle, and multiplication by −i on the (0, 1)-vector fields.
For every integer n, the flat space R2n admits an almost complex structure. An example for such an almost complex structure is (1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2n): Jij=−δi,j−1{\displaystyle J_{ij}=-\delta _{i,j-1}} for even i, Jij=δi,j+1{\displaystyle J_{ij}=\delta _{i,j+1}} for odd i.

Every complex manifold is itself an almost complex manifold. In local holomorphic coordinates zμ=xμ+iyμ{\displaystyle z^{\mu }=x^{\mu }+iy^{\mu }} one can define the maps
Using elementary properties of the symplectic form ω, one can show that a compatible almost complex structure J is an almost Kähler structure for the Riemannian metric ω(u, Jv). Also, if J is integrable, then (M, ω, J) is a Kähler manifold.

The existence of an almost complex structure is a topological question and is relatively easy to answer, as discussed above. The existence of an integrable almost complex structure, on the other hand, is a much more difficult analytic question. For example, it is still not known whether S6 admits an integrable almost complex structure, despite a long history of ultimately unverified claims. Smoothness issues are important. For real-analytic J, the Newlander–Nirenberg theorem follows from the Frobenius theorem; for C∞ (and less smooth) J, analysis is required (with more difficult techniques as the regularity hypothesis weakens).
An easy exercise in linear algebra shows that any even dimensional vector space admits a linear complex structure. Therefore, an even dimensional manifold always admits a (1, 1)-rank tensor pointwise (which is just a linear transformation on each tangent space) such that Jp2 = −1 at each point p. Only when this local tensor can be patched together to be defined globally does the pointwise linear complex structure yield an almost complex structure, which is then uniquely determined. The possibility of this patching, and therefore existence of an almost complex structure on a manifold M is equivalent to a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle from GL(2n, R) to GL(n, C). The existence question is then a purely algebraic topological one and is fairly well understood.

As with any direct sum, there is a canonical projection πp,q from Ωr(M)C to Ω(p,q). We also have the exterior derivative d which maps Ωr(M)C to Ωr+1(M)C. Thus we may use the almost complex structure to refine the action of the exterior derivative to the forms of definite type

The concept is due to Charles Ehresmann and Heinz Hopf in the 1940s.[1]
Nigel Hitchin introduced the notion of a generalized almost complex structure on the manifold M, which was elaborated in the doctoral dissertations of his students Marco Gualtieri and Gil Cavalcanti. An ordinary almost complex structure is a choice of a half-dimensional subspace of each fiber of the complexified tangent bundle TM. A generalized almost complex structure is a choice of a half-dimensional isotropic subspace of each fiber of the direct sum of the complexified tangent and cotangent bundles. In both cases one demands that the direct sum of the subbundle and its complex conjugate yield the original bundle.
If M admits an almost complex structure, it must be even-dimensional. This can be seen as follows. Suppose M is n-dimensional, and let J : TM → TM be an almost complex structure. If J2 = −1 then (det J)2 = (−1)n. But if M is a real manifold, then det J is a real number – thus n must be even if M has an almost complex structure. One can show that it must be orientable as well.
The only spheres which admit almost complex structures are S2 and S6 (Borel & Serre (1953)). In particular, S4 cannot be given an almost complex structure (Ehresmann and Hopf). In the case of S2, the almost complex structure comes from an honest complex structure on the Riemann sphere. The 6-sphere, S6, when considered as the set of unit norm imaginary octonions, inherits an almost complex structure from the octonion multiplication; the question of whether it has a complex structure is known as the Hopf problem, after Heinz Hopf.[2]
Any of these conditions implies the existence of a unique compatible complex structure.

In terms of the Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket, which generalizes the Lie bracket of vector fields, the Nijenhuis tensor NA is just one-half of [A, A].
In other words, each Ωr(M)C admits a decomposition into a sum of Ω(p, q)(M), with r = p + q.
One easily checks that this map defines an almost complex structure. Thus any complex structure on a manifold yields an almost complex structure, which is said to be 'induced' by the complex structure, and the complex structure is said to be 'compatible with' the almost complex structure.
In mathematics, an almost complex manifold is a smooth manifold equipped with a smooth linear complex structure on each tangent space. Every complex manifold is an almost complex manifold, but there are almost complex manifolds that are not complex manifolds. Almost complex structures have important applications in symplectic geometry.
An almost complex structure is weaker than a complex structure: any complex manifold has an almost complex structure, but not every almost complex structure comes from a complex structure. Note that every even-dimensional real manifold has an almost complex structure defined locally from the local coordinate chart. The question is whether this complex structure can be defined globally. An almost complex structure that comes from a complex structure is called integrable, and when one wishes to specify a complex structure as opposed to an almost complex structure, one says an integrable complex structure. For integrable complex structures the so-called Nijenhuis tensor vanishes. This tensor is defined on pairs of vector fields, X, Y by
In differential geometry and complex geometry, a complex manifold is a manifold with an atlas of charts to the open unit disc[1] in Cn{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}, such that the transition maps are holomorphic.
For example, the Whitney embedding theorem tells us that every smooth n-dimensional manifold can be embedded as a smooth submanifold of R2n, whereas it is "rare" for a complex manifold to have a holomorphic embedding into Cn. Consider for example any compact connected complex manifold M: any holomorphic function on it is constant by the maximum modulus principle. Now if we had a holomorphic embedding of M into Cn, then the coordinate functions of Cn would restrict to nonconstant holomorphic functions on M, contradicting compactness, except in the case that M is just a point. Complex manifolds that can be embedded in Cn are called Stein manifolds and form a very special class of manifolds including, for example, smooth complex affine algebraic varieties.
Since the transition maps between charts are biholomorphic, complex manifolds are, in particular, smooth and canonically oriented (not just orientable: a biholomorphic map to (a subset of) Cn gives an orientation, as biholomorphic maps are orientation-preserving).
{z=(z1,…,zn)∈Cn:|zj|<1 ∀j=1,…,n}.{\displaystyle \left\{z=(z_{1},\dots ,z_{n})\in \mathbb {C} ^{n}:\vert z_{j}\vert <1\ \forall j=1,\dots ,n\right\}.}
The simply connected 1-dimensional complex manifolds are isomorphic to either:
Since holomorphic functions are much more rigid than smooth functions, the theories of smooth and complex manifolds have very different flavors: compact complex manifolds are much closer to algebraic varieties than to differentiable manifolds.

Complex Lie groups such as GL(n, C) or Sp(n, C).
Examples of Kähler manifolds include smooth projective varieties and more generally any complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold. The Hopf manifolds are examples of complex manifolds that are not Kähler. To construct one, take a complex vector space minus the origin and consider the action of the group of integers on this space by multiplication by exp(n). The quotient is a complex manifold whose first Betti number is one, so by the Hodge theory, it cannot be Kähler.
Similarly, the quaternionic analogs of these are also complex manifolds.

An almost complex structure on a real 2n-manifold is a GL(n, C)-structure (in the sense of G-structures) – that is, the tangent bundle is equipped with a linear complex structure.
^ This means that all complex projective spaces are orientable, in contrast to the real case
Tensoring the tangent bundle with the complex numbers we get the complexified tangent bundle, on which multiplication by complex numbers makes sense (even if we started with a real manifold). The eigenvalues of an almost complex structure are ±i and the eigenspaces form sub-bundles denoted by T0,1M and T1,0M. The Newlander–Nirenberg theorem shows that an almost complex structure is actually a complex structure precisely when these subbundles are involutive, i.e., closed under the Lie bracket of vector fields, and such an almost complex structure is called integrable.
This means that all complex projective spaces are orientable, in contrast to the real case
The term complex manifold is variously used to mean a complex manifold in the sense above (which can be specified as an integrable complex manifold), and an almost complex manifold.

The classification of complex manifolds is much more subtle than that of differentiable manifolds. For example, while in dimensions other than four, a given topological manifold has at most finitely many smooth structures, a topological manifold supporting a complex structure can and often does support uncountably many complex structures. Riemann surfaces, two dimensional manifolds equipped with a complex structure, which are topologically classified by the genus, are an important example of this phenomenon. The set of complex structures on a given orientable surface, modulo biholomorphic equivalence, itself forms a complex algebraic variety called a moduli space, the structure of which remains an area of active research.

^ One must use the open unit disc in Cn{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} as the model space instead of Cn{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} because these are not isomorphic, unlike for real manifolds.
Note that there are inclusions between these asΔ ⊆ C ⊆ Ĉ, but that there are no non-constant maps in the other direction, byLiouville's theorem.
The following spaces are different as complex manifolds, demonstrating the more rigid geometric character of complex manifolds (compared to smooth manifolds):
Concretely, this is an endomorphism of the tangent bundle whose square is −I; this endomorphism is analogous to multiplication by the imaginary number i, and is denoted J (to avoid confusion with the identity matrix I). An almost complex manifold is necessarily even-dimensional.
One can define an analogue of a Riemannian metric for complex manifolds, called a Hermitian metric. Like a Riemannian metric, a Hermitian metric consists of a smoothly varying, positive definite inner product on the tangent bundle, which is Hermitian with respect to the complex structure on the tangent space at each point. As in the Riemannian case, such metrics always exist in abundance on any complex manifold. If the skew symmetric part of such a metric is symplectic, i.e. closed and nondegenerate, then the metric is called Kähler. Kähler structures are much more difficult to come by and are much more rigid.

For example, the 6-dimensional sphere S6 has a natural almost complex structure arising from the fact that it is the orthogonal complement of i in the unit sphere of the octonions, but this is not a complex structure. (The question of whether it has a complex structure is known as the Hopf problem, after Heinz Hopf.[3]) Using an almost complex structure we can make sense of holomorphic maps and ask about the existence of holomorphic coordinates on the manifold. The existence of holomorphic coordinates is equivalent to saying the manifold is complex (which is what the chart definition says).
See complex differential form and almost complex manifold for applications of these ideas.

A real linear transformation A : V → V is a complex linear transformation of the corresponding complex space VJ if and only if A commutes with J, i.e. if and only if
If J is a complex structure on V, we may extend J by linearity to VC:
Given any real vector space V we may define its complexification by extension of scalars:
The space of (p,q)-forms Λp,q VJ*is the space of (complex) multilinear forms on VC which vanish on homogeneous elements unless p are from V+ and q are from V−. It is also possible to regard Λp,q VJ* as the space of real multilinear maps from VJ to C which are complex linear in p terms and conjugate-linear in q terms.

Going in the other direction, if one starts with a complex vector space W then one can define a complex structure on the underlying real space by defining Jw = iw for all w ∈ W.
Given a symplectic form ω and a linear complex structure J on V, one may define an associated bilinear form gJ on V by
If B is a bilinear form on V then we say that J preserves B if
The fundamental example of a linear complex structure is the structure on R2n coming from the complex structure on Cn. That is, the complex n-dimensional space Cn is also a real 2n-dimensional space – using the same vector addition and real scalar multiplication – while multiplication by the complex number i is not only a complex linear transform of the space, thought of as a complex vector space, but also a real linear transform of the space, thought of as a real vector space. Concretely, this is because scalar multiplication by i commutes with scalar multiplication by real numbersi(λv)=(iλ)v=(λi)v=λ(iv){\displaystyle i(\lambda v)=(i\lambda )v=(\lambda i)v=\lambda (iv)} – and distributes across vector addition. As a complex n×n matrix, this is simply the scalar matrix with i on the diagonal. The corresponding real 2n×2n matrix is denoted J.

Note that if VJ has complex dimension n then both V+ and V− have complex dimension n while VC has complex dimension 2n.
There is a natural complex linear isomorphism between VJ and V+, so these vector spaces can be considered the same, while V− may be regarded as the complex conjugate of VJ.
Let V be a real vector space with a complex structure J. The dual space V* has a natural complex structure J* given by the dual (or transpose) of J. The complexification of the dual space (V*)C therefore has a natural decomposition
Every complex vector space can be equipped with a compatible complex structure, however, there is in general no canonical such structure. Complex structures have applications in representation theory as well as in complex geometry where they play an essential role in the definition of almost complex manifolds, by contrast to complex manifolds.The term "complex structure" often refers to this structure on manifolds; when it refers instead to a structure on vector spaces, it may be called a linear complex structure.
The collection of 2x2 real matrices M(2,R) over the real field is 4-dimensional. Any matrix

into the ±i eigenspaces of J*. Under the natural identification of (V*)C with (VC)* one can characterize (V*)+ as those complex linear functionals which vanish on V−. Likewise (V*)− consists of those complex linear functionals which vanish on V+.
The (complex) tensor, symmetric, and exterior algebras over VC also admit decompositions. The exterior algebra is perhaps the most important application of this decomposition. In general, if a vector space U admits a decomposition U = S ⊕ T then the exterior powers of U can be decomposed as follows:
The data of the real vector space and the J matrix is exactly the same as the data of the complex vector space, as the J matrix allows one to define complex multiplication. At the level of Lie algebras and Lie groups, this corresponds to the inclusion of gl(n,C) in gl(2n,R) (Lie algebras – matrices, not necessarily invertible) and GL(n,C) in GL(2n,R):
If VJ has complex dimension n then V must have real dimension 2n. That is, a finite-dimensional space V admits a complex structure only if it is even-dimensional. It is not hard to see that every even-dimensional vector space admits a complex structure. One can define J on pairs e,f of basis vectors by Je = f and Jf = −e and then extend by linearity to all of V. If (v1, …, vn) is a basis for the complex vector space VJ then (v1, Jv1, …, vn, Jvn) is a basis for the underlying real space V.

All exterior powers are taken over the complex numbers. So if VJ has complex dimension n (real dimension 2n) then
dimC⁡ΛrVC=(2nr)dimC⁡Λp,qVJ=(np)(nq).{\displaystyle \dim _{\mathbb {C} }\Lambda ^{r}\,V^{\mathbb {C} }={2n \choose r}\qquad \dim _{\mathbb {C} }\Lambda ^{p,q}\,V_{J}={n \choose p}{n \choose q}.}
This is a complex vector space whose complex dimension is equal to the real dimension of V. It has a canonical complex conjugation defined by
A complex structure J on V therefore induces a decomposition
The inclusion corresponds to forgetting the complex structure (and keeping only the real), while the subgroup GL(n,C) can be characterized (given in equations) as the matrices that commute with J:
More formally, a linear complex structure on a real vector space is an algebra representation of the complex numbers C, thought of as an associative algebra over the real numbers. This algebra is realized concretely as

Abstractly, if one starts with a complex vector space W and takes the complexification of the underlying real space, one obtains a space isomorphic to the direct sum of W and its conjugate:
If V is any real vector space there is a canonical complex structure on the direct sum V ⊕ V given by
Note that the defining equations for these statements are the same, as AJ=JA{\displaystyle AJ=JA} is the same as AJ−JA=0,{\displaystyle AJ-JA=0,} which is the same as [A,J]=0,{\displaystyle [A,J]=0,} though the meaning of the Lie bracket vanishing is less immediate geometrically than the meaning of commuting.
If g is an inner product on V then J preserves g if and only if J is an orthogonal transformation. Likewise, J preserves a nondegenerate, skew-symmetric form ω if and only if J is a symplectic transformation (that is, if ω(Ju,Jv)=ω(u,v){\textstyle \omega (Ju,Jv)=\omega (u,v)}). For symplectic forms ω an interesting compatibility condition between J and ω is that
On the other hand, if one orders the basis as {e1,e2,…,en,ie1,ie2,…,ien}{\displaystyle \left\{e_{1},e_{2},\dots ,e_{n},ie_{1},ie_{2},\dots ,ie_{n}\right\}}, then the matrix for J is block-antidiagonal:
The dimensions add up correctly as a consequence of Vandermonde's identity.
A complex structure on a real vector space V is a real linear transformation
If one orders the basis as {e1,ie1,e2,ie2,…,en,ien},{\displaystyle \left\{e_{1},ie_{1},e_{2},ie_{2},\dots ,e_{n},ie_{n}\right\},} then the matrix for J takes the block diagonal form (subscripts added to indicate dimension):
In mathematics, a complex structure on a real vector space V is an automorphism of V that squares to the minus identity, −I. Such a structure on V allows one to define multiplication by complex scalars in a canonical fashion so as to regard V as a complex vector space.
Since C is algebraically closed, J is guaranteed to have eigenvalues which satisfy λ2 = −1, namely λ = ±i.Thus we may write
