"I wanted to treat this like a debut record. The band’s still called White Denim and it is because that’s what we’re calling it, essentially, but I definitely felt like we needed to go back-to-basics. It was like we write the tunes, rehearse them for a week or two weeks – we didn’t do a lot pre-production – then just bang it out. It was the first time to go in with a producer from the beginning of a record and finish with a producer as well."

Stiff was released on March 25, 2016, on Downtown Records. Mark Demig, who reviewed the album for AllMusic said "The edgy energy that's long been the band's trademark is present in abundance here, which is welcome news since Stiff debuts a new White Denim lineup." and added that "The tone here is frequently playful, especially when Petralli lets his blue-eyed soul accents come forth. But the attack is taut and the force of this music is no joke."[6] NME give the album three out of five stars, concluding "[The group] wear their virtuosity proudly and with each album their brand of bluesy, Southern-style boogie-woogie becomes less obscured by experimentation, although whether or not that’s a good thing is a moot point. This is certainly the kind of music punk had to be invented for."[7] The Guardian awarded Stiff four out of five stars, praising the soul influence on the songwriting – "Live, they may make your knees shake like Robert Plant, but on record the musicianship often eclipses the songs, resulting in a lack of truly memorable bangers. [Corsicana Lemonade] went some way towards changing that, but on their seventh, the Ethan Johns-produced Stiff, they’ve nailed it by embracing soul – or rather, running into its syrupy-sweet waters."[10]

A 2008 small (n=3) single-blind, placebo-controlled study where participating patients were treated with oral LEV of 500 mg twice daily. The study noted that showed that the patients had improvement in axial rigidity and disappearance of the paroxysmal respiratory arrests within three days after starting therapy. A similar improvement was noted in the other two patients with a marked reduction in legs' stiffness and difficulty walking. On LEV treatment, all patients improved as assessed by all outcome measures. In particular, at EMG recordings, patients relaxed their musculature better.[36][37] However, no long-term studies on LEV on patients with SPS have been done.
Opiates are sometimes used to treat severe pain, but they may exacerbate symptoms.[48][49]
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with high intensity conditioning protocol has been performed in a few cases with severe anti-GAD positive SPS, resulting in clinical remission.[50][51] In carefully selected cases of severe, treatment refractory SPS, HSCT may be an effective therapeutic option.[52]

Plasma exchange, or plasmapheresis, has been shown to benefit patients who do not respond to first-line therapy, specifically beneficial for patients with anti-GAD65 positive SPS.[31]
A 2020 review article by Ortiz, Ghani, Cox, and Tambo, noted a case report, where a SPS patient reporting persistent, severe symptoms and taking high-dose benzodiazepines, baclofen, corticosteroids, LEV, IVIG, and IV ethanol.After that, the patient received a small dose of propofol, which improved the patient's reported symptoms. Additionally, the authors documented a patient with stiff-limb syndrome (a variant of SPS) with refractory therapy who also responded well to propofol.[36][38]

Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, is generally used when individuals taking high doses of benzodiazepines have high side effects. In some cases, it has shown improvements in electrophysiological and muscle stiffness when administered intravenously.[34] Intrathecal baclofen administration may not have long-term benefits though, and there are potential serious side effects.[7]

Patients with SPS generally have high glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody levels in their blood.[21] About 80 percent of SPS patients have GAD antibodies, compared with about one percent of the general population.[22] The overwhelming majority of people who have GAD antibodies do not develop SPS, indicating that systemic synthesis of the antibody is not the sole cause of SPS.[23] GAD, a presynaptic autoantigen, is generally thought to play a key role in the condition, but exact details of the way that autoantibodies affect SPS patients are not known.[24] Most SPS patients with high-titer GAD antibodies also have antibodies that inhibit GABA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP).[7] Autoantibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are also sometimes found in SPS patients.[24] The antibodies appear to interact with antigens in the brain neurons and the spinal cord synapses, causing a functional blockade of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).[7] This leads to GABA impairment, which probably causes the stiffness and spasms that characterize SPS.[21] There are low GABA levels in the motor cortexes of SPS patients.

In 1963, it was determined that diazepam helped alleviate symptoms of SPS.[7] Corticosteroids were first used to treat the condition in 1988, and plasma exchange was first applied the following year.[24] The first use of intravenous immunoglobulin to treat the condition came in 1994.[24]

In December 2022, singer Céline Dion announced that she is suffering from this syndrome, resulting in cancelled performances.[62]
SPS was first described in 1956. Diagnostic criteria were proposed in the 1960s and refined two decades later. In the 1990s and 2000s the roles of antibodies in the condition became clearer. SPS patients generally have glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, which seldom occur in the general population. In addition to blood tests for GAD, electromyography tests can help confirm the condition's presence.

Benzodiazepine-class drugs are the most common treatment; they are used for symptom relief from stiffness. Other common treatments include baclofen, intravenous immunoglobin and rituximab. There is a limited but encouraging therapeutic experience of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for SPS.[2]

SPS patients experience superimposed spasms and extreme sensitivity to touch and sound.[7] These spasms primarily occur in the proximal limb and axial muscles.[10] Spasms usually last for minutes and can recur over hours. Attacks of spasms are unpredictable and are often caused by fast movements, emotional distress, or sudden sounds or touches.[8] In rare cases, facial muscles, hands, feet, and the chest can be affected and unusual eye movements and vertigo occur.[11][12] There are brisk stretch reflexes and clonus occurs in patients.[7] Late in the disease's progression, hypnagogic myoclonus can occur.[13]

"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of rituximab in patients with stiff person syndrome"
Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is often separated into several subtypes, based on the cause and progression of the disease.
Botulinum toxin has been used to treat SPS, but it does not appear to have long-term benefits and has potential serious side effects.[7] In paraneoplastic cases, tumors must be managed in order for the condition to be contained.[7]
Rituximab is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, which causes a sustained depletion of B cells and has demonstrated promising results in several autoimmune neurological diseases.[36][40][41][42][43]
In 1988, Solimena et al. discovered that autoantibodies against GAD played a key role in SPS.[56] Two years later, Solimena found the antibodies in 20 out of 33 patients examined.[60] In the late 1980s, it was also demonstrated that the serum of SPS patients would bind to GABAergic neurons.[25] In 2006, the role of GABARAP in SPS was discovered.[24] The first case of paraneoplastic SPS was found in 1975.[61] In 1993, antiamphiphysin was shown to play a role in paraneoplastic SPS,[24] and seven years later antigephyrin was also found to be involved in the condition.[24]

Stiff-person syndrome (SPS), also known as stiff-man syndrome (SMS),[1] is a rare neurologic disorder of unclear cause characterized by progressive rigidity and stiffness. The stiffness primarily affects the truncal muscles and is superimposed by spasms, resulting in postural deformities. Chronic pain, impaired mobility, and lumbar hyperlordosis are common symptoms.[2][3]
It is not known why GAD autoimmunity occurs in SPS patients,[25] and whether SPS qualifies as a neuro-autoimmune disorder has been questioned.[26] It is also unknown whether these antibodies are pathogenic.[25] The level of GAD antibody titers found in SPS patients does not correlate with disease severity,[21] indicating that these titer levels do not need to be monitored.[27] It has not been proven that GAD antibodies are the sole cause of SPS, and the possibility exists that they are a marker or an epiphenomenon of the condition's cause.[28]
There is no evidence-based criterion for treating SPS, and there have been no large, controlled trials of treatments for the condition. The rarity of the disease complicates efforts to establish guidelines.[31] However, treatments can either be categorized as GABAergic or Immuno-Therapy.

Pregabalin works by inhibiting calcium influx and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters, including glutamate and norepinephrine. As a possible mechanism of action in SPS, pregabalin might have compensated for the imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory intracortical circuits. The prolongation of the GABA-B supports this hypothesis-mediated cortical silent period (CSP) after pregabalin introduction.[36]

The same general criteria are used to diagnose paraneoplastic SPS as for the normal form of the condition.[15] Once SPS is diagnosed, poor response to conventional therapies and the presence of cancer indicate that it may be paraneoplastic.[7] CT scans are indicated for SPS patients who respond poorly to therapy to determine if cancer is the cause.[30]

SPS was first described by Moersch and Woltman in 1956. Their description of the disease was based on 14 cases that they had observed over 32 years. Using electromyography, they noted that motor-unit firing suggested that voluntary muscle contractions were occurring in their patients.[56] Previously, cases of SPS had been dismissed as psychogenic problems.[58] Moersch and Woltman initially called the condition "stiff-man syndrome", but the first female patient was confirmed in 1958[10] and a young boy was confirmed to have it in 1960.[59] Clinical diagnostic criteria were developed by Gordon et al. in 1967. They observed "persistent tonic contraction reflected in constant firing, even at rest" after providing patients with muscle relaxants and examining them with electromyography.[56] In 1989, criteria for an SPS diagnosis were adopted that included episodic axial stiffness, progression of stiffness, lordosis, and triggered spasms.[59] The name of the disease was shifted from "stiff-man syndrome" to the gender-neutral "stiff-person syndrome" in 1991.[59]
Patients' fears and phobias often incorrectly lead doctors to think their symptoms are psychogenic,[32] and they are sometimes suspected of malingering.[12] It takes an average of six years after the onset of symptoms before the disease is diagnosed.[32]

A minority of people with SPS experience "partial" SPS, also called "stiff limb syndrome", where the muscle contractions and stiffness are limited to the limbs, or sometimes a single limb.[5] This syndrome develops into full SPS about 25% of the time.[16] The stiffness begins in one limb and remains most prominent there. Sphincter and brainstem issues often occur with stiff-limb syndrome. [17]

Tacrolimus belongs to the same class of medication as cyclosporine (calcineurin inhibitor) but is more potent. Tacrolimus inhibits the activity of T cells by decreasing the levels of IL-2.[44] leading to a reduction of activation of B cells to produce antibodies.[44] A small (n=2) study in 2013 showed that patients treated with tacrolimus and additional immunotherapies, after four weeks, reported improvement in their symptoms and a reduction of antibody titers.[44][36] T helper cells. If the T helper cells can conduct their function, there will be less activation of B cells to produce antibodies.[44][36]

The muscle stiffness initially fluctuates, sometimes for days or weeks, but eventually begins to consistently impair mobility.[7] As the disease progresses, patients sometimes become unable to walk or bend.[8] Chronic pain is common and worsens over time, but sometimes acute pain occurs as well.[9] Stress, cold weather, and infections lead to an increase in symptoms, and sleep decreases them.[7]

SPS is diagnosed by evaluating clinical findings and excluding other conditions.[7] There is no specific laboratory test that confirms its presence.[5] Due to the rarity and varied symptoms of SPS, most affected by the disease wait several years before they are correctly diagnosed.[5]
Benzodiazepines (such as diazepam and clonazepam) are psychoactive drugs that enhance a GABA neurotransmitter's effect at the GABA receptor in enhancing inhibitory circuits. The drug has been used as sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant.[35] Patients with classic or partial SMS and GAD-65-positive antibody have shown improvement in stiffness and spasm symptoms with long-term benzodiazepine treatment. However, this change cannot solely be attributed to monotherapy of benzodiazepine as adjunct medications were also commonly administered. Currently, diazepam is the mainstay of therapy. Most patients respond well to diazepam.[36]
Around 70% of those with SPS have the "classic" form of the disease.[5] People with classic SPS typically first experience intermittent tightness or aching in the muscles of the trunk.[6] These muscles repeatedly and involuntarily contract, causing them to grow and rigidify.[6] Eventually, rigidified muscles reduce the affected person's range of motion, slow their voluntary movements, and may cause them to have abnormal posture, particularly lumbar hyperlordosis (a distinctive curve in the lower back).[6] Rigid trunk muscles can also prevent the chest and abdomen from expanding, causing shortness of breath and early satiety.[6] In many people with SPS, muscle rigidity eventually progresses from the trunk to the limbs – first affecting muscles closest to the trunk, then further.[6] Stiffened limbs can affect a person's balance and gait, causing awkward 'statue-like' falls where the affected person cannot put out their arms to soften the impact.[6] Alongside growing stiffness, many with SPS develop bouts of muscle spasms that are triggered by sudden movements as well as feeling upset or startled.[6] Spasms are sometimes accompanied by elevated blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and sweating.[6] Some experience chronic muscle pain.[6]

In addition to their physical symptoms, many with SPS experience neurological and psychiatric disorders.[14] Some with SPS have various neurological disorders that affect physical reflexes, and the movement of the eyes.[6] Some also experience anxiety, depression, alcohol use disorders, and phobias – particularly agoraphobia.[6] Most patients are psychologically normal and respond reasonably to their situations. [15]
GABAA agonists,[7] usually diazepam[33] but sometimes other benzodiazepines,[34] are the primary treatment for SPS. Drugs that increase GABA activity alleviate muscle stiffness caused by a lack of GABAergic tone.[7] They increase pathways that are dependent upon GABA and have muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects, often providing symptom relief.[34] Because the condition worsens over time, patients generally require increased dosages, leading to more side effects.[7]

Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, another variant of the condition,[9] includes symptoms of SPS with brainstem issues, autonomic disturbances, and myoclonus.[17] In some cases, the limbic system is affected as well.

The mechanism by which propofol interacts in the nervous system is not entirely understood. Nevertheless, it is suggested that it might be related to increased GABAergic activity in the brain.[38] As it is unrealistic to have a patient with a long-term therapy to propofol, the authors suggest that propofol could be used as a bridge therapy to a more permanent intervention in patients with SPS.[36][39]
SPS is estimated to have a prevalence of about one or two per million people.[57] It affects women up to three times as frequently as men.[57] In the United Kingdom, 119 cases were identified between 2000 and 2005.[56] It does not predominantly occur in any racial or ethnic group.[21] SPS can start at any age,[5] though it most frequently occurs in people in their 40s.[21] About 35 percent of SPS patients have type I diabetes.[7]

A variety of conditions have similar symptoms to SPS, including myelopathies, dystonias, spinocerebellar degenerations, primary lateral sclerosis, neuromyotonia, and some psychogenic disorders.[7] Tetanus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperpyrexia, chronic spinal interneuronitis, serotonin syndrome,[31] multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,[22] and Isaacs syndrome should also be excluded.[31]

The presence of antibodies against GAD is the best indication of the condition that can be detected by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Anti-GAD65 is found in about 80 percent of SPS patients. Anti-thyroid, anti-intrinsic factor, anti-nuclear, anti-RNP, and anti-gliadin are also often found in blood tests. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrates involuntary motor unit firing in SPS patients.[7] EMG can confirm the SPS diagnosis by noting spasms in distant muscles as a result of subnoxious stimulation of cutaneous or mixed nerves.[13] Responsiveness to diazepam helps confirm that the patient has SPS, as this drug will decrease stiffness and motor unit firing.[7]

Intravenous immune globulin[45] has been found to be a "well-tolerated and effective" therapy.[46] Intravenous immunoglobin is the best second-line treatment for SPS. It often decreases stiffness and improves quality of life and startle reflex. It is generally safe, but there are possible serious side effects, and it is expensive.[47] The European Federation of Neurological Societies suggests it be used when disabled patients do not respond well to diazepam and baclofen.[48]

In SPS patients, motor unit neurons fire involuntarily in a way that resembles a normal contraction. Motor unit potentials fire while the patient is at rest, particularly in the muscles which are stiff.[7] The excessive firing of motor neurons may be caused by malfunctions in spinal and supra-segmental inhibitory networks that utilize GABA.[7] Involuntary actions show up as voluntary on EMG scans:[13] even when the patient tries to relax, there are agonist and antagonist contractions.[22]
In a minority of patients with SPS, breast, ovarian, or lung cancer manifests paraneoplastically as proximal muscle stiffness. These cancers are associated with the synaptic proteins amphiphysin and gephyrin. Paraneoplastic SPS with amphiphysin antibodies and breast adenocarcinoma tend to occur together. These patients tend not to have GAD antibodies.[7] Passive transfer of SPS by plasma injection has been demonstrated in paraneoplastic SPS but not in classical SPS.[28]

The progression of SPS depends on whether it is a typical or abnormal form of the condition and the presence of comorbidities.[53]Early recognition and neurological treatment can limit its progression. SPS is generally responsive to treatment,[54] but the condition usually progresses and stabilizes periodically.[55] Even with treatment, quality of life generally declines as stiffness precludes many activities.[9] Some patients require mobility aids due to the risk of falls.[12] About 65 percent of SPS patients are unable to function independently.[56] About ten percent of SPS patients require intensive care at some point;[55] sudden death occurs in about the same number of patients.[54] These deaths are usually caused by metabolic acidosis or an autonomic crisis.[55]

"I wanted to treat this like a debut record. The band’s still called White Denim and it is because that’s what we’re calling it, essentially, but I definitely felt like we needed to go back-to-basics. It was like we write the tunes, rehearse them for a week or two weeks – we didn’t do a lot pre-production – then just bang it out. It was the first time to go in with a producer from the beginning of a record and finish with a producer as well."

Stiff was released on March 25, 2016, on Downtown Records. Mark Demig, who reviewed the album for AllMusic said "The edgy energy that's long been the band's trademark is present in abundance here, which is welcome news since Stiff debuts a new White Denim lineup." and added that "The tone here is frequently playful, especially when Petralli lets his blue-eyed soul accents come forth. But the attack is taut and the force of this music is no joke."[6] NME give the album three out of five stars, concluding "[The group] wear their virtuosity proudly and with each album their brand of bluesy, Southern-style boogie-woogie becomes less obscured by experimentation, although whether or not that’s a good thing is a moot point. This is certainly the kind of music punk had to be invented for."[7] The Guardian awarded Stiff four out of five stars, praising the soul influence on the songwriting – "Live, they may make your knees shake like Robert Plant, but on record the musicianship often eclipses the songs, resulting in a lack of truly memorable bangers. [Corsicana Lemonade] went some way towards changing that, but on their seventh, the Ethan Johns-produced Stiff, they’ve nailed it by embracing soul – or rather, running into its syrupy-sweet waters."[10]

After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style is known as contemporary R&B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style. The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994.
The syndicated music/dance variety television series Soul Train, hosted by Chicago native Don Cornelius, debuted in 1971.[47] The show provided an outlet for soul music for several decades, also spawning a franchise that saw the creation of a record label (Soul Train Records) that distributed music by the Whispers, Carrie Lucas, and an up-and-coming group known as Shalamar.[48] Numerous disputes led to Cornelius spinning off the record label to his talent booker, Dick Griffey, who transformed the label into Solar Records, itself a prominent soul music label throughout the 1980s.[48] The TV series continued to air until 2006, although other predominantly African-American music genres such as hip-hop began overshadowing soul on the show beginning in the 1980s.[49]

Hits were made using a quasi-industrial "production-line" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland were rarely out of the charts for their work as songwriters and record producers for the Supremes, the Four Tops and Martha and the Vandellas.[50] They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. The rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or tambourine. Smokey Robinson was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to "The Tracks of My Tears" by his group the Miracles, which was one of the most important songs of the decade.

The key subgenres of soul include the Motown style, a more pop-friendly and rhythmic style; deep soul and southern soul, driving, energetic soul styles combining R&B with southern gospel music sounds; Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which came out of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; as well as psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music.

Neo soul is a blend of 1970s soul-style vocals and instrumentation with contemporary R&B sounds, hip-hop beats, and poetic interludes. The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s, and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and record label executive Kedar Massenburg. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of Fender Rhodes or Wurlitzer electric piano "pads" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.

Important innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included Clyde McPhatter, Hank Ballard, and Etta James.[13] Ray Charles is often cited as popularizing the soul music genre with his series of hits, starting with 1954's "I Got a Woman".[20] Singer Bobby Womack said, "Ray was the genius. He turned the world onto soul music."[10] Charles was open in acknowledging the influence of Pilgrim Travelers vocalist Jesse Whitaker on his singing style.

"What Is Swamp Rock? A look at this Southern mix of country, funk, and soul"
By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres.[42] Artists like James Brown led soul towards funk music, which became typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic and the Meters.[43] More versatile groups such as War, the Commodores, and Earth, Wind and Fire became popular around this time.[44] During the 1970s, some slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates and Oakland's Tower of Power achieved mainstream success, as did a new generation of street-corner harmony or "city-soul" groups such as the Delfonics and the historically black Howard University's Unifics.[45][46]
In Detroit, producer Don Davis worked with Stax artists such as Johnnie Taylor and the Dramatics.[39] Early 1970s recordings by the Detroit Emeralds, such as Do Me Right, are a link between soul and the later disco style.[40] Motown Records artists such as Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson contributed to the evolution of soul music, although their recordings were considered more in a pop music vein than those of Redding, Franklin and Carr.[32] Although stylistically different from classic soul music, recordings by Chicago-based artists are often considered part of the genre.[41]

Soul music dominated the U.S. African-American music charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S.Otis Redding was a huge success at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.[10] The genre also became highly popular in the UK, where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s. "Soul" became an umbrella term for an increasingly wide variety of R&B-based music styles – from the dance and pop-oriented acts at Motown Records in Detroit, such as the Temptations, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, to "deep soul" performers such as Percy Sledge and James Carr.[32][33][34] Different regions and cities within the U.S., including New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama (the home of FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios) became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles.[15][35]

Stax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well-known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.[51][page needed]Stax Records, founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind Motown Records. They were responsible for releasing hits by Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, and many more.[52] Ahmet Ertegun, who had anticipated being a diplomat until 1944 when his father died, founded Atlantic Records in 1947 with his friend Herb Abramson. Ertegun wrote many songs for Ray Charles and the Clovers. He even sang backup vocals for his artist Big Joe Turner on the song, "Shake Rattle and Roll".[53]

While the subgenre is still focused on human, often romantic, relationships, it presents them in more artificial, material constructs. These aspects of hypersoul are more in line with the 'playa' culture of hip-hop and modern R&B culture. In his 2001 article on the genre, Bat describes it as being "more like an accent than a genre".[78] Hypersoul is also remarkable for possessing a more European sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male–female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. These attitudes can be seen as success of the early blueswomen of the 1920s such as Ma Rainey.[79] Performers included Timbaland, Aaliyah, Whitney Houston and Destiny's Child. Hypersoul maybe also be seen as a precursor to modern R&B.
Ben E. King also achieved success in 1961 with "Stand By Me", a song directly based on a gospel hymn.[10] By the mid-1960s, the initial successes of Burke, King, and others had been surpassed by new soul singers, including Stax artists such as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, who mainly recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama.According to Jon Landau:[27]

Though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the R&B market in the early 1950s, only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time; the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of rock and roll sung gospel-style.
Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the African American community throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s.[2] It has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues.[3] Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, where U.S. record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.[4] It also had a resurgence with artists like Erykah Badu under the genre neo-soul.[5]

Soul music has its roots in traditional African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles – in both lyrical content and instrumentation – that began in the 1950s. The term "soul" had been used among African-American musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an African-American in the United States.[12]According to musicologist Barry Hansen,[13]

Psychedelic soul, sometimes known as "black rock", was a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of funk music a few years later.[67] Early pioneers of this subgenre of soul music include Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Norman Whitfield, and Isaac Hayes.[68] While psychedelic rock began its decline, the influence of psychedelic soul continued on and remained prevalent through the 1970s.[69][failed verification]

In the early 1960s, small soul scenes began popping up around the UK. Liverpool in particular had an established black community from which artists such as Chants and Steve Aldo emerged and go on to record within the British music industry. As a result, many recordings were commercially released by British soul acts during the 1960s which were unable to connect with the mainstream market.[70] Nevertheless, soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the British Invasion, most significantly the Beatles.[71] There were a handful of significant British blue-eyed soul acts, including Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones.[72] In the 1970s Carl Douglas, the Real Thing and Delegation[73] had hits in the UK. American soul was extremely popular among some youth sub-cultures like the mod, Northern soul and modern soul movements, but a clear genre of British soul did not emerge until the 1980s when several artists including George Michael, Sade, Simply Red, Lisa Stansfield and Soul II Soul enjoyed commercial success.[74] The popularity of British soul artists in the U.S., most notably Amy Winehouse, Adele, Estelle, Duffy, Joss Stone and Leona Lewis, led to talk of a "Third British Invasion" or "British Soul Invasion" in the 2000s and 2010s.[75][76]

By the 1970s, African-American popular musicians had drawn from the conceptual album-oriented approach of the then-burgeoning progressive rock development. This progressive-soul development inspired a newfound sophisticated musicality and ambitious lyricism in black pop.[57] Among these musicians were Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, and George Clinton.[58] In discussing the progressive soul of the 1970s, Martin cites this period's albums from Wonder (Talking Book, Innervisions, Songs in the Key of Life), War (All Day Music, The World Is a Ghetto, War Live), and the Isley Brothers (3 + 3).[59] Isaac Hayes's 1969 recording of "Walk on By" is considered a "classic" of prog-soul, according to City Pages journalist Jay Boller.[60] Later prog-soul music includes recordings by Prince,[61] Peter Gabriel,[62] Meshell Ndegeocello, Joi,[63] Bilal, Dwele, Anthony David,[64] Janelle Monáe,[65] and the Soulquarians, an experimental black-music collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s.[66]

Memphis soul is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at Stax Records and Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, Hammond organ, bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's Al Green and Stax's Booker T. & the M.G.'s. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged Southern soul style. The Hi Records house band (Hi Rhythm Section) and producer Willie Mitchell developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style but had their own unique sound.
"Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's "Just Out Of Reach". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke — primarily in a pop vein.Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement."[26]

According to AllMusic, "Soul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the '60s."[15] The phrase "soul music" itself, referring to gospel-style music with secular lyrics, was first attested in 1961.[16] The term "soul" in African-American parlance has connotations of African-American pride and culture. Gospel groups in the 1940s and '50s occasionally used the term as part of their names. The jazz style that originated from gospel became known as soul jazz. As singers and arrangers began using techniques from both gospel and soul jazz in African-American popular music during the 1960s, soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for African-American popular music at the time.[17][18]

Another term is brown-eyed soul, or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by Latinos in Southern California during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.[80][81] The genre of soul music occasionally draws from Latin, and often contains rock music influences.[82] This contrasts with blue-eyed soul, soul music performed by non-Hispanic white artists.[83] Ritchie Valens, one of the original pioneers of brown-eyed soul music, also became one of the first brown-eyed soul artists to bring traditional Latin music and rock and roll influences into the genre. Latino groups on the East and West Coast also drew from the funk-influenced Philadelphia soul, or "Philly" soul. The West Coast Latin rock scene continued to influence brown-eyed soul artists as well. Inspired by Valens, 1960s and 1970s bands such as Cannibal & the Headhunters ("Land of a Thousand Dances") and Thee Midniters played brown-eyed R&B music with a rebellious rock and roll edge. Many of these artists drew from the frat rock and garage rock scenes. However, the large Hispanic population on the West Coast began gradually moving away from energetic R&B to romantic soul, and the results were "some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late '60s and '70s."[80]

As disco and funk musicians had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from fusion and adult contemporary. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, the Commodores and Con Funk Shun would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, Peabo Bryson, Chaka Khan, and Larry Graham.
Northern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British mod subculture in Northern England and the English Midlands, based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase northern soul was coined by a journalist Dave Godin and popularised through his column in Blues and Soul magazine.[77] The rare soul records were played by DJs at nightclubs, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an uptempo beat, such as those on Motown and smaller labels, not necessarily from the Northern United States.
The New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Huey Piano Smith made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of Funk music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was a songwriter, arranger, and producer Allen Toussaint.He worked with such artists as Irma Thomas ("the Soul Queen of New Orleans"), Jessie Hill, Chris Kenner, Benny Spellman, and Ernie K. Doe on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, Betty Harris, and Aaron Neville. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels—notably Lee Dorsey for New York-based Amy Records and the Meters for New York-based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.

Chicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. Vee Jay Records, which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by Jerry Butler, Betty Everett, Dee Clark, and Gene Chandler. Chess Records, mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced several major soul artists, including the Dells and Billy Stewart. Curtis Mayfield not only scored many hits with his group, the Impressions, but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for the Fascinations, Major Lance, and the Five Stairsteps.

By 1968, while at its peak of popularity, soul began to fragment into different subgenres.Artists such as James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone evolved into funk music, while other singers such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield and Al Green developed slicker, more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties of the genre.[10] However, soul music continued to evolve, informing most subsequent forms of R&B from the 1970s-onward, with pockets of musicians continuing to perform in traditional soul style.[15]

Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also are often acknowledged as soul forefathers.[10][23] Cooke became popular as the lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, before controversially moving into secular music. His recording of "You Send Me" in 1957 launched a successful pop music career. Furthermore, his 1962 recording of "Bring It On Home To Me" has been described as "perhaps the first record to define the soul experience".[24] Jackie Wilson, a contemporary of both Cooke and James Brown, also achieved crossover success, especially with his 1957 hit "Reet Petite". He even was particularly influential for his dramatic delivery and performances.[25]

Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound.[6] The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds.[6] Soul music reflects the African-American identity, and it stresses the importance of an African-American culture. The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music that boasted pride in being black,[7] and being such a creative genre of music, it emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans' awareness of their African ancestry.[8] Soul music also combines different elements of music which includes gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz.[9]
The impact of soul music was manifold; internationally, white and other non-black musicians were influenced by soul music. British soul and Northern soul, rare soul music played by DJs at nightclubs in Northern England, are examples.

The terms deep soul and southern soul generally refer to a driving, energetic soul style combining R&B's energy with pulsating southern United States gospel music sounds. Memphis, Tennessee, label Stax Records nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands Booker T & the MGs (with Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, and Al Jackson) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of the Mar-Keys, trumpeter Wayne Jackson and saxophonist Andrew Love).
Mitchell's Hi Records continued in the Stax tradition of the previous decade, releasing a string of hits by Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Clay, O.V. Wright and Syl Johnson.[36] Bobby Womack, who recorded with Chips Moman in the late 1960s, continued to produce soul recordings in the 1970s and 1980s.[37][38]

Writer Peter Guralnick is among those to identify Solomon Burke as a key figure in the emergence of soul music, and Atlantic Records as the key record label. Burke's early 1960s songs, including "Cry to Me", "Just Out of Reach" and "Down in the Valley" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote:

Several terms were introduced, such as "blue-eyed soul", which is R&B or soul music performed by white artists. The meaning of blue-eyed soul has evolved over the decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by Motown Records and Stax Records.[28] The Righteous Brothers, the Rascals, Spencer Davis Group, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison & Them, and the Grass Roots were famous blue-eyed soul musicians in the 1960s. The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other music genres that are influenced by soul music. Artists like Hall and Oates, David Bowie, Teena Marie, Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds, Frankie Valli, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse and Adele are known as blue-eyed soul singers.

Hypersoul is a medley of soul and dance music. It maintains the vocal quality, techniques, and style, but includes a movement towards technology, materialism, heightened sexuality, and sensationalism in the rhythm and lyricism. These values represent a departure from the typical religious and spiritual undercurrents of traditional soul music.

Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain, and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.[10] Many soul artists gained popularity due to the domination of soul music in the R&B charts. Among these artists were Ray Charles, James Brown and the soul group The Temptations.[11] By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to psychedelic and progressive soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.

AllMusic calls this "laboriously constructed" album "a masterpiece".[1] The new production value (and occasional flute solo or dreamy string arrangement) did "nothing to water down the band's muscular interplay," according to Jason Lymangrover. A reviewer calls bassist Steve Terebecki and drummer Josh Block "one of the most badass rhythm sections this side of Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding", and praises guitarists Jenkins and James Petralli for playing off one another perfectly, "intertwining jazzy guitar noodling, prog scales, and rock riffs." "Everything is tightly structured, and melodies are of the highest importance, especially in the album's explosive single 'Drug,' which blends a raw groove and Southern Americana slack along with Summer of Love lyrics," the critic writes.[1]

Speaking of a newcomer, James Petralli credited Jenkins with having "brought a lightness and sense of humor back to the group". "I think for a short while we were running the risk of losing that, which is crazy because fun and laughter have always been such an essential part of our collaboration," the singer/guitarist added. He discarded any doubts concerning the 'studio experience' which might have had any detrimental effect upon a band's collective psyche: "I don't feel like any of the 'soul' was lost. The quality of the equipment and environment should have an impact on the music, and it certainly did on this record".[3]

According to Rolling Stone, White Denim are "...like a jam band that refuses to be boring", mixing sublimely "psychedelia, hardblues, boogie, prog rock and fusion riffs like inspired kids weaned on 64GB iPods and 64-ounce Slurpees" in a way that "often recalls late-Sixties Grateful Dead, when their songs still had garage-rock drive but were exploding every which way."[7] "The freakouts are mathematically calibrated, come with joyous hooks, and can coalesce into something conventionally heroic," notes Uncut magazine.[12] The album has been described as "White Denim's most thrillingly off-kilter record to date" and "another joyous rampage through rock's dusty attic" by Mojo and Q critics, respectively.[12]

After their third studio album, Fits, White Denim made some changes: they expanded from a power trio to a four-piece, adding a second guitarist Austin Jenkins and came to use more sophisticated studio.[1] "First and foremost the gear we were using, it kind of brought out different performances. Before we were in a trailer, using a lot of lo-fi equipment to try to stretch it out, and with this one we played in a really nice studio and had access to things we hadn’t before, and we were kind of hearing everything much more clearly and it got different performances out of us," James Petralli said in an interview.[2] This new approach, according to Allmusic, resulted in a work marked by "warmer, acoustic spirit and a more expansive, swirly psychedelic style".[1]

At the turn of 2011, Clash took on an entirely new look, ditching its previous glossy feel and music-led design for an altogether more artistically-led approach. In 2013, it launched a Smartphone channel, the iOS Apple Magazine app of which went on to win 'Best Music Magazine' at the Digital Magazine Awards. In February 2014 it expanded into Android handsets.

In November 2014, the magazine published its 99th edition, but then withdrew from print publication in favour of moving to an online-first operation. The Web-based service continued throughout the magazine's absence from the news-stands. In late 2015 it was announced that Clash would return to print as a bimonthly magazine from February 2016, beginning its revived run with a 100th issue special.[5]

The Clash Live brand's London activity used to incorporate a once-monthly club night at The Lexington, part of their tastemaking Ones To Watch section, which has played host to acts including Swimming, Three Trapped Tigers, Alpines and Wild Palms. More recently, this activity re-branded to be called 'Next Wave' in order to reflect internal changes in the magazine and now enjoys a residency at Hackney's new Oslo venue.

Let's Talk About It is the first release for Austin, Texas-based indie/blues rockers White Denim. Written and recorded in drummer Joshua Block's vintage 1940s Spartan trailer, the EP was released May 12, 2007.[1] Clocking in at nearly 14 minutes, this five-song 7" record is full of fast-paced, psychedelic-fused blues rock.Since its release, the EP has received critical acclaim, receiving the title of second-best album of 2007 by Gorilla vs. Bear.
