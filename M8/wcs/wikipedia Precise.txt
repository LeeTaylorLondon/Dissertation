F. E. Baker Ltd was a British motorcycle engine and cyclecar engine manufacturer based in the Precision Works, Moorsom Street, Birmingham, England. Founded in 1906 by Frank Edward Baker, the company produced motorcycle engines under the Precision trademark until 1919. Precision engines were used by a wide range of motorcycle manufacturers in the United Kingdom and in other parts of the Commonwealth and were also used in cyclecars. Many manufacturers used the 'Precision' trademark as part of their model names, and in 1912 there was a 'Precision' motorcycle sold in Australia, but it is unclear if this was manufactured by F.E. Baker or just permitted use of the trademark by a motorcycle manufacturer.

Another unusual engine project was the development during 1912 of the engine invented by Dr Archibald Low in 1911. The engine was titled the Forced Induction Engine, but it used normal atmospheric induction but high pressure fuel admitted directly into the cylinder at peak compression, so in modern parlance would be a gasoline direct injection engine. The engine was 104mm bore by 78mm stroke producing 15 bhp at 3,300rpm.[7] It appears this engine did not make it into production, but it embodied some principles that have parallels in diesel engine and gasoline direct injection engines of the future. Details of the engine can be found in US Patent 1124157 of 1913.[8]

The Morgan three-wheeler from 1912 to 1914 had a Precision V-twin engine option.[14]
Before WW1 there was a booming business with mainly cycle makers adding motorcycles to their production. This was facilitated by companies that provided engines, forks, seats, gearboxes, magnetos, lights and belt drives, allowing the frame maker to assemble his motorcycle. One of the main engine suppliers was JA Prestwich Industries (known as JAP), and to some extent F.E. Baker were targeting their market. The Precision V-twin introduced at the Olympia show in November 1911, followed the same 50 degree V angle as the existingJAP V-twin. While some motorcycle and cyclecar manufacturers stuck to a single supplier, others swapped between engine suppliers, and some allowed customers to decide which engine they wanted fitting. In November each year the Motor Cycle show was held at Olympia, and a Buyers Guide published which in most cases revealed the engine supplier used by the companies, enabling an idea of the large number of motorcycles using Precision engines in the UK.[10]
The Ranger made by the Ranger Cycle Co, West Orchard, Coventry used the water-cooled version of the 964cc V-twin.[15]
The Walker 1912-1914 cyclecar made by R. Walker and Sons of Tyseley, Birmingham, used Precision engines.
The Premier cyclecar used a 7-9 hp Precision air-cooled engine.[13]
The Warne cyclecar, was launched in 1912 with a JAP air-cooled engine, but by 1913 had swapped to air-cooled or water-cooled Precision engines (models K and KW).[15]

Whether F.E. Baker manufactured a complete motorcycle before WW1 is unclear, even though a 1912 Precision motorcycle is featured on an Australian postage stamp issued in 2018. It seems more likely the motorcycle was built by another manufacturer using a Precision engine and allowed to use the Precision name. Many Precision engined motorcycles used 'Precision' as part of the model name, hence Ivy-Precision, Grandex-Precision, etc. The 350cc 2-stroke announced in 1919, though, was a complete Precision motorcycle.

The "Green" engine was unusual in that it was water cooled but with heat exchangers mounted directly on either side of the cylinder. It was used by Ernest Smith and Woodhouse, who were motorcycle manufacturers (1912-1915), in their Regal-Green motorcycle in 1914. They had used other Baker 'Precision' engines in their previous motorcycles which they marketed as Regal-Precision.

Tom Biggs was appointed as chief designer in 1913.[2] Frank Baker stopped motorcycle & engine production during the First World War.[3] After the war they announced their own motorcycle with 350cc Precision 2-stroke engine designed by Tom Biggs. This had front and rear suspension, unit construction, and a pressed steel petrol tank that formed part of the frame.[4] To inject capital into the company in 1919 the company came to a financial arrangement with William Beardmore and Company, a Scottish engineering and shipbuilding company based in Glasgow, and became Beardmore Precision Motorcycles.[3]

A remarkably wide range of engines was developed over just a few years - this list is mainly taken from the home market motorcycle engine catalogue circa 1913 (except where otherwise indicated) so does not include variants specific to the overseas market, or the engines adapted for cyclecar use which had modifications like alternative magneto locations.

Frank Baker's engine production business grew at a fast rate, and in 1911 they added an 'excellently equipped fitting shop at the works of Messrs Webley and Scott' and by the 1911 Olympia Motorcycle Show in London there were 96 motorcycles with Baker's Precision engines.[1]

The 170cc engine had the unusual characteristic of horizontal overhead valves located at the rear of the cylinder, as well as unit-construction (see images). The valves were changed the next year to normal side-valves but remained across the rear of the engine, so this was an unusual engine. Engine capacity was increased to 199cc at the same time.
F.E. Baker sold engines to motorcycle manufacturers and to dealers under the Precision name, and for some of the larger customers they had their own name cast into the timing cover and the word Precision absent from the crankcase casting. An article in 1914 says that the Peerless Precision V-twin made solely for export was now to be made available in the home market 'under certain circumstances'.[5] Differences from the UK engines included round cylinder fins instead of square and an external flywheel. There was a thriving export market for Precision engines, especially in Australia, where companies like Lewis of Adelaide used the Precision engines. Engines were distributed through sole agents as follows :
The Depford from Depford Co., Evelyn Street, Deptford, London used either the Blumfield, J.A.P., or Precision water-cooled engines.[15]
Other makes of motorcycle to use Precision engines before WW1, include Zenith, Cleveland, New Imperial, Coventry-Eagle, Armis, Chater-Lea, S.G. Neal (Neal Precision) and in Australia A.G. Healing had distribution rights for the engines, making their own motorcycles under the tradename 'Peerless', but also supplying others such as Vivian Lewis Ltd, and Bullock.
The 225cc Precision 2-stroke engine that appears against 3 different manufacturers in the November 1914 buyers guide (see info below) also appears in the 1915 Buyers Guide in the model by Grandex and in a short article on 1916 Torpedo motorcycles in November 1915,[9] suggesting this engine did enter into production, though production may have been restricted due to the war effort. Even before war orders instructed companies to turn to making parts solely for the war effort, there were serious problems with loss of staff who volunteered for war service.

Precisionist artists often focused on urban imagery: office towers, apartment houses, bridges, tunnels, subway platforms, streets, the skyline and grid of the modern city.Other artists, however, such as Georgia O'Keeffe, Charles Demuth, Niles Spencer, Ralston Crawford, Sanford Ross, and Charles Sheeler, applied the same approach to more pastoral settings and painted starkly geometric renderings of barns, cottages, country roads, and farm houses.Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy painted still life compositions in a Precisionist style.
Varying degrees of abstraction are found in Precisionist works. The Figure 5 in Gold (1928) by Charles Demuth, an homage to William Carlos Williams' imagist poem about a fire truck is abstract and stylized, while the paintings of Charles Sheeler sometimes verge on a form of photorealism. (In addition to his meticulously detailed paintings like River Rouge Plant and American Landscape, Sheeler, like his friend Paul Strand, also created sharply focused photographs of factories and public buildings.[8])Some Precisionist work tended toward a "highly controlled approach to technique and form" as well as an application of "hard-edged style to long-familiar American scenes".[9]
Precisionism was a modernist art movement that emerged in the United States after World War I. Influenced by Cubism, Purism, and Futurism, Precisionist artists reduced subjects to their essential geometric shapes, eliminated detail, and often used planes of light to create a sense of crisp focus and suggest the sleekness and sheen of machine forms. At the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, Precisionism celebrated the new American landscape of skyscrapers, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called "Cubist-Realism."[1]The term "Precisionism" was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr[2] although according to Amy Dempsey the term "Precisionism" was coined by Charles Sheeler.[3] Painters working in this style were also known as the "Immaculates", which was the more commonly used term at the time.[4] The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists.

American artists whose work has been labeled as reflective of Precisionism include: George Ault, Ralston Crawford, Francis Criss, Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Georgia O'Keeffe, Preston Dickinson, Elsie Driggs, Louis Lozowick, Gerald Murphy, Charles Sheeler, Niles Spencer, Morton Schamberg, Joseph Stella, [10] Charles Rosen, Dale Nichols, Millard Sheets,[11] Virginia Berresford, Henry Billings, Peter Blume, Stefan Hirsch, Edmund Lewandowski, John Storrs, Miklos Suba, Sandor Bernath, Herman Trunk, Arnold Wiltz, Clarence Holbrook Carter, Edgar Corbridge and the photographers Paul Strand and Lewis Hine. The movement had no major presence outside the United States, although it did influence Australian art where Jeffrey Smart adopted its principles.[citation needed] Although no manifesto was ever created, some of the artists were friends and frequently exhibited at the same galleries. Georgia O'Keeffe's husband, photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, was a highly regarded mentor for the group and was especially supportive of Paul Strand.[citation needed]

While influenced by European modernist artistic movements like Cubism, Purism, and Futurism, Precisionism focused on the themes of industrialization and modernization in the American landscape,using precise, sharply defined geometrical forms. Precisionist artists embraced their American identity and some were reluctant to acknowledge European artistic influences.[5]

There is a degree of reverence for the industrial age in the movement, but social commentary was not fundamental to the style. Like Pop Art, Precisionism has on occasion been interpreted as a criticism of the de-natured society it portrays, though its artists did not often feel comfortable with this reading of their work. Elsie Driggs' Pittsburgh (1926) illustrates this gap in perception.[6]A painting of black and gray steel-mill smokestacks, thick piping, and crisscrossing wires, with only clouds of smoke to relieve the severity of the image, viewers have been tempted to see this dark painting as a statement of environmental concern. To the contrary, Driggs always claimed that she intended an ironic beauty in the image and referred to it as "my El Greco." Upon seeing the painting, Charles Daniel dubbed her "one of the new classicists."[7] More often than not, Precisionism implicitly celebrated man-made dynamism and new technologies.Possible exceptions to this statement are some of the darker, more claustrophobic city paintings of Louis Lozowick and the comic anti-capitalist satires of Preston Dickinson.

Precisionism had an indirect influence on the later styles known as magic realism, pop art, and photorealism, but it was largely considered a dated "period style" by the 1950s, though its influence on advertising imagery and stage and set design continued throughout the twentieth century. Its two most famous practitioners are Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler.[citation needed]
Reunion Weekend - Old Brigade Marches down Highway 2 to the tune of Precision
The College will, when the occasion calls for it, sing along to Precision.[4]Professor Tom F. Gelley, also of the College Staff, composed words in 1932 to fit the spirit expressed in the College motto, "Truth, Duty, Valour" and measure of the music. The title "Heads Up" was a hockey expression. The work was presented to the College through the then B.S.M., J. G. Carr, and was accepted by the then Commandant, Major-General W. H. P. Elkins.[5] The lyrics by Professor Thomas Fraser Gelley, of the College Staff, were published in the R.M.C. Review in 1941.[6]
Since 1980, the 3rd verse, “We are the gentlemen cadets of RMC” was changed to “We are the officer cadets of RMC”.[7]

The as-yet untitled composition was presented to RMC in the spring of 1932, it was orchestrated for military band by Captain F. W. Coleman of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery.
^ Ex Cadet Remembers the RMC March Past “Precision” and Wonders…
The lyrics have been altered over time. In the late 1950s the 3rd verse, “And strive to keep our Empire’s unity” became “And strive to keep our country’s unity”; and in the 4th verse, “For Canada and for our Empire great” became: “For Canada our land both broad and great”.
Centre for Automotive Materials and Manufacturing at Queens and RMC
Precision was inspired by "Madelon", one of the popular marching songs sung and whistled by the cadets marching on their way to the Riding School, and the favourite song of the Class of 1932. Mme Chabot improvised a variation on the song, to represent the cadence of the cadets on the march. The composition starts, “We are the gentlemen cadets of RMC We have sworn to love and serve Her Majesty…” [1]
Precision was composed in 1932 by Denise Chabot, wife of Major C. A. Chabot,[1] a Royal Canadian Artillery officer on staff as professor of French at the College at the time. She earned the degree of Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Music and was the president of the Kingston Music Club.[citation needed]

In the fall of 1933 the Associated Screen News Ltd. made a full-length feature “Precision” (1933) film, “A sample look at discipline at the Royal Military College. The emphasis is on precision gymnastics displays, ceremonial battalion marches in full uniform, and the changing of the sentry demonstrated by gentlemen cadets of the College. Seen is the exterior of the RMC buildings (the Stone Frigate)."[2] Mme Chabot found the name fitting and in 1933 called her composition by the same title.[3]

Listed on the New York Stock Exchange as PCP, the company was part of the S&P 400. In 2007, Precision was moved to the S&P 500 stock index.[22][23] As seen in the table above, PCP's revenue increased by 52 percent in 2007, to $5.4 billion from $3.5 billion in 2006. Total debt increased by 29 percent, from $677 million in 2006 to $873 million in 2007. The increases in revenue and debt were due in part to a pair of acquisitions in February 2007: GSC Foundries, Inc. (GSC), formerly a competitor to PCP in producing aluminum and steel structural investment castings, and Cherry Aerospace LLC (Cherry), a manufacturer of aerospace blind rivets and blind bolts.[24]

In July 2013, Syncsort announced its data protection business would be spun-off, and later that year it was sold to an investor group led by Bedford Venture Partners and Windcrest Partners.[18][15] Flavio Santoni, CEO of the newly formed data protection company, told CRN that "I joined Syncsort in 2009, and it was clear the company had two separate businesses: ETL and data protection. Both had different customers and dealt with different purchasing people. They were really two stand-alone businesses."[15]
In 2004, Syncsort introduced DMExpress, which added extract, transform and load (ETL) integration capabilities, metadata management and improved job management.[14]
In January 2023,Precisely acquired Transerve, co-founded by an IITian graduate Ashwanii Rawat. Transerve isa location intelligence provider in India
The Syncsort product started to sell well in the United States as well.[6]In the IBM mainframe era, many commercial applications revolved around sequential file processing, where master files, often kept on tape storage, were sorted in various orders before being input to application code.In such batch job environments, the sort utility was frequently invoked, and the utility's performance had a significant impact on overall throughput.[8] Syncsort was drop-in replaceable for the IBM sort utility, without having to change JCL statements or application code, and thus was easy to switch to.[9]For some customers, Syncsort was their first non-IBM software purchase.[6]

Whitlow Computer Systems renamed itself to Syncsort, Inc. around 1981.(At some point the product name was stylized as SyncSort, with the second 'S' capitalized, while the company name retained a regular spelling.[4])By then, Syncsort had a dominant position in the IBM mainframe world.A survey done by IDC during 1983 of IBM customers running OS/VS1 or MVS revealed that 75 percent of them were using SyncSort, as compared to 18 percent who were using the IBM-provided sort utility and 7 percent who were using other sort programs.[4]

According to Whitlow, the company's original task was to develop an airlines reservations system for Control Data.[6] In the course of that work, the founders encountered timing charts for IBM's existing sort utility, and thought they could build a sort that was much faster. Sales improved after then-startup Computerworld published a front page story about the Syncsort product. That story resulted in openings in Europe, and the company was one of the first to sell an independent software product in Europe.[6]
In 2017 Centerbridge Partners acquired Syncsort along with Vision Solutions.[26][31] Josh Rogers continued as CEO of the merged companies, which continued to operate as Syncsort and use the slogan “Big Iron to Big Data.”[26] The phrase reflected Syncsort's ability to cover mainframe computers as well as cloud-based analytics systems.[26][32][28]

The American Deluxe Precision Bass was added to the revamped lineup in 1995. It had an Ash Body (offered until 2006), 18-volt preamp with 3-Band Active EQ and an added Humbucker in the bridge position.
Fender offered the Made-in-Mexico Blacktop Series from 2013 to 2014.Like Most of the other instruments in this series, the Blacktop Precision Bass was given high-output humbuckers.It also had a Hi-Mass Bridge, Vintage Jazz Bass Style Knobs (Volume, Volume, Tone) and a C-shape neck with 9.5" Radius.[9]
In 1960 the aluminum pickguard was replaced with a 13-screw celluloid design having 3 or 4 layers of black, white, white pearloid or with a brown "tortoise-shell" pattern). In the same year the newly designed Fender Jazz Bass was released.
In 1983, Fender introduced the Standard Series with a new Bullet truss rod system, updated die-cast tuning machines, chrome hardware, white pickup covers and a single-ply white pick guard.The Headstock graphics were changed to reflect a blend of new and vintage.The Fender logo remained underneath the string guide but was changed to silver with a black outline. The "Precision Bass" wordmark was changed to a boldface font similar to the early 1960s model but remained to the right of the Fender logo.From 1984 to 2000, this would be referred to as the American Standard Precision Bass.The most notable visual change was the return to black pickup covers.The model was revamped in 1995.In 1996, a special run of 500 instruments was sold as the Limited Edition 50th Anniversary Precision Bass to celebrate the company's anniversary.This model had gold hardware and a "Fender 50" stamp on the neck plate.[6]
Squier introduced the Vintage-Modified Series in 2007 to slot between the Affinity Series and the Made-In-Mexico Fenders.The Squier Vintage-Modified Precision Bass Had a Duncan Designed™ PB101 Split Single-Coil Pickup and late-70's style headstock graphics.The Squier Vintage-Modified Precision Bass PJ was added in 2013 with Fender-designed Split Single-Coil Precision and Single-coil Jazz Pickups. Both models (along with the rest of the line) were subsequently replaced with Fender-Designed pickups before the Vintage-Modified line was discontinued altogether by 2019.

From 1980 to 1984 various models of the Precision Bass were given new active pickups and a high-mass brass bridge. The Special (1980) featured a split-coil pickup with white covers, gold hardware, a 2-band EQ and an active/passive toggle switch. The Elite (1983) had one (Elite I) or two (Elite II) split-coil humbucking pickups, TBX tone circuit and a Schaller fine-tune bridge later used on the Plus Series models of the early 1990s. Some models were available with solid walnut body and stained ebony fretboard.

The double bass is among the largest and most physically cumbersome instruments which are regularly still transported by the player themselves on their own. It is also hard to hear in large bands or those that use amplified instruments, and it requires specialized skills to play that are distinct from those required to play the guitar. The Precision Bass was designed to overcome these drawbacks. In particular, the name "Precision" came from the use of frets to play in tune more easily than on the fretless fingerboard of the double bass.

The original Telecaster-derived design, with a few updates, was reintroduced in 1968 as the Fender Telecaster Bass. Within a few years, this evolved into a model distinctly different from the contemporary Precision Bass, alongside which it was marketed through 1979.[5] Two artist-designed models use the Telecaster Bass body style; the Mike Dirnt Precision Bass, using today's standard single split-coil pick-up, and the Sting Precision Bass, using a single coil pick-up as did the earliest design.

The Fender Precision Bass (often shortened to "P-Bass") is a model of electric bass guitar manufactured by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. In its standard, post-1957 configuration, the Precision Bass is a solid body, four-stringed instrument usually equipped with a single split-coil humbucking pickup and a one-piece, 20-fret maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard.[1]
In 1984, Fender introduced a lower cost Standard Precision Bass model made in Japan.The Standard model would be made in Japan until 1990 when Fender shifted operations to its new Mexican factory which produced the model from 1991 to 2018.
The American Series Precision Bass was introduced in 2000 and discontinued in 2008. From 2003 the S-1 switching system allowed the pickup coils to be switched from series to parallel, offering a wider tonal range, but this was discontinued in 2008 with the second generation of American Standard Series instruments. 2011 models bear a special "Fender 60" badge on the back of the body to celebrate the company's 60th Anniversary.
The Road Worn Series 50s P-Bass (introduced in 2009) features a distressed alder body with nitrocellulose lacquer finish, a 1-ply gold anodized pickguard, a synthetic bone nut, American Vintage hardware, a split-coil humbucking pickup and a one-piece maple neck/fingerboard with 20 vintage frets.
There are many artists known for using the Precision Bass Guitar. A few of the more notable artists include: James Jamerson,[20] Peter Cetera,[21] Donald "Duck" Dunn,[22][23] Pino Palladino,[24] Steve Harris,[25] Mike Dirnt,[26] Tony Franklin,[27] Duff McKagan,[28] Sting,[29] Michael Steele, John Lodge,[30] Dee Dee Ramone, CJ Ramone, Roger Waters,[31] Dallon Weekes, Nate Mendel, Dusty Hill, Carol Kaye, Geezer Butler, Markus Grosskopf, Robert Trujillo, Waylon Jennings, Jason Newsted, John Paul Jones, John Cale,[32] Pete Wentz, Matt Freeman, Randy Meisner, Roger Glover, Tom Hamilton, Mark Hoppus, Gildo Masini, Roy Estrada, Kenny Gradney, Aimee Mann, David Brown, Frank Bello, Chi Cheng, Jeff Ament, Andy Bell, John Deacon, Tony Stevens, Pete Way, Cliff Williams, Tom "T-Bone" Wolk, Billy Cox, Timothy B.

The current basic model is the Affinity Precision Bass.This model was introduced in 1996 and was made in China.In more recent years, the Affinity Precision Bass PJ (named for its Precision-Jazz pickup configuration) was added to the lineup.The wordmark on the headstock graphic refers to this model as a Squier P-Bass. The PJ model is currently the only variation produced and released in the Affinity line.
In January 2017, Fender retired its American Standard line to be replaced by the American Professional Series.The Precision Bass was updated with new V-Mod pickups, upgraded tuners that featured increased sustain and better tuning stability, Narrow-Tall frets and a ’63 P Bass profile neck.[12] Fender ceased production of this model in 2020.
Its prototype, designed by Leo Fender in 1950, was brought to market in 1951.[2] It was the first electric bass guitar to earn widespread attention and use, remaining among the best-selling and most-imitated electric bass guitars with considerable effect on the sound of popular music.

Upright bassists initially looked at the new instrument with similar contempt as guitar players did with its solid-body sibling, the Telecaster. It was vibraphonist/drummer Lionel Hampton's band that was among the first to incorporate the new instrument. Also, Elvis Presley's bass-player Bill Black, was beginning to use a Precision Bass during the filming of Jailhouse Rock. It was reputed that Black became so frustrated over his initial inability to get used to playing it, he angrily threw it on the floor. Fender also delivered an early Precision to Los Angeles session bassist and arranger Shifty Henry. Monk Montgomery became the second jazz player to popularize what would be widely referred to as the "Fender Bass" at the time: first playing with Lionel Hampton, and then with his brother, guitarist Wes Montgomery. By 1954 Henry and Montgomery were appearing in Fender's advertising.[3] By the end of the 1950s the "P-Bass", as it would later be called, was finally gaining acceptance with rock 'n roll and country bassists, and also with guitarists who would double on the instrument. The most notable of the latter was Carol Kaye, originally a jazz guitarist, who as a bassist became best known for her work as part of the consortium of L.A. session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew.

Precision Bass Lyte models were made in Japan and came to the market in late 1984.They had a smaller body shape and a modern C-shape maple neck with 22 medium-jumbo frets. They had an active P-J pickup configuration with a 2 band eq and pickup pan knob. They were produced until 1995.
In 2002, Fender added a new lower-cost American passive model series known as the Highway One. There were two iterations of this line - known as Highway 1 and Highway One. Highway 1 featured 60's spaghetti logo, and a nut side truss rod adjustment port. They were painted with thin nitro lacquer.In 2006, it was updated with a BadAss II bridge with grooved saddles and a Greasebucket tone circuit. The Highway One Precision Bass featured '70s styling and thin satin nitro lacquer finish. The series remained available until it was discontinued in 2011.[7]
As the electric bass guitar provides different tonal qualities than the double bass, players and bandleaders naturally needed some time to incorporate the new instrument into their musical visions. Subsequently, the more solid, harder-edged sound with more sustain of the electric bass guitar became increasingly dominant and an important factor in thetransformation of the beat and rhythm of pop music from jump blues and swing to rhythm and blues, rock music, soul and funk.
The American Standard, American Deluxe (featuring a J-style humbucking pickup in the bridge position and an active 3-band EQ with an 18V power supply), Highway Oneand American Vintage series models were manufactured in Corona, California.
Following the success of the Aerodyne Jazz Bass, Fender briefly produced the Japanese-made Aerodyne Classic Precision Bass from 2006 to 2008.This model retained the basic shape of the classic Precision but had dramatically thinner contours.It had a basswood body with figured maple top and cream binding, Precision and Single-coil Jazz pickup combination and matching finish headstock.[8]

The original Precision Bass of 1951 shared several of its design features with the six-string Telecaster guitar, the main difference being its double cutaway body. The 1954 release of the Stratocaster with its contoured edges for comfort, was inspired by the Precision bass,[4] which in kind, also received the same style body contours.In 1957 the headstock and pickguard were redesigned to resemble the Stratocaster, with a rounder neck heel replacing the original square shape. A redesigned pickguard was made of a single layer of gold-anodized aluminium with 10 screw holes. At the same time the original single-coil pickup was replaced by the "split-coil" design with staggered pole pieces which is now known as the typical Precision pickup. Its two coils are typically connected in a humbucking mode, a feature that was not emphasized by Fender at the time, as Seth Lover's patent on the humbucking pickup had not yet expired.
In May 2016, Fender brought back the American Elite Precision Bass to replace the American Deluxe series.[10]The new model featured a Precision neck pickup combined with a 4th-generation Jazz noiseless pickup, 18-volt active circuit with 3-band EQ, passive bypass switch, Posiflex graphite support rods in the neck which.The 21-fret neck profile was a modern “C” shape at the genuine bone nut, and changed along the length of the neck to a modern “D”-shaped profile at the updated neck heel, with a compound radius of 9.5 -14".[11] Fender produced this bass until 2019.

Fender made an American Deluxe 5-string model with a split-coil neck pickup, a humbucking bridge pickup and a 3-band active EQ between 1998 and 2007.In 2008, Fender first produced a passive American Standard Precision Bass V with a single passive split-coil Precision pickup (3 poles toward the neck, 2 poles toward the bridge) and single volume/tone.In would remain in the same configuration when Fender transitioned to the American Professional Precision Bass V model in 2017 and the American Professional II Precision Bass V in 2020.Squier also produced a Standard version sporting two J-Bass pickups with alnico magnets. The company has also built a Korean-made Squier ProTone Precision V with dual humbuckers and gold hardware in the mid-1990s.In the mid-2010s, Squier produced the Vintage Modified Precision Bass V with the basic passive P bass single pickup and single volume/tone.
Since 1969 the 1-piece maple neck option was offered on many Fender basses, with the rosewood fretboard as an alternative. Some Precision Basses made in the 1970s were also available with an unlined fretless rosewood, ebony or (usually) maple fingerboard, popularized by endorsees Sting and Tony Franklin.
2020 saw the introduction of a short scale Precision.The Squier Mini Precision Bass has a 28.6" (726mm) scale with 9.5" radius and 1.5" nut width.Similar to the previously introduced Mini Strat, the body remains faithful to the shape and contours of its full-size counterpart but is scaled down to correctly match with the neck.[19]

The later 1980s and 1990s saw the introduction of the Precision Plus and Deluxe Plus basses in 1989 and 1991, featuring Lace Sensor pickups, fine-tuner bridges, 22-fret necks and passive or active electronics on certain models. The limited-edition Custom Shop 40th Anniversary model of 1991 was aluxurious version of the Precision Plus Deluxe bass with gold hardware, a quilted maple top with no pickguard, highly figured neck, 3 stacked knobs and an ebony fretboard with side dot position markers. Only 400 of this model were produced. Some P-Basses with J-style bridge pickups used the Jazz Bass control layout—2 volumes and tone—and a side-mount jack socket. Others had the front pickup volume control moved forward to leave room for a top-mounted jack socket.Other variants include dual stacked control knobs similar to that of an early 1960s Jazz Bass or a 3-way pickup selector switch (as used on the Tony Franklin Signature and Plus Series P-Basses).
In the mid-1990s Fender briefly offered a fretless P-Bass as a part of the first generation of the "American Standard" line. This variant was dropped at the end of the 20th century.

In 1959 a glued-on rosewood fingerboard featuring "clay"-style dot position markers replaced the 1-piece maple neck and remained standard until 1966/67, when the CBS-owned Fender companies began to offer a separate, laminated maple fingerboard capped on a maple neck. Rosewood fingerboards were then made of a veneered, round-laminated piece of wood and pearloid dot markers replaced the "clay"-style inlays introduced in 1959.
On December 5, 2008, the American Standard Precision Bass was updated with CBS era-style decals, a 3-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard.

Of these, octuple-precision format is rarely used. The single- and double-precision formats are most widely used and supported on nearly all platforms. The use of half-precision format has been increasing especially in the field of machine learning since many machine learning algorithms are inherently error-tolerant.

Precision is often the source of rounding errors in computation. The number of bits used to store a number will often cause some loss of accuracy. An example would be to store "sin(0.1)" in IEEE single precision floating point standard. The error is then often magnified as subsequent computations are made using the data (although it can also be reduced).
In computer science, the precision of a numerical quantity is a measure of the detail in which the quantity is expressed.This is usually measured in bits, but sometimes in decimal digits. It is related to precision in mathematics, which describes the number of digits that are used to express a value.
Dell launched the E Series of laptops on August 12, 2008 with a collection of Latitude (E4200, E5400, E5500, E6400, E6500, E6400 ATG/XFR) and Precision (M4400, M2400) computers.[30] Both the Latitude and Precision computers are compatible with the new E Series docking stations (E-Port and E-Port Plus). Notably, the 17" models do not share a chassis with the Inspiron series anymore, and starting with the M4600 the 15" Precisions do not share a Latitude chassis either. QHD, UHD and RGBLED IPS models have a disabled iGPU. This has several downsides: the power consumption during low load is high and thus the battery runtimes clearly suffer despite the high-capacity battery, and Intel's QuickSync Video cannot be used. AMD GPU equipped models before the M4800/M6800 also do not support AMD Enduro Switchable Graphics.
