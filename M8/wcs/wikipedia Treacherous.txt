Treacherous Halls is a promotional e-Reader level for Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3. Its official difficulty rating is ★★★★★, making it one of the more difficult e-Reader levels. Much of the level consists of stomping enemies over spikes to cross them. Many Piranha Plants also appear, as well as two Flurries, one of which has to be ridden to collect an Advance Coin and also a 1-Up Mushroom. Boom Boom is fought at the end of the level. It was initially released only in Japan, but it eventually became available internationally when the game was brought to the Wii U Virtual Console in 2016. The key art for the card featured Boom Boom.

On February 25, 2018, Choi admitted to being guilty of sexual harassment, and was subsequently removed from the MBC drama Hold Me Tight, as well as his position on the board of directors for the Korean Actors Association and academic advisor at Sejong University.[6] However, on February 28, it was revealed later by an actress that he had actually committed sexual assault by raping her 25 years ago. Choi came under harsh criticism, as the possibility that Choi may have only confessed because he knew his name would be mentioned by the media was raised.[7][8][9][10]

"Three Periods of Korean Queer Cinema: Invisible, Camouflage, and Blockbuster"
The plot unfurls in a nonlinear fashion, often from the perspective of fellow student Soh Min-ah (Kim Min-sun). Min-ah grows increasingly invested in Shi-eun and Hyo-shin when she finds a diary kept between the two alienated girls. This diary allows her disturbing insights to the nature of the relationship and pulls her deeper into a strange chain of events around the school.After Hyo-shin's death, supernatural occurrences start to terrorize all of the students that condemned the relationship. It is later revealed that Hyo-shin's spirit is malevolently haunting the school through the remnants she left behind in the diary.
The representation of queer characters within a horror context is further aided by Korea's LGBT history. Despite being tolerated throughout most of Korean history, Neo-Confucianism, which came into prominence during the Chosŏn dynasty, eliminated acceptance towards same-sex behavior and “effectively made homosexuality invisible, ghostly.” Despite the societal implication of queer people as inherently ghostly, the film does not treat its LGBT characters as the archetypal monsters, representative of societal taboos, as in the Western horror tradition. Rather, Memento Mori’s queer characters are the heroes the story is centered around, and the ghostly terror is directed at the film’s homophobic characters.[3]
There is no comparable South Korean equivalent to the scope of the Western queer film movement.[3] Despite the increasing visibility of the Korean LGBT movement in the 1990s, when Memento Mori was made, queer films of the time frequently concealed LGBT content behind the guise of other genres, such as horror or romance. The elements of horror featured in Memento Mori, which include telepathy and possession, function as a method of creating distance between the audience's reality and the fantasy of the horror movie, and the characters therein.[4]

The film revolves around the relationship between two high school students, Yoo Shi-eun (Lee Young-jin) and Min Hyo-shin (Park Ye-jin). As the two girls become romantically involved, their taboo relationship causes them to be marginalized by the other students.Unable to cope with the social pressures of having a lover of the same gender, Shi-Eun tries to distance herself from the increasingly dependent Hyo-shin. Hyo-shin reacts poorly to Shi-eun's changed attitude, viewing it as both a betrayal and rejection.Hyo-shin consequently commits suicide by jumping off of the school roof.It is also heavily implied that she was pregnant at the time of death, the father being literature teacher Mr. Goh.

The more contemporary version of the Korean ghost story, featuring the ghost of a schoolgirl, is ideal representation for girls, who are taught to internalize their problems. The current education system in South Korea is frequently gender segregated in both middle school and high school, emphasizing distinctive gender norms and attempting to curb sexuality.[6] Lingering Confucian influences play a large role in gender segregated schools, which in turn lead to normalized “homosocial bodily contact” and significant relationships between students of the same gender.[3] This normalized intimacy between schoolgirls makes the jump from the homosocial to the queer relationship of Hyo-shin and Shi-eun plausible to the audience. However, this context of highly interdependent, exclusive female friendships, which become necessary for survival in the highly competitive environment of Korean high schools,[6]may soften the LGBT themes in Memento Mori as a result of such close relationships being accepted as a “right of passage”.[4]
In creating a uniquely Korean canon of the horror genre, Korean horror films have not imported Western-style monsters or slashers; they instead center on a ghost, most often a female ghost. Within the tradition of Korean horror cinema, the female spirit exists to get revenge on their murderers. The ghosts of early horror films typically have “lived a life of repression in a patriarchal family,”[5]and it is within the context of these heterosexual relationships that most traditional Korean horror film ghosts seek their revenge. However, the horror cycle starting with Whispering Corridors shifts the focal relationship from familial relationships to friendships, particularly those between school aged girls.[6]

Memento Mori (Korean: 여고괴담 두번째 이야기; RR: Yeogogoedam dubeonchae iyagi; also known as Whispering Corridors 2: Memento Mori) is a 1999 South Korean horror film, and the second installment of the Whispering Corridors film series. It is a sequel to 1998's Whispering Corridors, and is also set in an all-girls high school, but the films are otherwise unrelated. Memento Mori was one of the first Korean commercial films to depict lesbian characters. However, prevailing Korean attitudes constrained its potential to be widely viewed, even more so as the controversial themes targeted the teen demographic.[1][2]

When followed by another consonant or when in final position, it is written as ⟨t⟩: 옷 [ot̚] → ot (but 옷에 [o.se̞] → ose).
However, names for geographic features and artificial structures are not hyphenated: 설악산 → Seoraksan, 해인사 → Haeinsa
However, ㄱ ㄷ ㅂ ㅈ are not always romanized as ⟨g⟩ ⟨d⟩ ⟨b⟩ ⟨j⟩, depending on their environment. For example, they are romanized as ⟨k⟩ ⟨t⟩ ⟨p⟩ ⟨ch⟩ when placed in the final position, as they are neutralized to unreleased stops: 벽 [pjʌk̚] → byeok, 밖 [pak̚] → bak, 부엌 [pu.ʌk̚] → bueok, 벽에 [pjʌ.ɡe̞] → byeoge, 밖에 [pa.k͈e̞] → bakke, 부엌에 [pu.ʌ.kʰe̞] → bueoke, 컵 [kʰʌp̚] → keop.
With very few exceptions, it is impossible for a person who has ever left the country under their romanized name to change their family name again.[4] However, South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism encourages those who “newly” register their romanized names to follow the Revised Romanization of Korean. In addition, North Korea continues to use a version of the McCune–Reischauer system of romanization, a different version of which was in official use in South Korea from 1984 to 2000.

Like several European languages that have undergone spelling reforms (such as Portuguese, German or Swedish), the Revised Romanization is not expected to be adopted as the official romanization of Korean family names (example I, Bak, Gim, Choe instead of Lee, Park, Kim, Choi which are used commonly). This is because the conditions for allowing changes in romanization of surnames in passport is very strict. The reasons are outlined below.
"Romanization of Korean". National Institute of Korean Language. Retrieved 13 December 2016.
ㅅ used to be written as sh and s, depending on context. Now it will be written as s in all cases.ㅅ /s/ is written as ⟨s⟩ regardless of the following vowels and semivowels; there is no ⟨sh⟩: 사 [sa] → sa, 시 [ɕi] → si.When followed by another consonant or when in final position, it is written as ⟨t⟩: 옷 [ot̚] → ot (but 옷에 [o.se̞] → ose).
Arbitrary changes in the romanization of passports can lead to a fall in the credibility of the passports and national credit, which can have a negative impact on new visa waiver agreements, etc.

The aspiration distinction between consonants is represented in a new way. The unaspirated consonants ㄱ ㄷ ㅂ ㅈ are represented as ⟨g⟩ ⟨d⟩ ⟨b⟩ ⟨j⟩ respectively and the aspirated consonants ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅊ are represented as ⟨k⟩ ⟨t⟩ ⟨p⟩ ⟨ch⟩. These letter pairs have a similar aspiration distinction in English at the beginning of a syllable (though they also have a voicing distinction unlike Korean); this approach is also used by Hanyu Pinyin. By contrast, the McCune–Reischauer system uses ⟨k⟩ ⟨t⟩ ⟨p⟩ ⟨ch⟩ both for the unaspirated and aspirated consonants, adding an apostrophe for the aspirated versions (⟨kʼ⟩ ⟨tʼ⟩ ⟨pʼ⟩ ⟨chʼ⟩). (The McCune–Reischauer system also includes voicing, which the revised romanization does not.)However, ㄱ ㄷ ㅂ ㅈ are not always romanized as ⟨g⟩ ⟨d⟩ ⟨b⟩ ⟨j⟩, depending on their environment. For example, they are romanized as ⟨k⟩ ⟨t⟩ ⟨p⟩ ⟨ch⟩ when placed in the final position, as they are neutralized to unreleased stops: 벽 [pjʌk̚] → byeok, 밖 [pak̚] → bak, 부엌 [pu.ʌk̚] → bueok, 벽에 [pjʌ.ɡe̞] → byeoge, 밖에 [pa.k͈e̞] → bakke, 부엌에 [pu.ʌ.kʰe̞] → bueoke, 컵 [kʰʌp̚] → keop.
The new system addressed problems in the implementation of the McCune–Reischauer system, such as the phenomena where different consonants and vowels became indistinguishable in the absence of special symbols. To be specific, under the McCune–Reischauer system, Korean consonants ㄱ (k), ㄷ (t), ㅂ (p) and ㅈ (ch) and ㅋ (kʼ), ㅌ (tʼ), ㅍ (pʼ) and ㅊ (chʼ) became indistinguishable when the apostrophe was removed. In addition, Korean vowels 어 (ŏ) and 오 (o), as well as 으 (ŭ) and 우 (u), became indistinguishable when the breve was removed. Especially in internet use, where omission of apostrophes and breves is common, this caused many Koreans as well as foreigners confusion. Hence, the revision was made with the belief that if McCune–Reischauer was left unrevised, it would continue to confuse people, both Koreans and foreigners.
However, ㅝ /wʌ/ is written as ⟨wo⟩ (not ⟨weo⟩) and ㅢ /ɰi/ is written as ⟨ui⟩ (not ⟨eui⟩)
A hyphen optionally disambiguates syllables: 가을 → ga-eul (fall; autumn) versus 개울 → gae-ul (stream). However, few official publications make use of this provision since actual instances of ambiguity among names are rare.A hyphen must be used in linguistic transliterations to denote syllable-initial ㅇ except at the beginning of a word: 없었습니다 → eobs-eoss-seumnida, 외국어 → oegug-eo, 애오개 → Ae-ogae
The people of a country where it is free to change the official Roman name will be subject to strict immigration checks, which will inevitably cause inconvenience to the people of that country.

In addition, special provisions are for regular phonological rules in exceptions to transliteration (see Korean phonology).
It is permitted to hyphenate syllables in the given name, following common practice. Certain phonological changes, ordinarily indicated in other contexts, are ignored in names, for better disambiguating between names: 강홍립 → Gang Hongrip or Gang Hong-rip (not *Hongnip), 한복남 → Han Boknam or Han Bok-nam (not *Bongnam or "Bong-nam")

ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ and ㄹ are transcribed as g, d, b and r when placed at the initial of a word or before a vowel, and as k, t, p and l when followed by another consonant or when appearing at the end of a word.[5]
Almost all road signs, names of railway and subway stations on line maps and signs, etc. have been changed according to Revised Romanization of Korean (RR, also called South Korean or Ministry of Culture (MC) 2000). It is estimated to have cost at least 500 billion won to 600 billion won (US$500~600 million) to carry out this procedure.[3] All Korean textbooks, maps and signs to do with cultural heritage were required to comply with the new system by 28 February 2002. Romanization of surnames and existing companies' names has been left untouched because of the reasons explained below. However, the Korean government encourages using the revised romanization of Korean for the new names.
Phonological changes are reflected where ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ and ㅈ are adjacent to ㅎ: 좋고 → joko, 놓다 → nota, 잡혀 → japyeo, 낳지 → nachi. However, aspirated sounds are not reflected in case of nouns where ㅎ follows ㄱ, ㄷ and ㅂ: 묵호 → Mukho, 집현전 → Jiphyeonjeon.[5]

Romanization of Korean from the National Institute of Korean Language
Revised Romanization of Korean (국어의 로마자 표기법; Gug-eoui Romaja Pyogibeop; lit. "Roman-letter notation of the national language") is the official Korean language romanization system in South Korea. It was developed by the National Academy of the Korean Language from 1995 and was released to the public on 7 July 2000 by South Korea's Ministry of Culture and Tourism in Proclamation No. 2000-8.[1][2]

Works that focus on accurately portraying specific historical events or persons are instead known as docudrama, such as The Report. Where a person's life is central to the story, such a work is known as biographical drama, with notable examples being films such as Alexander,[5] Cinderella Man, Frida, House of Saddam, Lincoln, Stalin, and W..
A historical drama (also period drama, costume drama, and period piece) is a dramatic work set in a past time period, usually used in the context of film and television.
Historical drama, a type of historical fiction, includes historical romances, adventure films, and swashbucklers. A period piece may be set in a vague or general era such as the Middle Ages, or a specific period such as the Roaring Twenties, or the recent past.

In different eras different subgenres have risen to popularity, such as the westerns and sword and sandal films that dominated North American cinema in the 1950s. The costume drama is often separated as a genre of historical dramas. Early critics defined them as films focusing on romance and relationships in sumptuous surroundings, contrasting them with other historical dramas believed to have more serious themes. Other critics have defended costume dramas, and argued that they are disparaged because they are a genre directed towards women.[1] Historical dramas have also been described as a conservative genre, glorifying an imagined past that never existed.[2]
