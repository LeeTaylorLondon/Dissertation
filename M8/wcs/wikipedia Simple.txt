As of September 2011, Wikipedia had about 18 million pages in about 300 languages and more than 3.50 billion words across all Wikipedias. The regular English Wikipedia is the largest Wikipedia edition.
The English Wikipedia reached 3 million articles in August 2009. The number of articles and contributors appeared to be growing less quickly around spring 2007.[15]
On 13 January 2021, the English Wikipedia reached one billion edits, where the billionth edit was made by Steven Pruitt.[17]

Wikipedia began as a related project for Nupedia. Nupedia was a free English-language online encyclopedia project. Nupedia's articles were written and owned by Bomis, Inc which was a web portal company. The important people of the company were Jimmy Wales, the person in charge of Bomis, and Larry Sanger, the editor-in-chief of Nupedia. Nupedia was first licensed under the Nupedia Open Content License which was changed to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia was founded and made their first article when Richard Stallman requested them.[4]

"In a post-truth world, we need Wikipedia more than ever"
Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales are the ones who started Wikipedia.[5][6] Wales is credited with defining the goals of the project.[7][8] Sanger created the strategy of using a wiki to reach Wales' goal.[9] On January 10, 2001, Larry Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.[10] Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001. It was launched as an English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[11] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[7] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[12] was enforced in its initial months, and was similar to Nupedia's earlier "nonbiased" policy. Otherwise, there weren't very many rules initially, and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[7]

Wikipedia's name is a portmanteau of two words, wiki and encyclopedia.[3]
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot, and from people who looked it up. It grew to about 20,000 articles, and 18 languages by the end of 2001. By late 2002 it had 26 languages, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the end of 2004.[13] Nupedia and Wikipedia both existed until Nupedia's servers were stopped in 2003. After this, its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the 2 million-article mark on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, even larger than the Yongle Encyclopedia (1407), which had held the record for exactly 600 years.[14]

"Love Won't Let Me Wait" had its chart debut on Billboard magazine's list of the 100 most popular R&B singles in the US in the issue dated February 25, 1984, where it peaked at number 32 over the course of 12 weeks.[7] The March 24 issue marked its first appearance on the magazine's list of the 50 most popular Adult Contemporary records in the US, where it spent 13 weeks and reached number 14.[8] The next issue, dated March 31, saw its debut on the "Bubbling Under the Hot 100" chart, where it got as high as number 106.[9]

The fact that the front cover photograph was taken at the Carlyle Hotel in Miami, Florida,[3] and the choice of pastels for both the album design and the clothing Mathis wears in the photo might suggest that the look was inspired by the influential hit show Miami Vice, but the television series debuted on September 16, 1984[11]—eight months after this album was released.

Additionally, the song "Love Never Felt So Good" was based on a demo track by pop singer Michael Jackson, recorded in 1983. The following year, writer Paul Anka gave Mathis permission to use the song, at which point Mathis recorded an R&B remix with revised lyrics by Anka and Kathleen Wakefield. The Jackson version was eventually leaked online in 2006, and received a proper release under Jackson's branding in 2014 as a part of his posthumous album Xscape.
These two tracks were mixed by David Todd and Nick Martinelli and released in 1984 as a 12-inch single:[2]

On January 15, 2013, Funkytowngrooves released an expanded edition of the album on compact disc that included two additional versions of "Simple" that came out in 1984 on a separate 12-inch single.[12]
A Special Part of Me is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released on January 22, 1984,[1] by Columbia Records and reunited him with his "Too Much, Too Little, Too Late" partner Deniece Williams on one of the LP's two duets, "Love Won't Let Me Wait", which is also the only song on the album that was previously recorded and released by another artist. This continuing trend away from the cover album genre would reach its limit with his next studio release, Right from the Heart, which only had original material.

Privacy, policy and provisioning. If the centralized model is used, the User Agents need a way to define who may subscribe to which amount of their presence information. RFC 4745 and RFC 5025 define a framework for authorization policies controlling access to application-specific data. The XCAP (RFC 4825), carried by HTTP, allows User Agents to communicate their presence rules to a XCAP server, which rules the information exposed by the presence server. RFC 3857 and RFC 3858 define a subscription event "watcher info". User Agents may subscribe to this event to be informed who is subscribing to their presence information.

Presence documents. The presence information is coded in XML documents, that are carried in the bodies of the respective SIP messages. RFC 3863 and RFC 4479 describe this procedure, RFC 4480 (RPID), RFC 4481, RFC 4482 (CPID) and various drafts describe contents and formats of the presence documents.
The core protocol machinery. This provides the actual SIP extensions for subscriptions, notifications and publications. RFC 6665 defines the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods. SUBSCRIBE allows users to subscribe to an event on a server, the server responds with NOTIFY whenever the event occurs. RFC 3856 defines how to make use of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY for presence. Two models are defined: an end-to-end model in which each User Agent handles presence subscriptions itself; and a centralized model. The latter introduces the concept of a presence server; all subscriptions are handled by this server. The message PUBLISH (RFC 3903) allows User Agents to inform the presence server about their subscription states.
The Page Mode makes use of the SIP method MESSAGE, as defined in RFC 3428. This mode establishes no sessions.

Simpel was founded in 2000 by Philip Douglas and Joachim Schneebeli. The business idea was a low-maintenance and durable city bike distributed over the Internet. To that end, Simpel used only hub gear and hub dynamos.[1] The frame number stamped into the frame is also an e-mail address through which the owners of lost bicycles can be contacted.[2]

The Simple series and several of its games, including Demolition Girl, The Maid Clothes and Machine Gun, Onechanbara and the Earth Defense Force series, have garnered notoriety outside Japan for their usually outlandish and bizarre nature.[7][8] Publications have identified the series as being of considerably better quality than similar budget title ranges, with gameplay ideas they consider unique and interesting.[2] As of 2007, the Simple series has sold over 20 million units across all platforms.[9]

D3 Publisher employs a number of external developers for the series, some of the most prolific being Tamsoft (of Battle Arena Toshinden fame) and HuneX - most are smaller or little-known companies, although several games have been licensed from Taito for a (usually enhanced) re-release.

Certain Simple series titles have attracted considerable interest outside Japan for various reasons, either gameplay quality or a particularly unique idea - these include The OneeChanbara and its sequels, as well as Sandlot's Monster Attack and Global Defence Force, which were based on their Gigantic Drive engine and were of considerably higher quality than most games in the series. Both of these series have had sequels for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console, although they were originally labelled under an "X" moniker (OneChanbara X and Earth Defense Force X) rather than a "Simple" one.
"Japanese PS2 Budget Games Were an Outlet for Pure Insanity"
Early Simple games were generic interpretations of other common video game themes, including tennis, racing, and video board games such as mahjong.[2][3] Beginning with the PlayStation 2, Simple games began using larger genres such as scrolling shooters and role-playing games, in addition to original ideas and concepts. As the games were sold at a low price point and required little development time, developers were able to experiment with gameplay concepts and mechanics.[2] A few entries in the series were released outside Japan by other companies without the brand. After releasing two Simple games for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013,[4] D3 has chosen to remove the Simple name from its budget titles for systems such as the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, though plans to release another entry has been announced for the Switch.[5] In 2022, D3Publisher announced that the Simple Series brand will return for the Nintendo Switch.[6]

Many of the PlayStation 2 Simple 2000 games have been released in PAL regions as budget titles by Midas Interactive Entertainment, Agetec or 505 GameStreet, usually under different titles and with new cover art; recently D3 Publisher of Europe has released several titles itself under the "Essential Games" brand. Additionally, several of the PlayStation Simple 1500 games were released in the US (by Agetec) and Europe (by Midas and Phoenix Games). Despite the recent establishment of D3 Publisher of America, the only games in the Simple series to gain a North American release are The Bass Fishing (as Fisherman's Bass Club), The Genshijin (as The Adventures of Darwin) and OneChanbara for the Xbox 360 and Wii. Simple Series for Wii U Vol.1: The Family Party was released internationally as Family Party: 30 Great Games Obstacle Arcade.

The SIMPLE algorithm was developed by Prof. Brian Spalding and his student Suhas Patankar at Imperial College, London in the early 1970s. Since then it has been extensively used by many researchers to solve different kinds of fluid flow and heat transfer problems.[1]
In computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the SIMPLE algorithm is a widely used numerical procedure to solve the Navier–Stokes equations. SIMPLE is an acronym for Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations.

Many popular books on computational fluid dynamics discuss the SIMPLE algorithm in detail.[2][3] A modified variant is the SIMPLER algorithm (SIMPLE Revised), that was introduced by Patankar in 1979.[4]
The algorithm is iterative. The basic steps in the solution update are as follows:
In 1995, Bob Bishop and Rich Whicker, (both former Apple Computer Engineers) decided to create a new programming language that would be easy enough for everyone to understand and use. (They felt that other existing languages such as C++ and their environments were far too complicated for beginners.) The programming language that they created was called SiMPLE.
Find sources: "SiMPLE" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR
However, aside from a few differences in their outward appearances, writing programs in SiMPLE has a similar "feel" to what one experienced when writing programs in Applesoft. For example, when using SiMPLE in command-line mode, a program is run by simply typing the word "RUN" on a black screen (just as was done on the Apple!)
(a) In "Drag & Drop" mode, the user simply creates a program source listing (a text document), and then runs that program by dragging the source listing document onto a special icon.
SiMPLE (a recursive acronym for SiMPLE Modular Programming Language & Environment) is a programming development system that was created to provide easy programming capabilities for everybody, especially non-professionals.
(b) In "Command-Line" mode, the user creates and runs programs by typing commands and listings into a DOS window.
SiMPLE programs can be run in either "Drag & Drop" mode (intended primarily for beginning programmers), or in "Command-Line" mode (for more advanced programmers):
(a) Micro-SiMPLE is an introductory programming language designed to use only 4 keywords: Call, Set, If, and Goto. An example of a Micro-SiMPLE program listing (and a snapshot of the output display it generates) is shown in the figure below:
(c) Ultra-SiMPLE is the Windows-based version of SiMPLE. It utilizes exactly the same 23 keywords as Pro-SiMPLE. Its graphics capabilities allow millions of colors in whatever resolution the user's system provides. Its sound capabilities allow the user to play any type of media file (including movies).
Another difference between the two languages is in the use of line numbers. Applesoft required them; SiMPLE doesn't even use them. (Instead of typing program statements onto the black Apple screen, SiMPLE uses a text editor.) Furthermore the "FOR-NEXT" loops in Applesoft have been replaced by "Do-Loop" instructions in SiMPLE. (But they function in much the same way).

Prior to 2011 June, SiMPLE was available only for 32-bit computers. Since then, a newer version (which can be used on either 32-bit computers or 64-bit computers) is now the standard version. In this newer version of SiMPLE, the terms "Pro-SiMPLE" and "Ultra-SiMPLE" have been replaced by the terms "Dos-SiMPLE" and "Win-SiMPLE" respectively. However, in an effort to provide as much backward compatibility as possible, both of those obsolete terms ("Ultra-SiMPLE" and "Pro-SiMPLE") are still accepted as being legitimate compiler directives.
SiMPLE is vaguely reminiscent of the AppleSoft BASIC programming language that existed on the old Apple-II computers. However, SiMPLE is not (and was never intended to be) merely a "clone" of Applesoft BASIC. It was merely "inspired" by it. There are many features of Applesoft that needed to be improved. For example, Applesoft was an interpreted language, and so it ran somewhat slowly (even for a 1MHZ processor). SiMPLE, on the other hand, compiles into an executable (.EXE) file. So it not only produces programs that run faster, but those programs can even run on computers that don't have SiMPLE installed.
"Simple" is a generic term for three slightly different versions of the language: Micro-SiMPLE, Pro-SiMPLE, and Ultra-SiMPLE.

In addition, the design of the newer version of SiMPLE is more "streamlined". The old original version of SiMPLE was designed to be used only in the closed environment of Command-line mode. (The "Drag & Drop" mode of operation wasn't added until many years later.) Consequently the old SiMPLE's Command-line mode required dozens of commands (to support such capabilities as deleting source listings, renaming files, creating new project folders, etc.). The newer version of SiMPLE integrates the SiMPLE environment with the Windows environment so that many of the old SiMPLE's Command-line commands are no longer necessary and have been eliminated.
(b) Pro-SiMPLE is the DOS-based version of SiMPLE requiring the use of only 23 keywords. Its graphics capabilities are limited to only 16 colors with a resolution of only 640 x 480 pixels. Its sound capabilities are limited to simple "beeps" through the computer's built-in speaker.
