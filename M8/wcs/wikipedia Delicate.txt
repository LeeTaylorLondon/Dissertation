Damien Rice was previously a member of the band Juniper, and upon its disbandment due to changes in creative direction, he took a sabbatical in rural Italy before returning to Ireland.[1] He would meet with his second cousin, composer David Arnold who was impressed upon hearing Rice's songs and sent Rice's demo to music publishers to no success.Frustrated, Arnold worked with Rice to set up recording equipment for a home studio to make the album independently.[2] He describes receiving a $500 loan from his father that would be forgiven on completion of the album.[3] The recording process included opera singers, Gregorian chants, and a heavy influence from Lisa Hannigan, at the time Rice's personal and professional partner.[1]

Media outlets considered the video's depiction of Swift's invisibility from the crowd an autobiographical reference, given that she had not given press interviews while promoting Reputation.[42] Writing for The Washington Post, Emily Yahr described the video as a representation of Swift's celebrity. Yahr explained that the scenes where Swift appears jaded from the reporters and bodyguards were parallel to Swift's retreat from the press, and called her invisibility a metaphor for "the only time she's able to be herself".[39] Denise Warner from Billboard wrote that the video's depiction of Swift being "clearly disturbed by her fame" resembled the narrative of Britney Spears's 2000 video "Lucky".[43] In another analysis for Billboard, Richard He wrote: "Swift's a singer and guitarist by trade, but through her dancing and facial expressions, she's learned to tell stories with her whole body." According to He, while the lyrics to "Delicate" were inspired by Swift's love life, the video was inspired by her relationship with her audience. He observed that her cathartic, honest, and rather awkward dancing "for the pure joy of music" reminded her audience of "the reason she began writing songs in the first place".[40] The video won Best Music Video at the 2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[44]

Directed by Joseph Kahn, the music video was shot over two nights in Los Angeles; landmarks featured include the Millennium Biltmore Hotel, the 7th Street/Metro Center station, the Los Angeles Theater, and the Golden Gopher bar.[37][38] The video opens with Swift on the red carpet, seeming disconnected from the crowd gazing off in the distance. She snaps back to reality as a reporter points a microphone at her face for an interview.[39] Amidst camera lights, a mysterious figure slips a sparkling paper note into her hand.[40]

Lyrically, Swift conceived "Delicate" as a confession to a prospective lover and described the song—the fifth track on Reputation—as the album's "first point of vulnerability".[12] The preceding four tracks are about Swift's flippant disinterest in her perceived reputation, which is the recurring theme throughout the album. On "Delicate", she begins to reveal her inner vulnerability.[9] During an album release party with iHeartRadio, Swift explained the meaning behind the song: while she could feign disinterest in others' opinions about her, things became complicated "when you meet somebody that you really want in your life", which prompted her to wonder, "Could something fake like your reputation affect something real, like someone getting to know you?"[12] To create a sound that reflects the lyrics' vulnerable sentiment, Martin and Shellback manipulated Swift's vocals with a vocoder, which Swift thought sounded "really emotional, vulnerable, and ... sad but beautiful". This vocoder effect is recurring on subsequent tracks of Reputation.[12]

Upon the video's release, some commentators on the internet accused "Delicate" of plagiarizing an advertisement directed by Spike Jonze in 2016 for "Kenzo World", a fragrance by the French brand Kenzo.[45][46] As noted by Emma Payne—a scholar in music and cinema in the digital era—both visuals depict a woman who "breaks free from the pressures of society and acts freely as though nobody is watching"; to express this sentiment, both feature a choreography made up of unconventional dance moves, such as "marching and stomping" and "animalistic squatting", intertwined with conventional ballet moves. Payne commented that in doing so, the video allows the audience to see the "real" Swift beyond her commercially marketed image. She noted, nonetheless, due to the plagiarism controversy, Swift's persona was scrutinized for being "insincere or fake", a claim that had perpetuated since her earlier "dorky" image.[47]

Swift was a target of tabloid gossip during the promotion of 1989.[6] Her "America's Sweetheart" reputation, a result of her wholesome and innocent image, was blemished from publicized short-lived relationships and disputes with other celebrities, including a dispute with rapper Kanye West and media personality Kim Kardashian.[7][8] Swift became increasingly reticent on social media, having previously maintained an active presence with a large following, and avoided interactions with the press amidst the tumultuous affairs.[9] She conceived her sixth studio album, Reputation, as an answer to the media commotion surrounding her celebrity.[10]

Thrilled by her newfound freedom from fame, Swift starts dancing barefoot through the hotel.[39] Though she seems elated by her invisibility, there are poignant moments—at one scene in an elevator with another woman, Swift thinks that woman is smiling at her, but she is in fact looking at her own reflection in the mirror.[41] Swift continues dancing through a subway platform, and dances in a pouring rain before arriving at a dive bar. As she holds the note, everyone in the bar turns and looks at her, and she is visible again, smiling.[37][39]

Other critics highlighted the song's mellower production and vulnerable sentiment, in contrast to Reputation's heavy electronic production and themes about drama and vengeance. Zach Schonfeld of Newsweek complimented "Delicate" for offering a heartfelt atmosphere in contrast with "the bravado and EDM aggression of the opening tracks".[50] In a similar vein, Troy Smith from The Plain Dealer called it one of the album's better songs because "Swift keeps the mood light".[51] For Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, the song's blending "scathing self-critique with effervescent pop" offers an enjoyable moment that contrasts with the album's dominant "tired, repetitive EDM tricks".[52] Clash editor Shahzaib Hussain criticized Reputation as a pretentious album with excessive lyrics about fame, but praised "Delicate" as one of the tracks that offer emotional honesty.[53] On a less enthusiastic side, Spin's Jordan Sargent wrote that even though the song is one of Reputation's most honest, it is still "unshackled" from the album's recurring themes of drama and vengeance. Sargent, however, noted that production-wise, it contains an "ethereal lusciousness" that hints at "new paths for her to travel".[54]

"Delicate" was a sleeper hit in the US.[63][64] Upon its single release in March 2018, it entered at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 32 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs) chart.[1] By May, the single entered the top 40 of the Hot 100, fueled by gains in airplay, giving Swift her 56th top-40 entry. In doing so, it extended Swift's record as the woman with the most Hot 100 top-40 entries.[65] In its sixteenth charting week by July, "Delicate" rose to the Hot 100's top 20, driven primarily by strong airplay.[66][67] It was the second single from Reputation to enter the top 10 of Billboard's Radio Songs chart (peaking at number two), after lead single "Look What You Made Me Do".[68][69] A radio-driven hit, "Delicate" peaked atop the Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs) chart,[70] and was Reputation's first number-one single on the Billboard Adult Top 40 (Adult Pop Songs)[71] and Adult Contemporary charts.[72] It became the biggest radio hit from Reputation.[66]

"Delicate" is an electropop ballad.[13][14][15][16] The song incorporates dense synthesizers and tropical house-influenced beats.[14][17][18] At the beginning of the song, Swift confesses to her love interest that, because her reputation has "never been worse", "you must like me for me".[19] Critic Carl Wilson from Slate interpreted this part as Swift's revelation on her public image: after the media gossip, she achieved a "liberation" that allowed her to "make her private life her own at last".[20] She shares intimate moments with her love interest at a dive bar "on the East Side".[13][21] Throughout the song, Swift goes through her inner monolog about whether what she does would affect this blossoming romance and how much her feelings would be reciprocated, over a muted pulse: "Is it cool that I said all that? Is it too soon to do this yet? 'Cause I know that it's delicate."[13][22] Though she feigns confidence and tries to control her inner self-awareness, she admits: "I pretend you're mine all the damn time."[23] In the refrain, a high-pitched voice echoes the title "Delicate" back to Swift's lyrics.[24]

Overall, "Delicate" peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, spending a total of 35 weeks on the chart, becoming the longest-charting single from Reputation.[73] The single was one of the 10 most successful songs on US airplay of 2018, culminating 2.509 billion radio audience impressions.[74][note 2] It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which denotes two million units consisted of sales and on-demand streaming.[76] Philip Cosores from Uproxx claimed that the single was Reputation's biggest hit, surpassing the Hot 100 number one "Look What You Made Me Do", which "found a place in cultural ubiquity, but ... felt more like an obligation than an outright choice".[77] Writing for Billboard, Andrew Unterberger described the US chart success of "Delicate" as a "turnaround in momentum" for Swift during the Reputation era. While the preceding singles did not chart more than 20 weeks, "Delicate" continued to grow, especially in airplay, and got "bigger the longer audiences have spent with it". Unterberger attributed the single's success to its vulnerable sentiment and production, a departure from the "outwardly vindictive" sentiments of its preceding singles, which proved that "[the audience] too still like Taylor for Taylor".[66]

"Delicate" received widespread acclaim from music critics, most of whom commended Swift's songwriting. Roisin O'Connor of The Independent described the song as an example of Swift's "most honest and direct songwriting".[37] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine similarly praised Swift's portrayal of vulnerability as "a necessary exercise" for her to mature as a singer-songwriter.[48] Ann Powers writing for NPR called "Delicate" one of Reputation's "most memorable tracks", and described it as a reminder of Swift's songwriting talents in creating personal and relatable songs about her generation's "fashion choices, modes of gossip, dating habits and dreams of a comfortable middle-class life".[49] To explain this viewpoint, Powers highlighted the lyrics mentioning Swift's love interest in Nike shoes: "In 21st-century America, 'Nikes' is as evocative a word as 'heartache' or 'promise.' Swift understands the heart that beats beneath the brand name."[49]
The song's music video, directed by Joseph Kahn and filmed in Los Angeles, premiered on March 11, 2018, at the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards. In the video, after becoming invisible upon receiving a mysterious note, Swift dances barefoot through public places, and ultimately becomes visible again after dancing in a pouring rain. Critics interpreted the video as Swift's autobiographical reference to her personal life, as she had retreated herself from the press while promoting Reputation. A day following the video's release, "Delicate" was released to US radio stations by Big Machine and Republic Records, as the fourth mainstream radio single from the album.[note 1]

"Delicate" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, appearing on her sixth studio album, Reputation (2017). It was written by Swift and its producers, Max Martin and Shellback. Swift described "Delicate" as one of the songs about vulnerability on Reputation, contrary to the album's recurring themes of vengeance and feigned disinterest in her perceived image. The lyrics are about her insecurity in whether her new love interest would be bothered by her blemished reputation. To create a sound accompanying the vulnerable sentiment, Martin and Shellback manipulated Swift's vocals with a vocoder. "Delicate" is an electropop ballad with dense synthesizers and tropical house beats.

Retrospectively, critics have considered "Delicate" one of Swift's strongest songs. Paste's Jane Song,[55] NME's Hannah Mylrae,[18] and Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield all lauded the song's depiction of vulnerability in terms of both lyrics and music, specifically through the vocoder effects.[23] Sheffield ranked it first on his list of the best songs of 2017: "At heart, 'Delicate' is a story about a girl in her room, hearing an electro-beat that lures her to go seek some scandalous adventures in the city lights. In other words, the story of pop music."[56] He ranked "Delicate" fourth on his 2021 ranking of all the 199 songs in Swift's discography.[57] The song featured on 2018 year-end lists by Slant Magazine (9th),[58] Rolling Stone (12th),[15] and Billboard (35th).[59] "Delicate" was one of the award-winning songs at the BMI Pop Awards (2019),[60] and the ASCAP Awards (2019 and 2020).[61][62]

After the red-carpet interviews, Swift walks into a hotel lobby surrounded by four bodyguards as the guests turn around and look at her. Swift is bothered by the attention toward her, and when she gets some privacy in a dressing room, she turns the note over in her hand and makes silly faces in the mirror before being interrupted by a group of women.[39] When she turns back to the mirror, the note sparkles and she realizes she has become invisible as her reflection in the mirror disappears.[39][40]
