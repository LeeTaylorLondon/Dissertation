Grimm was originally developed for CBS, but did not end up moving forward due to the 2007–08 writers' strike. In January 2011, the series moved to NBC. It has been described as "a cop drama—with a twist ... a dark and fantastical project about a world in which characters inspired by Grimms' Fairy Tales exist",[1] though the stories and characters inspiring the show are also drawn from other sources. The series initially garnered mixed reviews from critics, though reception grew more favorable throughout the series' run. The sixth and final season of Grimm premiered on January 6, 2017, and concluded on March 31, 2017.

[And] adds up to a nice, moody, entertaining-enough hour and the troublesome question of how interesting this will be by the third episode."[41]

Damien Puckler as Martin Meisner, a human leader within the resistance group Hadrian's Wall and former friend of Sean Renard. Originally serving as a European operative for Hadrian's Wall, Meisner was tasked with protecting the pregnant Adalind Schade and getting her out of Europe. Meisner eventually becomes the leader of Hadrian's Wall's operations in Portland, and recruits both Eve and Trubel into the organization. Meisner is killed in the season 5 finale after Sean Renard leads Conrad Bonaparte and Black Claw to the Hadrian's Wall base, where the Wesen kill all those inside. Renard then shoots his former friend in the head to end his suffering at the hand of the Zauberbiest Bonaparte. Following his death, Meisner appears as a manifestation of Captain Renard's guilt for betraying his friends, but the manifestation saves Renard's life by warning him of an ambush and obscuring the vision of one of the ambushers proving to be more than a manifestation.

Daynah Burnett, who reviewed the program for PopMatters, felt "[a]s Grimm grasps for compelling analogues between fairy tales' villains and ours, its stories turn exceedingly literal: wolves urinate in the corners of their lawns to mark their territory, rather than lurk (and mark) in ways less obvious and more culturally meaningful. There's certainly room here for these archetypes to be explored as the series develops, but when Nick's prime suspect for the red-hoodie crimes turns out to live in an actual cottage in the woods, it doesn't bode well for how these stories might reflect the lives of viewers", before giving it a score of 4 out of 10.[42]

Pinface's Unnamed Sister - Used to be best friends with her brother, Pinface, when they were kids, met her at the Netherworld Mall, but later broke up with her because her 'pinhead' bowling pins kept poking him in the eye whenever he tried to kiss her.
His Scythe - Grim has a very strong attachment to it, even naming it "Jodie" ("The Taking Tree"), and kissing it (Billy & Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure). Grim loves his scythe (first and foremost), and his job, and was once sent to anger management because he loves his job "a little too much" ("Anger Mismanagement").

The Secret Decoder Ring: In a flashback in this episode, Grim is seen in ordinary clothes as a child and not in his robes.
While the position of the Grim Reaper is a privileged one, Grim is not immune from punishment for misuse of his power, as seen in Home of the Ancients when he had used his powers to pull the moon out of orbit and used it as a bowling ball for Billy and Mandy.
Grim was originally supposed to be voiced by Jonathan Harris and be given a British accent, but Greg Eagles was hired instead. Also, Eagles' initially voiced the character imitating Trinidadian actor Geoffrey Holder, which supposedly sounded more Jamaican. The writers then decided to just let Grim have a Jamaican accent instead.[1]

Atrocia - A TV horror show hostess, (parody of Elvira: Mistress of the Dark).
Lubber - Not a romantic love interest of Grim's per-say, but Grim was her romantic love interest, she would follow him everywhere back at school and started to eat anyone who made fun of Grim, after eating most of the school's student body, Lubber was banished by the school principal to guard the 'secret of the universe'. She then tricked everyone and then pushed Mindy so that she protects what she used to.
Grim is the Grim Reaper, a privileged title, role, and position within The Underworld. Armed with the Reaper's Scythe, Grim come to collect those whose time has come and escorts them to the 'other side', in other words, Grim's occupation is primary as a psychopomp: In Schlubs, Grim comments upon how he used to charge two coins for ferrying souls across the River Styx. But Grim also has power over life and death, as he is able to extend someone's life, (as seen in Jeffy's Web,) and can be challenged to stop someone from dying (as seen in Meet the Reaper). On the darker side, and more biblical of the role of the Grim Reaper, Grim, as Death, and armed with the scythe, is meant to "carve a swath of despair and destruction through the world of men, to blacken the skies and redden the seas, leaving nothing behind but entropy and uncomfortable silence...".
In Billy and Mandy vs. the Martians, it is shown that, apparently, there is a 'Reaper' for other planets, such as Mars, Mercury, Venus, and Uranus. The Martian Grim Reaper is called Morg.

The scene for the quote, however, is incorrect. The scene is from the same play, Hamlet (specifically "Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him, Horatio." from Act 5 Scene 1) whereas the quote he gives is from Act 1, Scene 1.
In Schlubs, Grim comments upon how he used to charge two coins for ferrying souls across the River Styx as a reference to ancient Greek mythology
Grim is also in possession of a Magical Trunk, larger on the inside than it is on the outside, Grim stores a menagerie of sinister, evil, and, more importantly, dangerous magical objects for safekeeping. A handful of episodes show the calamities that follow when Billy, having unheeded Grim's instruction not to do so, opens and takes things out of Grim's trunk.
Possibly because of his profession as the Grim Reaper, Grim has the power to extend any living thing's lifetime by adding sand to their hourglass (shown to be manufactured by Father Time) which he does to Jeff (so that he can keep scaring Billy, stating that while, he doesn't like spiders, he loves watching Billy wet his pants).
Grim's voice actor is Greg Eagles in the series (who also voices Sperg), but in Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion, it is Neil Kaplan.

Over time though, Grim grew to genuinely care about the kids. This is shown in instances where he's been given a chance to be free from them, but ends up not taking it. In most cases, Grim seems to prefer being with Billy more than Mandy, since Billy's generally much kinder and friendlier towards him than Mandy, although one thing he and Mandy have in common is that they both have similar personality traits and how they tend to get annoyed with Billy's stupidity (which they both take advantage of at times). Some examples showing Grim's genuine care for Billy and Mandy is when he challenges Nergal to a fight for Billy and Mandy's lives, helping Billy overcome his fear of clowns, and helping Mandy get her nerve back. Despite this, Grim is always in a constant battle of the mind in many episodes on whether he feels like getting rid of Billy and Mandy or saving them which he does both mixing it up every other episode.
Velma Green - Grim's former best friend from high school, who lost all love and respect for him because she thought he had cheated to become the Grim Reaper. Their strong and close friendship was renewed after the events of Wrath of the Spider Queen when Velma learned the truth. Despite Grim having feelings for Velma, he seemed to be okay with her marrying Jeff.
As a supernatural undead being of the Underworld, Grim naturally has tremendously powerful supernatural abilities of his own, such as being able to grow in size and elongate his form and the ability to possess the living, (as seen in 'Get Out of My Head"). As an undead, talking magical skeleton, Grim is a complete animated skeleton of bones that is able to function both as a complete skeleton or independently as individual bones. Grim has also been seen creating flames whenever his tempers flares, even his eyes will shoot out flames when he gets angry or determined. It can also be seen that Grim has telekinesis. He used this when he flew the Chupricabra tape into his hand out of the VCR.
Beyond this, Grim has demonstrated the use of spells in earlier episodes; consulting with Underworld editions of books and manuals of magic, (such as in Tickle Me Mandy when Mandy went away for a day, Grim used some of Billy's toys to make a 'Mandy-Substitute' to keep Billy company). Grim owns copies of many Underworld tomes, such as "The Bad Book", the "Destruction Manual", "The New Jersey Book of the Dead", and "The Monster Manual - vol 1".
Grim made a cameo in the OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes episode, Crossover Nexus, where he appears as one of the Cartoon Network heroes that were summoned and defeated by Strike. Grim later appears as one of Ben Tennyson's transformations to defeat Strike. He can also be seen in the episode "Monster Party", on the cover of Teen Scare magazine.
I am the Grim Reaper! Master of the forces of life and death!!
Other things that Grim hates are elderly people, health freaks, the community, community service, neighbors (and new neighbors even more so), false alarms while he's at work, anytime that Billy and Mandy mix his professional life with their personal life, whenever Billy goes through his trunk or robe pockets, and when Mandy makes him do her chores. It appears that he has met a giant monster named Cragera.
Grim is also shown to be very sensitive to insults, especially "yo mama"-type insults where his feeling are shown to be hurt when Mr. Goodbling or Billy made Yo Mama jokes onto him or when Sperg insulted him for being a skeleton. When Billy called Grim stupid after saying the rented video was stupid. Grim also usually doesn't miss the opportunity to laugh in a sinister manner whenever he witnesses the suffering of others.
Being a skeleton also gave him a natural talent for limbo, as he can bend in ways the living can not.
In a commercial for the premiere episode of Grim & Evil, Grim claims to be the ruler of the Underworld.
Despite hating Mandy and being treated like a slave, he has more things in common with her than with Billy (although Billy tends to be nicer to Grim than Mandy).
Growing up, Grim has considered King Dracula his boyhood idol.
Grim's age is hard to pin down; in A Grim Prophecy, it shows an account of how Grim became the 'Grim Reaper' depicts Grim's early childhood taking place during the time of Neanderthal Man, putting Grim's age at around 137,000 years old in human years. In Wrath of the Spider Queen, it was shown that he was in his preteens in around the same time period, and that dinosaurs and cavemen were around then, which supports the same timeline. However, in Dad Day Afternoon, Grim says that it's been 1.4 million years since he became the "Grim Reaper".
Grim is also seen with his scythe, an object of tremendous magical energy and power in the series and the source of most of Grim's abilities and powers. Though he does possess telekinesis.
Malaria - A Goth woman who Grim first met at a beach. She later freaked out when she found out that he was the real Grim Reaper.
The Grim Reaper (or just Grim) is the titular main protagonist of the 2003 Cartoon Network animated TV series The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy. He is an undead skeleton personification/manifestation of Death, who speaks with a Jamaican accent. After having lost to Billy and Mandy after Mandy cheated in a limbo contest over the soul of Mr. Snuggles (and also the soul of Billy himself), Grim is now forced to be their best friend forever. If Grim does not live up to his commitment, he will be stripped of his powers and be forced to spend eternity in Underworld Jail.
Grim's Black Robe is also magical, aside from being able to expand along with him whenever he shapeshifts, Grim's robe has been seen as sustaining damage and then seen again intact. In Sickly Sweet, it is revealed that aside from keeping cursed objects within his trunk, Grim explained to Billy that he also keeps "terrible, cursed objects", such as magical metal gloves, or "The Mask of the Beast" in the pockets of his robe.
King Tooten Pooten: In this episode in season 7, Grim muses over his time as an intern for Osiris, God of the Egyptian Afterlife, before he became the Grim Reaper.
Grim was bullied in high school by the Boogeyman and lots of his friends, namely one event was when he was wedgied whilst reciting Shakespeare's Hamlet.The scene for the quote, however, is incorrect. The scene is from the same play, Hamlet (specifically "Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him, Horatio." from Act 5 Scene 1) whereas the quote he gives is from Act 1, Scene 1.The quote was ironically parodied, as Grim, being a skeleton, held a human head, whereas in the actual play, a human actor holds a skull.
A Grim Prophecy: In this episode, Grim is shown as having been forced into the role of the Grim Reaper by both his parents, further supporting that Grim's position as the Grim Reaper is hereditary.
Grim's appearance stays true to the iconic image of the Grim Reaper; Grim is depicted in the series as an adult-sized 'undead, talking magical skeleton'. Grim is most often seen wearing a long black robe with red on the inside with a hood. His ID says he's 6'6" and 77 pounds.
Wrath of the Spider Queen: In this story it's shown that, 137,000-years earlier, Grim was elected to the role of the Grim Reaper by his classmates after his display of supernatural powers with the scythe.
Throughout the series, Grim has been attracted to many one-shot female characters.
Lil' Porkchop: In this episode, when Grim shows Mandy a picture of his old pet skeleton fish, called "Chudney", the picture also shows Grim as a preteen in his traditional foreboding black robes, supporting the back story that Grim's position as the Grim Reaper is hereditary.
In the episode The Halls of Time, Grim is seen having a very special sand timer, larger than regular humans, and full of Black Sand. In the episode Duck!, Grim explains to Billy that, as the Grim Reaper, Grim cannot have good dreams. If Grim has good dreams, then a vortex would open in the back of his skull, giving all manner of unsavory ‘bugaboo’s access to the human world. In the episode Scythe 2.0, Grim can go to F, a humanoid, Q-like character in the Underworld who is responsible for repairing the scythe. In The Love that Dare Not Speak Its Name, Grim's profession is touched upon as less about reaping a person whose time has come, as Grim is shown explaining to Billy that "the first rule to a successful reaping is selection".
5.1 Becoming the Grim Reaper5.1.1 Evidence that It Is Hereditary5.1.2 Evidence that It Is Not Hereditary
Described by the series creator Maxwell Atoms as 'cantankerous', Grim is unsatisfied being stuck as Billy and Mandy's 'best friend/slave'. It is implied he is easily tricked, as he was tricked by two children into being their friend/slave, tricked by Boogey into falling for his own prank, and tricked by Jack O'Lantern, and had his scythe stolen from him many times. But that doesn't change the fact that he is a very dangerous and powerful being. This was shown very clearly during his encounter with A-Bom the Yeti and various other individuals.
6 Supernatural Abilities6.1 The Grim Reaper's Scythe6.2 Other Magical Artifacts6.3 Unrelated to his Profession
Several conflicting accounts and a number of clues have been given as to how Grim first came to be The Grim Reaper:
Born and raised in the Underworld, Grim attended Doomsday Junior High School with supernatural entities and other characters of the show, such as Eris, Nergal, Lord Pain, and The Boogeyman. Grim was unfortunate enough to be stuck as the favorite target of the school bully, Boogey, who enjoyed making the lives of the other students (Grim in particular) as miserable as possible. Grim played Underworld Little League as a child and was also a member of the 'Dead Poets Club' during junior high. But, thanks to Boogie's antics, Grim was labeled with the nickname of "Wedgie Shakespeare" for the rest of school. Despite this, a few of Grim's classmates have stayed on good terms with him, such as Velma Green, his very best friend, and Lubber (sort of). In Billy and Mandy Save Christmas, Grim mentions that he went to College with Santa Claus.
For full information on this subject, see The Reaper's Scythe
The quote was ironically parodied, as Grim, being a skeleton, held a human head, whereas in the actual play, a human actor holds a skull.
For some reason, Grim can close his eye sockets and make complex facial expressions, despite the fact that his face is solid bone.
Dad Day Afternoon: In this episode in season 6, Grim is shown as becoming the Grim Reaper after coming across the scythe randomly, unbeknownst to his father, whom Grim lead to believe that he had become a Country Western Rocker. Grim also says that it's been 1.4 million years since he became the "Grim Reaper".
First and foremost, Grim loves his scythe and his job, and was once sent to anger management because he loves his job "a little too much". Grim enjoys Ice Cream and Chocolate, his favorite part of the newspapers are the obituaries and his favorite time of the year is "El Día de los Muertos"--it's the only day of the year that is dedicated solely to him.
Eris - Grim had a huge romantic crush on her early in the series, during her 'valley girl' phase.
Grim also love to play Golf and Mini golf--he has an excellent golf-swing technique--as well as any sport that involves swinging a stick, such as Baseball. Grim's favorite dance is The Skeleton Dance--but hates having to dance it with amateurs.
As the Grim Reaper, Grim is the "Master of the Forces of Life and Death" and the owner of 'The Reaper's Scythe'; an Underworld object of enormous magical strength and power, (other such objects of power include, Eris' Apple of Discord, Pandora's Box, and Horror the Ancient's 'Left Hand of Horror'). All the most prominent of Grim's powers stem from this scythe. For the most point, Grim is dependent upon the scythe in the series for his powers and is usually rendered powerless when disarmed, but has been seen shown as capable of magical feats without it.
In Grim & Evil, Grim's voice was more deep and scary, but his voice became louder over time.
It could be implied that because Grim takes souls to the Underworld, this is why his favorite game is limbo.
Billy and the Bully: In this episode, Grim's mother is seen in silhouette, in the same foreboding robes as Grim, hinting that the position of the Grim Reaper is hereditary.
He is also occasionally depicted with a tongue in varying colours (usually purple or green) and states of decomposition.
Grim is often stuck with cleaning up the consequences of mishaps that are in no small part due to Billy's stupidity and lack of common sense. On Mandy's part, Grim is often forced to do her chores and obey her direct orders, as her unwilling slave. It is stated several times in the series that he does the dishes every single day for Billy and Mandy ever since they first met, whom he genuinely despises for using him as a friend-slave.
Originally a resident of The Underworld, Grim is an 'Undead, talking, magical skeleton', along with the rest of his family: So far, Grim has been identified as having a father, (named "Earl" in passing,) a mother, (also only named in passing as "Miriam",) a grandmother known simply as "Granny-Grim", and a Great Aunt called "Aunt Kali", (named for the Hindu Goddess of the same name). Grim's mother has been heard speaking Jamaican accent like Grim does, along with Granny-Grim.
Grim also has ownership of the original Hellhound, of Greek myth; a massive, three-headed 'Demon-Dog' called Cerberus. How Grim ever came to own Cerberus was never addressed during the series, but it was evident in Cerberus' debut that Grim couldn't control him, claiming that Cerberus, "didn't just eat [Grim's] homework, [Cerberus] also ate [Grim's Dad]", (though it was probably just an exaggeration on the script writer's part).

Grim's Arrival Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cartoon Network-1
Grim dislikes Billy, Mandy, and Irwin and often fantasizes about their gruesome deaths, releasing him from their company forever. In Billy and Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure, Grim confirms that as much as he hates Billy, Mandy, and Irwin, his hatred of Boogie far overshadows his hatred of them, driving Grim to go through the "Cannibal Run" to get Horror's Hand before Boogie. Grim also reveals that Horror's Hand can't affect him because he lives his worst nightmares every day - being stuck with Billy, Mandy, and Irwin as their 'friend slave'. Grim also keeps a voodoo doll of Billy in his trunk. If Grim doesn’t live up to his deal with the kids, he will end up in Underworld Jail and be removed of his assets and powers (including his scythe).
Bully Boogey: In a flashback in this episode, Grim is seen in ordinary clothes as a child and not in his black robes.
The hilt on Grim's scythe disappears and appears randomly, sometimes there like a conventional scythe, sometimes not.
Grim admits that he used to play "that 'Stairway-to-Heaven' thing" back during high school and is very good at playing the guitar, (or bad depending on one’s interpretation, seeing as when he once played 'Stairway to Heaven' out in the street, it sounded good, but it also tore down the surrounding neighborhood.) Grim played the lead guitar position for Sperg's garage band, Purple Filth, for their entry in the Endsville 'Battle of the Bands', (see Battle of the Bands).
Grim always has at least $50 on his person at any given time.
Grim is apparently the only person immune to the Hand of Horror. This is due to the fact that, since being forced to befriend Billy and Mandy, he has to 'live his worst nightmares every day' and so the hand doesn't show him anything new.

Besides having written numerous books Shirley was lead singer of the punk band Sado-Nation, in 1978-79; he was lead singer of the post-punk funk-rock band Obsession, on Celluloid Records, while living in New York City and Paris, France, in the 1980s, and was later in the band the Panther Moderns. He is currently performing with The Screaming Geezers. Shirley has also written 23 song lyrics recorded by Blue Öyster Cult.

Shirley's cyberpunk novels are City Come A-Walkin, the A Song Called Youth trilogy and Stormland. Avant-slipstream critic Larry McCaffery called him "a postmodern Edgar Allan Poe."[3] Bruce Sterling has cited Shirley's early story collection Heatseeker as being a seminal cyberpunk work in itself. Several stories in Heatseeker were particularly seminal, including Sleepwalkers, which, in just one example, probably provided the inspiration for William Gibson's "meat puppets" in Neuromancer. Gibson acknowledged Shirley's influence in an introduction to Shirley's City Come A-Walkin. Shirley's story collection, made up of increasingly bizarre stories, the whimsically titled Really, Really, Really, Really Weird Stories has developed a cult status.

Other recent novels are Halo: Broken Circle, Doyle After Death and a novelization of Mark Tremonti's science-fiction rock opera, A Dying Machine.
William Gibson, the author of Neuromancer, collaborated with Shirley on short stories—as did fellow cyberpunks Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker. Shirley's lyricism, wealth of ideas and imagination, crossover pioneering, and street-level honesty have been praised by other writers including Clive Barker, Peter Straub, Roger Zelazny, Marc Laidlaw, and A. A. Attanasio. His more surreal work, as in A Splendid Chaos, showed how it was possible to describe the indescribable with a paradoxical believability and impeccable internal logic no matter how bizarre the subject matter. Shirley's personal experiences as a recovering drug addict and punk rocker brought verisimilitude to his darker, urban-tinctured writing.

Nick discovers that the missing finger matches Lena's fingerprint. He, Hank, and other police officers raid her house, but she has already left and is in a boat, about to kill her third victim. Nick arrives and is attacked by Lena, but she gets caught in a net and is detained. While taking the daughter to live with her grandmother, Nick sees that she too is a Spinnetod. In her cell, Lena is beginning to age rapidly.
"Tarantella" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a "B" grade and wrote, "Well, so much for consistency. I knew Grimm would take a bit of a dive after a series-best episode last week, and I knew better than to expect some forward development on the plot, but shows like this tend to operate on the assumption that after a handful of standalone plots, somewhere in the episode order is a very serialized one that moves the story along. Right now Grimm doesn't do that, and even a pretty cool case-of-the-week didn't abate my questions this week."[2]

Nick and Hank are sent to investigate the murder and while inspecting the sewers, Wu (Reggie Lee) finds the worker's leg. In his backpack, many items from the robbed houses are revealed, linking the murderer to the man killed in the house. The examination also reveals that the marks belong to that of an alligator. Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) suggests that the killer is a Gelumcaedus. Along with Rosalee (Bree Turner) and Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch), Nick and Hank find that the Gelumcaedus are ancient creatures who protected the sewers.

But for the pit confounders, let them go, and find as little mercy as they show!
Adalind (Claire Coffee) meets with Prince Viktor Chlodwig zu Schellendorf von Konigsburg (Alexis Denisof), Eric's replacement. Viktor wants to find out who killed Eric and also says that he is Renard's (Sasha Roiz) cousin. Adalind tells him about Renard and also about Nick (David Giuntoli), identifying him as a Grimm. Back in Portland, a man named Gregorek (Matthew Willig) breaks into a house and begins to rob it. Someone enters the house and Gregorek kills him using his Wesen form.
Like the next episode, the episode was viewed by 4.88 million people, earning a 1.2/4 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking second on its timeslot and sixth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Last Man Standing, Blue Bloods, 20/20, Undercover Boss, and Shark Tank.[1] This was a 23% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 6.32 million viewers with a 1.6/5.[2] This means that 1.2 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With DVR factoring in, the episode was watched by 8.22 million viewers with a 2.6 ratings share in the 18-49 demographics.[3]
Acquiring a map, Nick and Hank find that the sewers connect to all the robberies in the area. They travel to the sewers where they are attacked by a Gelumcaedus. Hank manages to knock him with a rifle and it woges back to his human form, revealed to be Gregorek, who says: "Dēcapitāre". In Vienna, Renard, Meisner and Sebastien arrive at the meeting with Frenay, who is executing a man for betraying them and tells Meisner to kill him. In the station, Nick and Hank try to make Gregorek confess but he refuses. Nick learns from Rosalee that the word "Dēcapitāre" means "he who decapitates" in Latin.

"Cold Blooded" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a "B+" grade and wrote, "The breadcrumb approach to revealing the larger story at play makes me far less interested in where the bigger story is going. At this rate, it will take the entire length of the series for anything significant to actually happen. The villains in these plots haven't been an immediate threat other than briefly at the midpoint and end of the second season, with Nick's confrontation with his captain and Eric's attempt to kidnap Nick back to Europe."[4]

Deutsche Sagen. Herausgegeben von den Brüdern Grimm, Berlin (1816) (google books)
Deutsche Sagen followed the 1812 publication of Kinder- und Hausmärchen (known in English as Grimms' Fairy Tales). It never gained the wide popular appeal and influence of the latter, although it did influence the scholarly study of folk narrative.
Numbers 505–514 group a number of Swiss entries, including Radbot von Habsburg (505), Rudolf von Strättlingen (506), Idda von Toggenburg (507), Auswanderung der Schweizer (508), Der Bund im Rütli (511) and Wilhelm Tell (512).
A number of the stories record medieval antisemitic beliefs held by Germanic-speaking peoples. For example, The Jews' Stone, The Girl Who Was Killed by Jews, and Pfefferkorn the Jew at Halle, among others.[2]

The second volume (entries numbered 363–579) focusses on historical legends, including numerous translations from Latin sources pertaining to Germanic antiquity, beginning with Tacitus (no 363. Der heilige Salzfluß "the sacred salt-river", Annales XIII. 57), spanning both medieval legend(e.g. no. 576. Hungersnoth im Grabfeld "famine in Grabfeld", Annales Fuldenses ad ann. 850) and early modern folkloristic records (e.g. no. 579 Die Gräfin von Orlamünde "the countess of Orlamünde", attributed to Wolfgang Lazius de migratione gentium libri VII in the edition ofWaldenfels, antiquitatis selectae libri XII 1677, 4.465-474), blurring the lines between oral folk tradition and literary tradition.
The first volume contains 362 short tales, provided in short summary with a source. The source is in some cases "oral", with the region where it was collected (as in no. 1, Die drei Bergleute im Kuttenberg "the three miners in Kuttenberg", marked "oral" from Hessen), in other cases with a reference to the tale's previous publication (as in no. 362, Die drei Alten "The three old men", attributed to "Schmidt aus Lübek",im Freimüthigen 1809. Nr. 1.) The tales of the first volume tend to blend common concerns of the poor and working classes with magical realism including the attainment of wealth and status, and includes references to Frau Holle, the Wild Hunt, ghostly apparitions, and magic, the devil, dwarves, giants, kobolds, nixes, etc.Less than a dozen folk tales contain the German word for witch or witchcraft (hexen) but there are many mentions of the devil and one tale (#120) also mentions an old woman that was a magician or sorceress (ein altes Weib, das eine Zauberin war).[1]

Deutsche Sagen ("German Legends") is a publication by the Brothers Grimm, appearing in two volumes in 1816 and 1818. The collection includes 579 short summaries of German folk tales and legends (where "German" refers not just to German-speaking Europe generally but includes early Germanic history as well).

Out they scampered from doors, windows and gutters, rats of every size, all after the piper.
"Danse Macabre" received mixed-to-positive reviews. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a "okay" 6.0 out of 10 and wrote "I like this digging into traditional fairytales and turning them on their heads. It definitely makes me think about the darker side of all those familiar bedtime stories, but something is still off. I can't place it, but they're missing beats. I think Grimm is a bit like the kid who has infinite potential but can't seem to apply him/herself. It's still an entertaining show, but it could be so much more."[2]

Roddy meets with Sarah Jennings (Amelia Rose Blair), one of Lawson's students, and tells her that her friends placed the pest control cages to frame him and his dad for the murder. Meanwhile, Hank and Wu go to a bar, where Hank leaves Wu and talks to Adalind Schade (Claire Coffee), while Renard (Sasha Roiz) watches from his car. Nick sends Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) to talk to Roddy and encourage him to stay calm and develop his musical talents. Monroe thinks it went well, but after he leaves, Roddy is notified his father has been injured in jail after refusing to enter his cell. Roddy becomes enraged and starts trashing the place.

The episode was broadcast on Thursday December 8, instead of Friday. It was viewed by 4.09 million people, earning a 1.6/4 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, marking a 25% decrease in viewership and ranking second in its timeslot and twelfth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Parks and Recreation, Whitney, America's Funniest Home Videos, Wipeout, Bones, The Mentalist, Person of Interest, The Office, The X Factor, Rules of Engagement and The Big Bang Theory.[1] This means that 1.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 4 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it.
TV Overmind's Shilo Adams wrote, "When talking about Grimm's last original episode (which aired in mid-November), I mentioned how badly I wanted the show to fully embrace its dark side, which features a lot of horror movie instincts. What has made Grimm such an interesting show to watch is how visually distinctive it is from (almost) everything else on TV and the show really asserts itself as something different when it piles on the dingy lighting, unique make-up/CGI, and intricately creepy details that keep its other worldly feel alive and kickin'. Simply, allowing Grimm to become a sort-of monster-movie-of-the-week could make for some fun TV."[4]
"Danse Macabre" is the 5th episode of the supernatural drama television series Grimm of season 1, which premiered on December 8, 2011, on NBC. The episode was written by series creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf, and was directed by David Solomon.The episode was named for the symphonic poem Danse macabre, a piece of music played at several places in the episode by both the Reinigen Roddy Geiger and others.
The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a "B" grade and wrote, "Even though I'm warming up to Grimm and laughing at some nice one-liners while I enjoy the fairy tale retellings, those big questions from the pilot are still floating somewhere in the back of my mind. Personally, I find it easy to disregard the overarching questions when Nick and Hank are investigating a case on their own, or whenever Eddie Monroe shows up. But whenever Captain Renard slinks in (and he was in the background of a few scenes tonight), it always highlights that there is a glass ceiling on this show that feels impenetrable at the moment because the show continues to ignore the lingering big questions inherent in the premise and pilot episode. No matter how compellingly the fractured fairy tales unfold, there was a lot of backstory in that first hour that has only reappeared in flashes. 'Beeware,' the best episode of the series so far, managed to tell a story related to the creature world Nick was discovering while he and Hank investigated a case, but no other episode has struck the right blend since."[3]
Opening quote: "Out they scampered from doors, windows and gutters, rats of every size, all after the piper."
Roddy takes his DJ mask and leaves with the rats for a warehouse party. Sarah and her friends arrive and Roddy plays his violin to send the rats after them. Nick and Hank arrive in time to rescue them. They finally admit that they used the rats to intimidate Professor Lawson and to frame Roddy. Nick finds Roddy but lets him go. Nick and Hank decide to leave the case as there's no believable evidence for an arrest. The episode ends as a repairman (a disguised creature), arrives at Nick's home to retrieve his tools, which he had been using to repair the fridge. He is clearly frightened of Nick, which confuses Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch).
DJ "Retchid Kat" performs at a rave. Meanwhile, music professor Paul Lawson is killed in his car when rats attack him. Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are sent to investigate and discover "Geiger Pest Control" cages hidden nearby, leading them to question if they brought the rats there. While questioning Lawson's students, they learn that one of Lawson's students, Roddy Geiger (Nick Thurston), had been suspended for bad behaviour. They question Roddy and his father, but the pair resist and are arrested. Nick finds out they are Reinigen. Sgt. Wu (Reggie Lee) finds out that Roddy is "Retchid Kat", and since he was at the rave the night Lawson died, he is released. An autopsy reveals that Lawson died from a heart attack before the rats could kill him.
Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.9 star rating out of 5, stating: "After what feels like months off the air, Grimm gave us 'Danse Macabre' this week, which brought the Pied Piper into the picture. And, while it was awesome to see this original, deadmaus-esque take, I was left, once again, wanting more. However, there was some improvement from 'Lonelyhearts,' in that there was less sprinkling of overarching plot and a much greater effort in working the overall story go forward. Even if that means it has to involve the forever boring Juliette."[5]

The standalone lowest-rated game of all time is Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, with an 8.[26] There are eleven movies that have received a 1, including Bio-Dome, 10 Rules for Sleeping Around, Chaos, Inappropriate Comedy, Not Cool, The Singing Forest, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, Death of a Nation, Hardbodies, Mother's Day and United Passions.[27] The standalone lowest-rated TV show of all time is The 1/2 Hour News Hour, with a 13.[28] The standalone lowest-rated album of all time is Playing with Fire by Kevin Federline, with a 15.[29]
Some have noted that Metacritic scores for modern video games may not be accurately reflective of a game's state in the future due to post release updates and patches as well as most press reviews of games taking place around its launch. For example, the metascore for MediEvil (2019) was mixed mainly due to performance issues around the time of the game's launch. These issues were fixed in post-release patches that make the game run smoothly, which would have led to a higher metascore in its current state.[44] Another example is online games such as Final Fantasy XIV Online and Warframe, which received mixed scores initially but became more well-received following improvements made after launch.[45]

Games Editor Marc Doyle was interviewed in 2008 by Keith Stuart of The Guardian to "get a look behind the metascoring process". Stuart wrote: "The Metascore phenomenon, namely Metacritic and GameRankings, have become an enormously important element of online games journalism over the past few years".[9] Doyle said that because video games lead to a greater investment of time and money, gamers are more informed about reviews than are fans of film or music; they want to know "whether that hotly anticipated title is going to deliver".[9]

At the end of 2012, Four began screening some new episodes of shows within seven days of the show being broadcasting in the United States under the Fast Four brand. Examples of shows include The Simpsons, Family Guy, Glee and How I Met Your Mother. New Zealand TV networks typically start screening most US television series around five months after the original release, usually first screening in late January or February at the end of the New Zealand summer, catching up to the US at the end of the season as all 22 episodes are broadcast week-after-week, not spread out over nine months as in the US. The transition of shows like Glee from TV3 to Four also lost the NZ On Air funding that is given to TV3 to get EIA-608 captions converted from source masters to the preferred Teletext format by TVNZ's Access Services. As New Zealand broadcasters are completely reliant on this process for program subtitling.

Four (stylised as FOUR; formerly TV4) was the second New Zealand television channel owned and operated by MediaWorks New Zealand, broadcast via the state-owned Kordia transmission network. The channel launched on 29 June 1997 as TV4 and was replaced by C4 on 3 October 2003. It was relaunched on 6 February 2011 as a separate channel from C4.
"MEDIAWORKS TV ANNOUNCES FOUR PLUS 1". 29 May 2014. Archived from the original on 23 June 2016.
The history of Four dates back to 1997 when TV3 decided to launch a second TV channel called TV4. TV4 was an entertainment network and screened a wide range of imported shows such as South Park, Beverly Hills 90210, Beavis and Butthead. After 2000, new programming was scarce, with the infiltration of 1980's and 1990's repeats. On October 3, 2003, TV4 was replaced by music channel C4.
In general, the channel's target audience was 18- to 49-year-olds and could be broader in its appeal, with programming which attracted a wider, and more mature audience. During early mornings and late afternoons the channel screened a range of children's programming such as Sesame Street and in the evenings screened shows aimed at the mainstream audience. Overnight and late mornings – early afternoons the channel screened Infomercials and Auto TV (Car Commercials). Four broadcast mostly American programming, with the exception of Sticky TV, Four Live, and Smash, which were in-house produced Auckland-hosted youth shows, and the Pukana youth show, which was produced from a Maori language government fund. Pukana also airs on one of the two government funded Maori language channels.

Four Plus 1 was a timeshift service that MediaWorks launched on 27 June 2014. It was a standard hour-delayed timeshift channel of the Four broadcast. Four Plus 1 was initially only available on digital terrestrial with satellite launched a week later on Sky's fifth digital transport.[2] It was replaced by Bravo Plus 1 on 3 July 2016, when Bravo replaced Four.
On 6 February 2011, TV4 returned as Four. MediaWorks announced this in October 2010, and said that the new network would focus on children's programming during the day and in the evenings will screen a range of shows aimed at the 18- to 49-year-old audience. The first programme to air on Four was The Simpsons episode "Elementary School Musical" (not coincidentally featuring New Zealand band Flight of the Conchords).
The final ever show to air on FOUR was The Biggest Loser. At 10:50 pm on Saturday 2 July 2016, the channel closed with Feist singing "1234" (the same Sesame Street song that was used to relaunch the channel back in February 2011); the channel then faded to black.
