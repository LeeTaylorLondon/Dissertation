A formal grammar (also called formation rules) is a precise description of the well-formed formulas of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean).
The theorem is a syntactic consequence of all the well-formed formulas preceding it in the proof. For a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus (of some formal system) to the previous well-formed formulas in the proof sequence.

A formal system (also called a logical calculus, or a logical system) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a deductive system). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called inference rules) or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions.

An interpretation of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and truth values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called formal semantics. Giving an interpretation is synonymous with constructing a model.
In logic and mathematics, a formal proof or derivation is a finite sequence of sentences (called well-formed formulas in the case of a formal language), each of which is an axiom, an assumption, or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a rule of inference. It differs from a natural language argument in that it is rigorous, unambiguous and mechanically verifiable.[1] If the set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a theorem of the formal system. The notion of theorem is not in general effective, therefore there may be no method by which we can always find a proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists. The concepts of Fitch-style proof, sequent calculus and natural deduction are generalizations of the concept of proof.[2][3]

Formal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in interactive theorem proving (e.g., through the use of proof checker and automated theorem prover).[4] Significantly, these proofs can be checked automatically, also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, while the problem of finding proofs (automated theorem proving) is usually computationally intractable and/or only semi-decidable, depending upon the formal system in use.

A formal language is a set of finite sequences of symbols. Such a language can be defined without reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning. Formal proofs are expressed in some formal languages.

In the mid-20th century, mathematics was broadened and enriched by the rise of new mathematical sciences and engineering disciplines such as operations research and systems engineering. These sciences benefited from basic research in electrical engineering and then by the development of electrical computing, which also stimulated information theory, numerical analysis (scientific computing), and theoretical computer science. Theoretical computer science also benefits from the discipline of mathematical logic, which includes the theory of computation.[citation needed]
A formal science is a branch of science studying disciplines concerned with abstract structures described by formal systems, such as logic, mathematics, statistics, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, information theory, game theory, systems theory, decision theory, and theoretical linguistics. Whereas the natural sciences and social sciences seek to characterize physical systems and social systems, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences use language tools concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by formal systems. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures used to describe the physical world, and what inferences may be made about them.[citation needed]
Although formal sciences are conceptual systems, lacking empirical content, this does not mean that they have no relation to the real world. But this relation is such that their formal statements hold in all possible conceivable worlds – whereas, statements based on empirical theories, such as, say, general relativity or evolutionary biology, do not hold in all possible worlds, and may eventually turn out not to hold in this world as well. That is why formal sciences are applicable in all domains and useful in all empirical sciences.[citation needed]

As a number of other disciplines of formal science rely heavily on mathematics, they did not exist until mathematics had developed to a relatively advanced level. Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal (1654), and Christiaan Huygens (1657) started the earliest study of probability theory. In the early 1800s, Gauss and Laplace developed the mathematical theory of statistics, which also explained the use of statistics in insurance and governmental accounting. Mathematical statistics was recognized as a mathematical discipline in the early 20th century.[citation needed]
Formal sciences began before the formulation of the scientific method, with the most ancient mathematical texts dating back to 1800 BC (Babylonian mathematics), 1600 BC (Egyptian mathematics) and 1000 BC (Indian mathematics). From then on, different cultures such as the Greek, Arab and Persian made major contributions to mathematics, while the Chinese and Japanese, independently of more distant cultures, developed their own mathematical tradition.[citation needed]

Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of axioms and definitions from which other statements (theorems) are deduced. For this reason, in Rudolf Carnap's logical-positivist conception of the epistemology of science, theories belonging to formal sciences are understood to contain no synthetic statements, instead containing only analytic statements.[6][7]

Logic thus obtains, in common parlance, the appellation of a formal science, not indeed in the sense as if Logic had only a form and not an object, but simply because the form of human thought is the object of Logic; so that the title formal science is properly only an abbreviated expression.[3]

Besides mathematics, logic is another example of one of oldest subjects in the field of the formal sciences. As an explicit analysis of the methods of reasoning, logic received sustained development originally in three places: India from the 6th century BC, China in the 5th century BC, and Greece between the 4th century BC and the 1st century BC.[4] The formally sophisticated treatment of modern logic descends from the Greek tradition, being informed from the transmission of Aristotelian logic, which was then further developed by Islamic logicians[citation needed]. The Indian tradition also continued into the early modern period. The native Chinese tradition did not survive beyond antiquity, though Indian logic was later adopted in medieval China.[citation needed]
As opposed to empirical sciences (natural and social), the formal sciences do not involve empirical procedures. They also do not presuppose knowledge of contingent facts, or describe the real world. In this sense, formal sciences are both logically and methodologically a priori, for their content and validity are independent of any empirical procedures.[citation needed]

The modern usage of the term formal sciences in English-language literature occurs at least as early as 1860,[non-primary source needed] in a posthumous publication of lectures on philosophy by Sir William Hamilton wherein logic and mathematics are listed as formal sciences.[1] Going even further back to 1819, a German-language textbook on logic was published by Wilhelm Esser, elucidating the significance of the designation formal science (Formalwissenschaft) as applied to logic;[2] (an English-language translation of it is provided in a William Hamilton's lecture):

One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.

Therefore, strictly speaking, formal science is not an empirical science.It is a formal logical system with its content targeted at components of experiential reality, such as information and thoughts.As Francis Bacon pointed out in the 17th century, experimental verification of the propositions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take logic itself as the way to draw conclusions in nature.Formal science is a method that is helpful to empirical science but cannot replace empirical science.[citation needed]

Still, there are complicated features of natural language that cannot be expressed in first-order logic. "Any logical system which is appropriate as an instrument for the analysis of natural language needs a much richer structure than first-order predicate logic".[31]
The set of terms is inductively defined by the following rules:[15]
In general, logical consequence in first-order logic is only semidecidable: if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then this can be discovered (for example, by searching for a proof until one is found, using some effective, sound, complete proof system). However, if A does not logically imply B, this does not mean that A logically implies the negation of B. There is no effective procedure that, given formulas A and B, always correctly decides whether A logically implies B.

Use formula substitution with φ being y=z and φ' being x=z to obtain y=x → (y=z → x=z), then use symmetry and uncurrying.
Many common rules of inference are only valid when the domain of discourse is required to be nonempty. One example is the rule stating that φ∨∃xψ{\displaystyle \varphi \lor \exists x\psi } implies ∃x(φ∨ψ){\displaystyle \exists x(\varphi \lor \psi )} when x is not a free variable in φ{\displaystyle \varphi }. This rule, which is used to put formulas into prenex normal form, is sound in nonempty domains, but unsound if the empty domain is permitted.
The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that if a first-order theory has any infinite model, then it has infinite models of every cardinality. In particular, no first-order theory with an infinite model can be categorical. Thus there is no first-order theory whose only model has the set of natural numbers as its domain, or whose only model has the set of real numbers as its domain.Many extensions of first-order logic, including infinitary logics and higher-order logics, are more expressive in the sense that they do permit categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers or real numbers[clarification needed]. This expressiveness comes at a metalogical cost, however: by Lindström's theorem, the compactness theorem and the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem cannot hold in any logic stronger than first-order.

f(x) may be interpreted as "the father of x". In arithmetic, it may stand for "-x". In set theory, it may stand for "the power set of x".
The set of formulas (also called well-formed formulas[16] or WFFs) is inductively defined by the following rules:
The domain of discourse D is a nonempty set of "objects" of some kind. Intuitively, given an interpretation, a first-order formula becomes a statement about these objects; for example, ∃xP(x){\displaystyle \exists xP(x)} states the existence of some object in D for which the predicate P is true (or, more precisely, for which the predicate assigned to the predicate symbol P by the interpretation is true). For example, one can take D to be the set of integers.
The role of the parentheses in the definition is to ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way—by following the inductive definition (i.e., there is a unique parse tree for each formula). This property is known as unique readability of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author's particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique readability.

An alternate approach to the semantics of first-order logic proceeds via abstract algebra. This approach generalizes theLindenbaum–Tarski algebras of propositional logic.There are three ways of eliminating quantified variables from first-order logic that do not involve replacing quantifiers with other variable binding term operators:

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Shapiro, Stewart; "Classical Logic". Covers syntax, model theory, and metatheory for first-order logic in the natural deduction style.
First-order logic is able to formalize many simple quantifier constructions in natural language, such as "every person who lives in Perth lives in Australia". Hence, first-order logic is used as a basis for knowledge representation languages, such as FO(.).
The related area of automated proof verification uses computer programs to check that human-created proofs are correct. Unlike complicated automated theorem provers, verification systems may be small enough that their correctness can be checked both by hand and through automated software verification. This validation of the proof verifier is needed to give confidence that any derivation labeled as "correct" is actually correct.
Existential quantifiers. A formula ∃xφ(x){\displaystyle \exists x\varphi (x)} is true according to M and μ{\displaystyle \mu } if there exists an evaluation μ′{\displaystyle \mu '} of the variables that only differs from μ{\displaystyle \mu } regarding the evaluation of x and such that φ is true according to the interpretation M and the variable assignment μ′{\displaystyle \mu '}. This formal definition captures the idea that ∃xφ(x){\displaystyle \exists x\varphi (x)} is true if and only if there is a way to choose a value for x such that φ(x) is satisfied.
In a formula, a variable may occur free or bound (or both). One formalization of this notion is due to Quine, first the concept of a variable occurrence is defined, then whether a variable occurrence is free or bound, then whether a variable symbol overall is free or bound. In order to distinguish different occurrences of the identical symbol x, each occurrence of a variable symbol x in a formula φ is identified with the initial substring of φ up to the point at which said instance of the symbol x appears.[18]p.297 Then, an occurrence of x is said to be bound if that occurrence of x lies within the scope of at least one of either ∃x{\displaystyle \exists x} or ∀x{\displaystyle \forall x}. Finally, x is bound in φ if all occurrences of x in φ are bound.[18]pp.142--143
When there are only finitely many sorts in a theory, many-sorted first-order logic can be reduced to single-sorted first-order logic.[34]: 296–299 One introduces into the single-sorted theory a unary predicate symbol for each sort in the many-sorted theory, and adds an axiom saying that these unary predicates partition the domain of discourse. For example, if there are two sorts, one adds predicate symbols P1(x){\displaystyle P_{1}(x)} and P2(x){\displaystyle P_{2}(x)} and the axiom

The course is entitled "Logic, Computation and Set Theory" and covers Ordinals and cardinals, Posets and Zorn's Lemma, Propositional logic, Predicate logic, Set theory and Consistency issues related to ZFC and other set theories.
Left-totality can be expressed by an axiom ∀x1,...,xn.∃y.F(x1,...,xn,y){\displaystyle \forall x_{1},...,x_{n}.\exists y.F(x_{1},...,x_{n},y)}; right-uniqueness by ∀x1,...,xn,y,y′.{\displaystyle \forall x_{1},...,x_{n},y,y'.} F(x1,...,xn,y)∧F(x1,...,xn,y′)→y=y′{\displaystyle F(x_{1},...,x_{n},y)\land F(x_{1},...,x_{n},y')\rightarrow y=y'}, provided the equality symbol is admitted. Both also apply to constant replacements (for n=0{\displaystyle n=0}).
The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that if a first-order theory of cardinality λ has an infinite model, then it has models of every infinite cardinality greater than or equal to λ. One of the earliest results in model theory, it implies that it is not possible to characterize countability or uncountability in a first-order language with a countable signature. That is, there is no first-order formula φ(x) such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies φ if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable (or, in the second case, uncountable).
There is a second common approach to defining truth values that does not rely on variable assignment functions. Instead, given an interpretation M, one first adds to the signature a collection of constant symbols, one for each element of the domain of discourse in M; say that for each d in the domain the constant symbol cd is fixed. The interpretation is extended so that each new constant symbol is assigned to its corresponding element of the domain. One now defines truth for quantified formulas syntactically, as follows:

A theory about a topic, such as set theory, a theory for groups,[3] or a formal theory of arithmetic, is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse (over which the quantified variables range), finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold about them. Sometimes, "theory" is understood in a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first-order logic.
A predicate symbol (or relation symbol) with some valence (or arity, number of arguments) greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by uppercase letters such as P, Q and R. Examples:In P(x), P is a predicate symbol of valence 1. One possible interpretation is "x is a man".In Q(x,y), Q is a predicate symbol of valence 2. Possible interpretations include "x is greater than y" and "x is the father of y".Relations of valence 0 can be identified with propositional variables, which can stand for any statement. One possible interpretation of R is "Socrates is a man".
For instance, first-order logic is undecidable, meaning a sound, complete and terminating decision algorithm for provability is impossible. This has led to the study of interesting decidable fragments, such as C2: first-order logic with two variables and the counting quantifiers ∃≥n{\displaystyle \exists ^{\geq n}} and ∃≤n{\displaystyle \exists ^{\leq n}}.[30]
The traditional approach can be recovered in the modern approach, by simply specifying the "custom" signature to consist of the traditional sequences of non-logical symbols.
A theory is consistent if it is not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory. A theory is complete if, for every formula in its signature, either that formula or its negation is a logical consequence of the axioms of the theory. Gödel's incompleteness theorem shows that effective first-order theories that include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers can never be both consistent and complete.

First-order logic without equality is often employed in the context of second-order arithmetic and other higher-order theories of arithmetic, where the equality relation between sets of natural numbers is usually omitted.
If a formula does not contain free variables, and so is a sentence, then the initial variable assignment does not affect its truth value. In other words, a sentence is true according to M and μ{\displaystyle \mu } if and only if it is true according to M and every other variable assignment μ′{\displaystyle \mu '}.
The interpretation of an n-ary function symbol is a function from Dn to D. For example, if the domain of discourse is the set of integers, a function symbol f of arity 2 can be interpreted as the function that gives the sum of its arguments. In other words, the symbol f is associated with the function I(f){\displaystyle I(f)} which, in this interpretation, is addition.
An alternate approach considers the equality relation to be a non-logical symbol. This convention is known as first-order logic without equality. If an equality relation is included in the signature, the axioms of equality must now be added to the theories under consideration, if desired, instead of being considered rules of logic. The main difference between this method and first-order logic with equality is that an interpretation may now interpret two distinct individuals as "equal" (although, by Leibniz's law, these will satisfy exactly the same formulas under any interpretation). That is, the equality relation may now be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation on the domain of discourse that is congruent with respect to the functions and relations of the interpretation.

First-order logic—also known as predicate logic, quantificational logic, and first-order predicate calculus—is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as "Socrates is a man", one can have expressions in the form "there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man", where "there exists" is a quantifier, while x is a variable.[1] This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations;[2] in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.

The word language is sometimes used as a synonym for signature, but this can be confusing because "language" can also refer to the set of formulas.
The definition above requires that the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be nonempty. There are settings, such as inclusive logic, where empty domains are permitted. Moreover, if a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure (for example, there is an empty poset), that class can only be an elementary class in first-order logic if empty domains are permitted or the empty structure is removed from the class.

Function symbols of valence 0 are called constant symbols, and are often denoted by lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet such as a, b and c. The symbol a may stand for Socrates. In arithmetic, it may stand for 0. In set theory, it may stand for the empty set.

Logical connectives. A formula in the form ¬φ{\displaystyle \neg \varphi }, φ→ψ{\displaystyle \varphi \rightarrow \psi }, etc. is evaluated according to the truth table for the connective in question, as in propositional logic.
Existential quantifiers (alternate). A formula ∃xφ(x){\displaystyle \exists x\varphi (x)} is true according to M if there is some d in the domain of discourse such that φ(cd){\displaystyle \varphi (c_{d})} holds. Here φ(cd){\displaystyle \varphi (c_{d})} is the result of substitutingcd for every free occurrence of x in φ.
The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that infinite structures cannot be categorically axiomatized in first-order logic. For example, there is no first-order theory whose only model is the real line: any first-order theory with an infinite model also has a model of cardinality larger than the continuum. Since the real line is infinite, any theory satisfied by the real line is also satisfied by some nonstandard models. When the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is applied to first-order set theories, the nonintuitive consequences are known as Skolem's paradox.
Many identities can be proved, which establish equivalences between particular formulas. These identities allow for rearranging formulas by moving quantifiers across other connectives, and are useful for putting formulas in prenex normal form. Some provable identities include:
It seems that symbol ⊨{\displaystyle \vDash } was introduced by Kleene, see footnote 30 in Dover's 2002 reprint of his book Mathematical Logic, John Wiley and Sons, 1967.
Bounded quantifiers are often used in the study of set theory or arithmetic.
An interpretation of a first-order language assigns a denotation to each non-logical symbol (predicate symbol, function symbol, or constant symbol) in that language. It also determines a domain of discourse that specifies the range of the quantifiers. The result is that each term is assigned an object that it represents, each predicate is assigned a property of objects, and each sentence is assigned a truth value. In this way, an interpretation provides semantic meaning to the terms, predicates, and formulas of the language. The study of the interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics. What follows is a description of the standard or Tarskian semantics for first-order logic. (It is also possible to define game semantics for first-order logic, but aside from requiring the axiom of choice, game semantics agree with Tarskian semantics for first-order logic, so game semantics will not be elaborated herein.)
The interpretation of an n-ary predicate symbol is a set of n-tuples of elements of D, giving the arguments for which the predicate is true. For example, an interpretation I(P){\displaystyle I(P)} of a binary predicate symbol P may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate P would be true if its first argument is less than its second argument. Equivalently, predicate symbols may be assigned boolean-valued functions from Dn to {true,false}{\displaystyle \{\mathrm {true,false} \}}.
The resolution rule is a single rule of inference that, together with unification, is sound and complete for first-order logic. As with the tableaux method, a formula is proved by showing that the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable. Resolution is commonly used in automated theorem proving.
Infinitary logic allows infinitely long sentences. For example, one may allow a conjunction or disjunction of infinitely many formulas, or quantification over infinitely many variables. Infinitely long sentences arise in areas of mathematics includingtopology and model theory.
In this approach, every non-logical symbol is of one of the following types:
Transitivity. If x = y and y = z then x = z.[28]

The compactness theorem has a limiting effect on which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes. For example, the compactness theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model. Thus the class of all finite graphs is not an elementary class (the same holds for many other algebraic structures).
The most commonly studied infinitary logics are denoted Lαβ, where α and β are each either cardinal numbers or the symbol ∞. In this notation, ordinary first-order logic is Lωω.In the logic L∞ω, arbitrary conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed when building formulas, and there is an unlimited supply of variables. More generally, the logic that permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than κ constituents is known as Lκω. For example, Lω1ω permits countable conjunctions and disjunctions.
The predicates "is a philosopher" and "is a scholar" each take a single variable. In general, predicates can take several variables. In the first-order sentence "Socrates is the teacher of Plato", the predicate "is the teacher of" takes two variables.
First-order logic with extra quantifiers has new quantifiers Qx,..., with meanings such as "there are many x such that ...". Also see branching quantifiers and the plural quantifiers of George Boolos and others.
Fixpoint logic extends first-order logic by adding the closure under the least fixed points of positive operators.[36]
The expressions +(x, y) and +(x, +(y, −(z))) are terms. These are usually written as x + y and x + y − z.

While propositional logic deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers predicates and quantification.
The negation of the sentence "For every a, if a is a philosopher, then a is a scholar" is logically equivalent to the sentence "There exists a such that a is a philosopher and a is not a scholar". The existential quantifier "there exists" expresses the idea that the claim "a is a philosopher and a is not a scholar" holds for some choice of a.
Unlike natural languages, such as English, the language of first-order logic is completely formal, so that it can be mechanically determined whether a given expression is well formed. There are two key types of well-formed expressions: terms, which intuitively represent objects, and formulas, which intuitively express statements that can be true or false. The terms and formulas of first-order logic are strings of symbols, where all the symbols together form the alphabet of the language. As with all formal languages, the nature of the symbols themselves is outside the scope of formal logic; they are often regarded simply as letters and punctuation symbols.
An infinite set of variables, often denoted by lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet x, y, z, ... . Subscripts are often used to distinguish variables: x0, x1, x2, ... .
^ Some authors who use the term "well-formed formula" use "formula" to mean any string of symbols from the alphabet. However, most authors in mathematical logic use "formula" to mean "well-formed formula" and have no term for non-well-formed formulas. In every context, it is only the well-formed formulas that are of interest.

Binary connectives. If φ{\displaystyle \varphi } and ψ{\displaystyle \psi } are formulas, then (φ→ψ{\displaystyle \varphi \rightarrow \psi }) is a formula. Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives.
If a theory has a binary formula A(x,y) which satisfies reflexivity and Leibniz's law, the theory is said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality. The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms, but rather as derivable theorems. For example, in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations, it is possible to define equality in terms of the relations, by defining the two terms s and t to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing s to t in any argument.
Per Lindström showed that the metalogical properties just discussed actually characterize first-order logic in the sense that no stronger logic can also have those properties (Ebbinghaus and Flum 1994, Chapter XIII). Lindström defined a class of abstract logical systems, and a rigorous definition of the relative strength of a member of this class. He established two theorems for systems of this type:
^ It seems that symbol ⊨{\displaystyle \vDash } was introduced by Kleene, see footnote 30 in Dover's 2002 reprint of his book Mathematical Logic, John Wiley and Sons, 1967.
The compactness theorem states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model.[29] This implies that if a formula is a logical consequence of an infinite set of first-order axioms, then it is a logical consequence of some finite number of those axioms. This theorem was proved first by Kurt Gödel as a consequence of the completeness theorem, but many additional proofs have been obtained over time. It is a central tool in model theory, providing a fundamental method for constructing models.

Sometimes it is useful to say that "P(x) holds for exactly one x", which can be expressed as ∃!x P(x).This notation, called uniqueness quantification, may be taken to abbreviate a formula such as ∃x (P(x)∧∀y (P(y) → (x = y))).

One motivation for the use of first-order logic, rather than higher-order logic, is that first-order logic has many metalogical properties that stronger logics do not have. These results concern general properties of first-order logic itself, rather than properties of individual theories. They provide fundamental tools for the construction of models of first-order theories.

A rule of inference states that, given a particular formula (or set of formulas) with a certain property as a hypothesis, another specific formula (or set of formulas) can be derived as a conclusion. The rule is sound (or truth-preserving) if it preserves validity in the sense that whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis, that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion.
Moreover, extra punctuation not required by the definition may be inserted—to make formulas easier to read. Thus the formula
Unlike first-order logic, for which only one semantics is studied, there are several possible semantics for second-order logic. The most commonly employed semantics for second-order and higher-order logic is known as full semantics. The combination of additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers makes higher-order logic stronger than first-order logic. In particular, the (semantic) logical consequence relation for second-order and higher-order logic is not semidecidable; there is no effective deduction system for second-order logic that is sound and complete under full semantics.
These are axiom schemas, each of which specifies an infinite set of axioms. The third schema is known as Leibniz's law, "the principle of substitutivity", "the indiscernibility of identicals", or "the replacement property". The second schema, involving the function symbol f, is (equivalent to) a special case of the third schema, using the formula

To see why the restriction on bound variables is necessary, consider the logically valid formula φ given by ∃x(x=y){\displaystyle \exists x(x=y)}, in the signature of (0,1,+,×,=) of arithmetic. If t is the term "x + 1", the formula φ[t/y] is ∃x(x=x+1){\displaystyle \exists x(x=x+1)}, which will be false in many interpretations. The problem is that the free variable x of tbecame bound during the substitution. The intended replacement can be obtained by renaming the bound variable x of φ to something else, say z, so that the formula after substitution is ∃z(z=x+1){\displaystyle \exists z(z=x+1)}, which is again logically valid.
A predicate takes an entity or entities in the domain of discourse and evaluates to true or false. Consider the two sentences "Socrates is a philosopher" and "Plato is a philosopher". In propositional logic, these sentences are viewed as being unrelated, and might be denoted, for example, by variables such as p and q. The predicate "is a philosopher" occurs in both sentences, which have a common structure of "a is a philosopher". The variable a is instantiated as "Socrates" in the first sentence, and is instantiated as "Plato" in the second sentence. While first-order logic allows for the use of predicates, such as "is a philosopher" in this example, propositional logic does not.[6]

The set of free variables in a formula of Lκω can have any cardinality strictly less than κ, yet only finitely many of them can be in the scope of any quantifier when a formula appears as a subformula of another.[35] In other infinitary logics, a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers. For example, in Lκ∞, a single universal or existential quantifier may bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously. Similarly, the logic Lκλ permits simultaneous quantification over fewer than λ variables, as well as conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than κ.
Automated theorem proving refers to the development of computer programs that search and find derivations (formal proofs) of mathematical theorems.[37] Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally infeasible for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.[citation needed]
The axioms for ordered abelian groups can be expressed as a set of sentences in the language. For example, the axiom stating that the group is commutative is usually written (∀x)(∀y)[x+y=y+x].{\displaystyle (\forall x)(\forall y)[x+y=y+x].}

If a sentence φ evaluates to true under a given interpretation M, one says that M satisfies φ; this is denoted[20] M⊨φ{\displaystyle M\vDash \varphi }. A sentence is satisfiable if there is some interpretation under which it is true. This is a bit different from the symbol ⊨{\displaystyle \vDash } from model theory, where M⊨ϕ{\displaystyle M\vDash \phi } denotes satisfiability in a model, i.e. "there is a suitable assignment of values in M{\displaystyle M}'s domain to variable symbols of ϕ{\displaystyle \phi }".[21]
Second-order logic with full semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, it is possible to create axiom systems in second-order logic that uniquely characterize the natural numbers and the real line. The cost of this expressiveness is that second-order and higher-order logics have fewer attractive metalogical properties than first-order logic. For example, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and compactness theorem of first-order logic become false when generalized to higher-order logics with full semantics.
There are systems weaker than full first-order logic for which the logical consequence relation is decidable. These include propositional logic and monadic predicate logic, which is first-order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols. Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the guarded fragment of first-order logic, as well as two-variable logic. The Bernays–Schönfinkel class of first-order formulas is also decidable. Decidable subsets of first-order logic are also studied in the framework of description logics.
The most common way of specifying an interpretation (especially in mathematics) is to specify a structure (also called a model; see below). The structure consists of a domain of discourse D and an interpretation function I mapping non-logical symbols to predicates, functions, and constants.
A formula evaluates to true or false given an interpretation and a variable assignment μ that associates an element of the domain of discourse with each variable. The reason that a variable assignment is required is to give meanings to formulas with free variables, such as y=x{\displaystyle y=x}. The truth value of this formula changes depending on whether x and y denote the same individual.
The adjective "first-order" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates or functions, or both, are permitted.[4]: 56  In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.
This definition of a formula does not support defining an if-then-else function ite(c, a, b), where "c" is a condition expressed as a formula, that would return "a" if c is true, and "b" if it is false. This is because both predicates and functions can only accept terms as parameters, but the first parameter is a formula. Some languages built on first-order logic, such as SMT-LIB 2.0, add this.[17]
Some authors only admit formulas with finitely many free variables in Lκω, and more generally only formulas with < λ free variables in Lκλ.
Logical connectives: ∧ for conjunction, ∨ for disjunction, → for implication, ↔ for biconditional, ¬ for negation. Some authors[8] use Cpq instead of → and Epq instead of ↔, especially in contexts where → is used for other purposes. Moreover, the horseshoe ⊃ may replace →; the triple-bar ≡ may replace ↔; a tilde (~), Np, or Fp may replace ¬; a double bar ‖{\displaystyle \|}, +{\displaystyle +}, ⋀pq{\displaystyle \bigwedge pq}[9], or Apq may replace ∨; and an ampersand &, Kpq, or the middle dot ⋅ may replace ∧, especially if these symbols are not available for technical reasons. (The aforementioned symbols Cpq, Epq, Np, Apq, and Kpq are used in Polish notation.)
There are many variations of first-order logic. Some of these are inessential in the sense that they merely change notation without affecting the semantics. Others change the expressive power more significantly, by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols. For example, infinitary logics permit formulas of infinite size, and modal logics add symbols for possibility and necessity.
Free and bound variables of a formula need not be disjoint sets: in the formula P(x) → ∀x Q(x), the first occurrence of x, as argument of P, is free while the second one, as argument of Q, is bound.

Functions. If f is an n-ary function symbol, and t1, ..., tn are terms, then f(t1,...,tn) is a term. In particular, symbols denoting individual constants are nullary function symbols, and thus are terms.
Non-logical symbols represent predicates (relations), functions and constants. It used to be standard practice to use a fixed, infinite set of non-logical symbols for all purposes:
Typical signatures in mathematics are {1, ×} or just {×} for groups,[3] or {0, 1, +, ×, <} for ordered fields. There are no restrictions on the number of non-logical symbols. The signature can be empty, finite, or infinite, even uncountable. Uncountable signatures occur for example in modern proofs of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem.
There are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound (i.e., all provable statements are true in all models) and complete (i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.
There are also more subtle limitations of first-order logic that are implied by the compactness theorem. For example, in computer science, many situations can be modeled as a directed graph of states (nodes) and connections (directed edges).Validating such a system may require showing that no "bad" state can be reached from any "good" state. Thus one seeks to determine if the good and bad states are in different connected components of the graph. However, the compactness theorem can be used to show that connected graphs are not an elementary class in first-order logic, and there is no formula φ(x,y) of first-order logic, in the logic of graphs, that expresses the idea that there is a path from x to y. Connectedness can be expressed in second-order logic, however, but not with only existential set quantifiers, as Σ11{\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}^{1}} also enjoys compactness.

For every integer n ≥ 0, there is a collection of n-ary, or n-place, predicate symbols. Because they represent relations between n elements, they are also called relation symbols. For each arity n, there is an infinite supply of them:Pn0, Pn1, Pn2, Pn3, ...
Some proof verifiers, such as Metamath, insist on having a complete derivation as input. Others, such as Mizar and Isabelle, take a well-formatted proof sketch (which may still be very long and detailed) and fill in the missing pieces by doing simple proof searches or applying known decision procedures: the resulting derivation is then verified by a small core "kernel". Many such systems are primarily intended for interactive use by human mathematicians: these are known as proof assistants. They may also use formal logics that are stronger than first-order logic, such as type theory. Because a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first-order deductive system will be extremely long for a human to write,[38] results are often formalized as a series of lemmas, for which derivations can be constructed separately.

^ Use formula substitution with φ being y=z and φ' being x=z to obtain y=x → (y=z → x=z), then use symmetry and uncurrying.
Restrictions such as these are useful as a technique to reduce the number of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems, which leads to shorter proofs of metalogical results. The cost of the restrictions is that it becomes more difficult to express natural-language statements in the formal system at hand, because the logical connectives used in the natural language statements must be replaced by their (longer) definitions in terms of the restricted collection of logical connectives. Similarly, derivations in the limited systems may be longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives. There is thus a trade-off between the ease of working within the formal system and the ease of proving results about the formal system.

The expressions +(x, y) = 0 and ≤(+(x, +(y, −(z))), +(x, y)) are atomic formulas. These are usually written as x + y = 0 and x + y − z  ≤  x + y.
Substitution for formulas. For any variables x and y and any formula φ(x), if φ' is obtained by replacing any number of free occurrences of x in φ with y, such that these remain free occurrences of y, thenx = y → (φ → φ').
Although first-order logic is sufficient for formalizing much of mathematics, and is commonly used in computer science and other fields, it has certain limitations. These include limitations on its expressiveness and limitations of the fragments of natural languages that it can describe.
These algebras are all lattices that properly extend the two-element Boolean algebra.

A deductive system is sound if any formula that can be derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is complete if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems discussed in this article are both sound and complete. They also share the property that it is possible to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called effective.

Quantifiers. If φ{\displaystyle \varphi }is a formula and x is a variable, then ∀xφ{\displaystyle \forall x\varphi } (for all x, φ{\displaystyle \varphi } holds) and ∃xφ{\displaystyle \exists x\varphi } (there exists x such that φ{\displaystyle \varphi }) are formulas.
In set theory with one relation ∈, one may define s = t to be an abbreviation for ∀x (s ∈ x ↔ t ∈ x) ∧ ∀x (x ∈ s ↔ x ∈t). This definition of equality then automatically satisfies the axioms for equality. In this case, one should replace the usual axiom of extensionality, which can be stated as ∀x∀y[∀z(z∈x⇔z∈y)⇒x=y]{\displaystyle \forall x\forall y[\forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow x=y]}, with an alternative formulation ∀x∀y[∀z(z∈x⇔z∈y)⇒∀z(x∈z⇔y∈z)]{\displaystyle \forall x\forall y[\forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow \forall z(x\in z\Leftrightarrow y\in z)]}, which says that ifsets x and y have the same elements, then they also belong to the same sets.
A logical system satisfying Lindström's definition that has a semidecidable logical consequence relation and satisfies the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.

Natural deduction systems resemble Hilbert-style systems in that a deduction is a finite list of formulas. However, natural deduction systems have no logical axioms; they compensate by adding additional rules of inference that can be used to manipulate the logical connectives in formulas in the proof.

Many theories have an intended interpretation, a certain model that is kept in mind when studying the theory. For example, the intended interpretation of Peano arithmetic consists of the usual natural numbers with their usual operations. However, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that most first-order theories will also have other, nonstandard models.
Automated theorem provers are also used to implement formal verification in computer science. In this setting, theorem provers are used to verify the correctness of programs and of hardware such as processors with respect to a formal specification. Because such analysis is time-consuming and thus expensive, it is usually reserved for projects in which a malfunction would have grave human or financial consequences.
Negation. If φ{\displaystyle \varphi } is a formula, then ¬φ{\displaystyle \lnot \varphi } is a formula.
First, the variable assignment μ can be extended to all terms of the language, with the result that each term maps to a single element of the domain of discourse. The following rules are used to make this assignment:
The sequent calculus was developed to study the properties of natural deduction systems.[25] Instead of working with one formula at a time, it usessequents, which are expressions of the form
The resolution method works only with formulas that are disjunctions of atomic formulas; arbitrary formulas must first be converted to this form through Skolemization. The resolution rule states that from the hypotheses A1∨⋯∨Ak∨C{\displaystyle A_{1}\lor \cdots \lor A_{k}\lor C} and B1∨⋯∨Bl∨¬C{\displaystyle B_{1}\lor \cdots \lor B_{l}\lor \lnot C}, the conclusion A1∨⋯∨Ak∨B1∨⋯∨Bl{\displaystyle A_{1}\lor \cdots \lor A_{k}\lor B_{1}\lor \cdots \lor B_{l}} can be obtained.
Intuitionistic first-order logic uses intuitionistic rather than classical propositional calculus; for example, ¬¬φ need not be equivalent to φ.
Functions. Given terms t1,…,tn{\displaystyle t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n}} that have been evaluated to elements d1,…,dn{\displaystyle d_{1},\ldots ,d_{n}} of the domain of discourse, and a n-ary function symbol f, the term f(t1,…,tn){\displaystyle f(t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n})} evaluates to (I(f))(d1,…,dn){\displaystyle (I(f))(d_{1},\ldots ,d_{n})}.
Relationships between predicates can be stated using logical connectives. Consider, for example, the first-order formula "if a is a philosopher, then a is a scholar". This formula is a conditional statement with "a is a philosopher" as its hypothesis, and "a is a scholar" as its conclusion. The truth of this formula depends on which object is denoted by a, and on the interpretations of the predicates "is a philosopher" and "is a scholar".

Though signatures might in some cases imply how non-logical symbols are to be interpreted, interpretation of the non-logical symbols in the signature is separate (and not necessarily fixed). Signatures concern syntax rather than semantics.
The formation rules define the terms and formulas of first-order logic.[14] When terms and formulas are represented as strings of symbols, these rules can be used to write a formal grammar for terms and formulas. These rules are generally context-free (each production has a single symbol on the left side), except that the set of symbols may be allowed to be infinite and there may be many start symbols, for example the variables in the case of terms.
Equality. If the equality symbol is considered part of logic, and t1 and t2 are terms, then t1 = t2 is a formula.
Universal quantifiers (alternate). A formula ∀xφ(x){\displaystyle \forall x\varphi (x)} is true according to M if, for every d in the domain of discourse, φ(cd){\displaystyle \varphi (c_{d})} is true according to M.
^ More precisely, there is only one language of each variant of one-sorted first-order logic: with or without equality, with or without functions, with or without propositional variables, ....
It is possible to entirely avoid function symbols and constant symbols, rewriting them via predicate symbols in an appropriate way. For example, instead of using a constant symbol 0{\displaystyle \;0}one may use a predicate0(x){\displaystyle \;0(x)}(interpreted as x=0{\displaystyle \;x=0} ), and replace every predicate such as P(0,y){\displaystyle \;P(0,y)} with ∀x(0(x)→P(x,y)){\displaystyle \forall x\;(0(x)\rightarrow P(x,y))}. A function such as f(x1,x2,...,xn){\displaystyle f(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})} will similarly be replaced by a predicateF(x1,x2,...,xn,y){\displaystyle F(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n},y)} interpreted as y=f(x1,x2,...,xn){\displaystyle y=f(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})}. This change requires adding additional axioms to the theory at hand, so that interpretations of the predicate symbols used have the correct semantics.[32]
For example, in ∀x ∀y (P(x) → Q(x,f(x),z)), x and y occur only bound,[19]z occurs only free, and w is neither because it does not occur in the formula.
Quantifier symbols: ∀ for universal quantification, and ∃ for existential quantification

Thus, when the empty domain is permitted, it must often be treated as a special case. Most authors, however, simply exclude the empty domain by definition.
A more recent practice is to use different non-logical symbols according to the application one has in mind. Therefore, it has become necessary to name the set of all non-logical symbols used in a particular application. This choice is made via a signature.[11]
Ordinary first-order interpretations have a single domain of discourse over which all quantifiers range. Many-sorted first-order logic allows variables to have different sorts, which have different domains. This is also called typed first-order logic, and the sorts called types (as in data type), but it is not the same as first-order type theory. Many-sorted first-order logic is often used in the study of second-order arithmetic.[33]

Quantifiers can be applied to variables in a formula. The variable a in the previous formula can be universally quantified, for instance, with the first-order sentence "For every a, if a is a philosopher, then a is a scholar". The universal quantifier "for every" in this sentence expresses the idea that the claim "if a is a philosopher, then a is a scholar" holds for all choices of a.
A formula is logically valid (or simply valid) if it is true in every interpretation.[22] These formulas play a role similar to tautologies in propositional logic.
Gödel's completeness theorem, proved by Kurt Gödel in 1929, establishes that there are sound, complete, effective deductive systems for first-order logic, and thus the first-order logical consequence relation is captured by finite provability. Naively, the statement that a formula φ logically implies a formula ψ depends on every model of φ; these models will in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality, and so logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model. However, it is possible to enumerate all finite derivations and search for a derivation of ψ from φ. If ψ is logically implied by φ, such a derivation will eventually be found. Thus first-order logical consequence is semidecidable: it is possible to make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences (φ,ψ) such that ψ is a logical consequence of φ.

Relations of valence 0 can be identified with propositional variables, which can stand for any statement. One possible interpretation of R is "Socrates is a man".

A deductive system is used to demonstrate, on a purely syntactic basis, that one formula is a logical consequence of another formula. There are many such systems for first-order logic, including Hilbert-style deductive systems, natural deduction, the sequent calculus, the tableaux method, and resolution. These share the common property that a deduction is a finite syntactic object; the format of this object, and the way it is constructed, vary widely.These finite deductions themselves are often called derivations in proof theory. They are also often called proofs, but are completely formalized unlike natural-language mathematical proofs.
First-order fuzzy logics are first-order extensions of propositional fuzzy logics rather than classical propositional calculus.
The interpretation of a constant symbol (a function symbol of arity 0) is a function from D0 (a set whose only member is the empty tuple) to D, which can be simply identified with an object in D. For example, an interpretation may assign the value I(c)=10{\displaystyle I(c)=10} to the constant symbol c{\displaystyle c}.
The characteristic feature of first-order logic is that individuals can be quantified, but not predicates. Thus

Intuitively, a variable symbol is free in a formula if at no point is it quantified:[18]pp.142--143 in ∀y P(x, y), the sole occurrence of variable x is free while that of y is bound. The free and bound variable occurrences in a formula are defined inductively as follows.
In this traditional approach, there is only one language of first-order logic.[10] This approach is still common, especially in philosophically oriented books.
A first-order structure that satisfies all sentences in a given theory is said to be a model of the theory. An elementary class is the set of all structures satisfying a particular theory. These classes are a main subject of study in model theory.
There are several different conventions for using equality (or identity) in first-order logic. The most common convention, known as first-order logic with equality, includes the equality symbol as a primitive logical symbol which is always interpreted as the real equality relation between members of the domain of discourse, such that the "two" given members are the same member. This approach also adds certain axioms about equality to the deductive system employed. These equality axioms are:[26]: 198–200

When the arity of a predicate symbol or function symbol is clear from context, the superscript n is often omitted.
First-order logic can be studied in languages with fewer logical symbols than were described above.

is not, in most formalizations of first-order logic. Second-order logic extends first-order logic by adding the latter type of quantification. Other higher-order logics allow quantification over even higher types than second-order logic permits. These higher types include relations between relations, functions from relations to relations between relations, and other higher-type objects.Thus the "first" in first-order logic describes the type of objects that can be quantified.

^ Use formula substitution with φ being x=x and φ' being y=x, then use reflexivity.
The substitution rule demonstrates several common aspects of rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; one can tell whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, as is often the case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.
Tarski and Givant (1987) showed that the fragment of first-order logic that has no atomic sentence lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers has the same expressive power as relation algebra.[23]: 32–33  This fragment is of great interest because it suffices for Peano arithmetic and most axiomatic set theory, including the canonical ZFC. They also prove that first-order logic with a primitive ordered pair is equivalent to a relation algebra with two ordered pair projection functions.[24]: 803
For convenience, conventions have been developed about the precedence of the logical operators, to avoid the need to write parentheses in some cases. These rules are similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. A common convention is:
6Metalogical properties											Toggle Metalogical properties subsection																					6.1Completeness and undecidability																											6.2The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem																											6.3The compactness theorem																											6.4Lindström's theorem
When this second convention is followed, the term normal model is used to refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals a and b satisfy a = b. In first-order logic with equality, only normal models are considered, and so there is no term for a model other than a normal model. When first-order logic without equality is studied, it is necessary to amend the statements of results such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem so that only normal models are considered.
In arithmetic, g(x,y) may stand for "x+y". In set theory, it may stand for "the union of x and y".
(∀x∀y[≤⁡(+⁡(x,y),z)→∀x∀y+⁡(x,y)=0)]{\displaystyle (\forall x\forall y\,[\mathop {\leq } (\mathop {+} (x,y),z)\to \forall x\,\forall y\,\mathop {+} (x,y)=0)]}
Then the elements satisfying P1{\displaystyle P_{1}} are thought of as elements of the first sort, and elements satisfying P2{\displaystyle P_{2}} as elements of the second sort. One can quantify over each sort by using the corresponding predicate symbol to limit the range of quantification. For example, to say there is an element of the first sort satisfying formula φ(x), one writes
First-order modal logic allows one to describe other possible worlds as well as this contingently true world which we inhabit. In some versions, the set of possible worlds varies depending on which possible world one inhabits. Modal logic has extra modal operators with meanings which can be characterized informally as, for example"it is necessary that φ" (true in all possible worlds) and "it is possible that φ" (true in some possible world). With standard first-order logic we have a single domain and each predicate is assigned one extension. With first-order modal logic we have a domain function that assigns each possible world its own domain, so that each predicate gets an extension only relative to these possible worlds. This allows us to model cases where, for example, Alex is a philosopher, but might have been a mathematician, and might not have existed at all. In the first possible world P(a) is true, in the second P(a) is false, and in the third possible world there is no a in the domain at all.

Predicate symbols. If P is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, ..., tn are terms then P(t1,...,tn) is a formula.
Not all of these symbols are required in first-order logic. Either one of the quantifiers along with negation, conjunction (or disjunction), variables, brackets, and equality suffices.

Infinitary logic generalizes first-order logic to allow formulas of infinite length. The most common way in which formulas can become infinite is through infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. However, it is also possible to admit generalized signatures in which function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities, or in which quantifiers can bind infinitely many variables. Because an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string, it is necessary to choose some other representation of formulas; the usual representation in this context is a tree. Thus formulas are, essentially, identified with their parse trees, rather than with the strings being parsed.

A logical system satisfying Lindström's definition that contains first-order logic and satisfies both the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.

Similarly, it is sufficient to have only ¬{\displaystyle \neg } and →{\displaystyle \rightarrow } as logical connectives, or to have only the Sheffer stroke (NAND) or the Peirce arrow (NOR) operator.
Additional logical connectives such as the Sheffer stroke, Dpq (NAND), and exclusive or, Jpq.
Unlike the methods just described, the derivations in the tableaux method are not lists of formulas. Instead, a derivation is a tree of formulas. To show that a formula A is provable, the tableaux method attempts to demonstrate that the negation of A is unsatisfiable. The tree of the derivation has ¬A{\displaystyle \lnot A} at its root; the tree branches in a way that reflects the structure of the formula. For example, to show that C∨D{\displaystyle C\lor D} is unsatisfiable requires showing that C and D are each unsatisfiable; this corresponds to a branching point in the tree with parent C∨D{\displaystyle C\lor D} and children C and D.
Some authors who use the term "well-formed formula" use "formula" to mean any string of symbols from the alphabet. However, most authors in mathematical logic use "formula" to mean "well-formed formula" and have no term for non-well-formed formulas. In every context, it is only the well-formed formulas that are of interest.

A formula in first-order logic with no free variable occurrences is called a first-order sentence. These are the formulas that will have well-defined truth values under an interpretation. For example, whether a formula such as Phil(x) is true must depend on what x represents. But the sentence ∃x Phil(x) will be either true or false in a given interpretation.
Avigad, et al. (2007) discuss the process of formally verifying a proof of the prime number theorem. The formalized proof required approximately 30,000 lines of input to the Isabelle proof verifier.

An interpretation (or model) of a first-order formula specifies what each predicate means, and the entities that can instantiate the variables. These entities form the domain of discourse or universe, which is usually required to be a nonempty set. For example, in an interpretation with the domain of discourse consisting of all human beings and the predicate "is a philosopher" understood as "was the author of the Republic", the sentence "There exists a such that a is a philosopher" is seen as being true, as witnessed by Plato.[clarification needed]
It is common to divide the symbols of the alphabet into logical symbols, which always have the same meaning, and non-logical symbols, whose meaning varies by interpretation.[citation needed] For example, the logical symbol ∧{\displaystyle \land } always represents "and"; it is never interpreted as "or", which is represented by the logical symbol ∨{\displaystyle \lor }. However, a non-logical predicate symbol such as Phil(x) could be interpreted to mean "x is a philosopher", "x is a man named Philip", or any other unary predicate depending on the interpretation at hand.
Universal quantifiers. A formula ∀xφ(x){\displaystyle \forall x\varphi (x)} is true according to M and μ{\displaystyle \mu } if φ(x) is true for every pair composed by the interpretation M and some variable assignment μ′{\displaystyle \mu '} that differs from μ{\displaystyle \mu } only on the value of x. This captures the idea that ∀xφ(x){\displaystyle \forall x\varphi (x)} is true if every possible choice of a value for x causes φ(x) to be true.
^ Rogers, R. L., Mathematical Logic and Formalized Theories: A Survey of Basic Concepts and Results (Amsterdam/London: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1971), p. 39.
Because ∃xφ(x){\displaystyle \exists x\varphi (x)} can be expressed as ¬∀x¬φ(x){\displaystyle \neg \forall x\neg \varphi (x)}, and ∀xφ(x){\displaystyle \forall x\varphi (x)} can be expressed as ¬∃x¬φ(x){\displaystyle \neg \exists x\neg \varphi (x)}, either of the two quantifiers ∃{\displaystyle \exists } and ∀{\displaystyle \forall } can be dropped.
A deduction in a Hilbert-style deductive system is a list of formulas, each of which is a logical axiom, a hypothesis that has been assumed for the derivation at hand, or follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference. The logical axioms consist of several axiom schemas of logically valid formulas; these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic. The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers. Typical Hilbert-style systems have a small number of rules of inference, along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms. It is common to have only modus ponens and universal generalization as rules of inference.
First-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms, and is studied in the foundations of mathematics.Peano arithmetic and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic.No first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, categorical axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.
For example, one common rule of inference is the rule of substitution. If t is a term and φ is a formula possibly containing the variable x, then φ[t/x] is the result of replacing all free instances of x by t in φ. The substitution rule states that for any φ and any term t, one can conclude φ[t/x] from φ provided that no free variable of t becomes bound during the substitution process. (If some free variable of t becomes bound, then to substitute t for x it is first necessary to change the bound variables of φ to differ from the free variables of t.)
is a formula, if f is a unary function symbol, P a unary predicate symbol, and Q a ternary predicate symbol. However, ∀xx→{\displaystyle \forall x\,x\rightarrow } is not a formula, although it is a string of symbols from the alphabet.
A first-order theory of a particular signature is a set of axioms, which are sentences consisting of symbols from that signature. The set of axioms is often finite or recursively enumerable, in which case the theory is called effective. Some authors require theories to also include all logical consequences of the axioms. The axioms are considered to hold within the theory and from them other sentences that hold within the theory can be derived.
The expression (∀x∀y[≤⁡(+⁡(x,y),z)→∀x∀y+⁡(x,y)=0)]{\displaystyle (\forall x\forall y\,[\mathop {\leq } (\mathop {+} (x,y),z)\to \forall x\,\forall y\,\mathop {+} (x,y)=0)]} is a formula, which is usually written as ∀x∀y(x+y≤z)→∀x∀y(x+y=0).{\displaystyle \forall x\forall y(x+y\leq z)\to \forall x\forall y(x+y=0).} This formula has one free variable, z.

Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1 and 2 are terms. For example, no expression involving a predicate symbol is a term.
A key property of deductive systems is that they are purely syntactic, so that derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation. Thus a sound argument is correct in every possible interpretation of the language, regardless of whether that interpretation is about mathematics, economics, or some other area.
It is also possible to restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols, in sufficiently expressive theories. One can in principle dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than 2 and predicates of arity greater than 1 in theories that include a pairing function. This is a function of arity 2 that takes pairs of elements of the domain and returns an ordered pair containing them. It is also sufficient to have two predicate symbols of arity 2 that define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components. In either case it is necessary that the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections are satisfied.
Unlike propositional logic, first-order logic is undecidable (although semidecidable), provided that the language has at least one predicate of arity at least 2 (other than equality). This means that there is no decision procedure that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid. This result was established independently by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in 1936 and 1937, respectively, giving a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem posed by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928. Their proofs demonstrate a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first-order logic and the unsolvability of the halting problem.

A function symbol, with some valence greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by lowercase roman letters such as f, g and h. Examples:f(x) may be interpreted as "the father of x". In arithmetic, it may stand for "-x". In set theory, it may stand for "the power set of x".In arithmetic, g(x,y) may stand for "x+y". In set theory, it may stand for "the union of x and y".Function symbols of valence 0 are called constant symbols, and are often denoted by lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet such as a, b and c. The symbol a may stand for Socrates. In arithmetic, it may stand for 0. In set theory, it may stand for the empty set.
Satisfiability of formulas with free variables is more complicated, because an interpretation on its own does not determine the truth value of such a formula. The most common convention is that a formula φ with free variables x1{\displaystyle x_{1}}, ..., xn{\displaystyle x_{n}} is said to be satisfied by an interpretation if the formula φ remains true regardless which individuals from the domain of discourse are assigned to its free variables x1{\displaystyle x_{1}}, ..., xn{\displaystyle x_{n}}. This has the same effect as saying that a formula φ is satisfied if and only if its universal closure ∀x1…∀xnϕ(x1,…,xn){\displaystyle \forall x_{1}\dots \forall x_{n}\phi (x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} is satisfied.
In some fields, it is common to use infix notation for binary relations and functions, instead of the prefix notation defined above. For example, in arithmetic, one typically writes "2 + 2 = 4" instead of "=(+(2,2),4)". It is common to regard formulas in infix notation as abbreviations for the corresponding formulas in prefix notation, cf. also term structure vs. representation.
Next, each formula is assigned a truth value. The inductive definition used to make this assignment is called the T-schema.
In P(x), P is a predicate symbol of valence 1. One possible interpretation is "x is a man".

Since atomic formulas can be viewed as trees, too, and renaming is essentially a concept on trees, atomic (and, more generally, quantifier-free) formulas can be renamed in a similar way as terms. In fact, some authors consider a quantifier-free formula as a term (of type bool rather than e.g. int, cf. #Sorted terms below).

Given a set V of variable symbols, a set C of constant symbols and sets Fn of n-ary function symbols, also called operator symbols, for each natural number n ≥ 1, the set of (unsorted first-order) terms T is recursively defined to be the smallest set with the following properties:[1]
At each position p of a term t, a unique subterm starts, which is commonly denoted by t|p. For example, at position 122 of the black term in the picture, the subterm a+2 has its root. The relation "is a subterm of" is a partial order on the set of terms; it is reflexive since each term is trivially a subterm of itself.
Besides in logic, terms play important roles in universal algebra, and rewriting systems.

For example, a vector space comes with an associated field of scalar numbers. Let W and N denote the sort of vectors and numbers, respectively, let VW and VN be the set of vector and number variables, respectively, and CW and CN the set of vector and number constants, respectively. Then e.g. 0→∈CW{\displaystyle {\vec {0}}\in C_{W}} and 0 ∈ CN, and the vector addition, the scalar multiplication, and the inner product is declared as +:W×W→W,∗:W×N→W{\displaystyle +:W\times W\to W,*:W\times N\to W}, and ⟨.,.⟩:W×W→N{\displaystyle \langle .,.\rangle :W\times W\to N}, respectively. Assuming variable symbols v→,w→∈VW{\displaystyle {\vec {v}},{\vec {w}}\in V_{W}} and a,b ∈ VN, the term ⟨(v→+0→)∗a,w→∗b⟩{\displaystyle \langle ({\vec {v}}+{\vec {0}})*a,{\vec {w}}*b\rangle } is well-sorted, while v→+a{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}+a} is not (since + doesn't accept a term of sort N as 2nd argument). In order to make a∗v→{\displaystyle a*{\vec {v}}} a well-sorted term, an additional declaration ∗:N×W→W{\displaystyle *:N\times W\to W} is required. Function symbols having several declarations are called overloaded.
from every n terms t1,...,tn, and every n-ary function symbol f ∈ Fn, a larger term f(t1, ..., tn) can be built.
θh+1=∑i=0∞fi⋅θhi{\displaystyle \theta _{h+1}=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }f_{i}\cdot \theta _{h}^{i}}, since a ground term of height up to h+1 can be obtained by composing any i ground terms of height up to h, using an i-ary root function symbol. The sum has a finite value if there is only a finite number of constants and function symbols, which is usually the case.
A term denotes a mathematical object from the domain of discourse. A constant c denotes a named object from that domain, a variable x ranges over the objects in that domain, and an n-ary function f maps n-tuples of objects to objects. For example, if n ∈ V is a variable symbol, 1 ∈ C is a constant symbol, and add ∈ F2 is a binary function symbol, then n ∈ T, 1 ∈ T, and (hence) add(n, 1) ∈ T by the first, second, and third term building rule, respectively. The latter term is usually written as n+1, using infix notation and the more common operator symbol + for convenience.
θ0 = f0, since a ground term of height 0 can only be a constant,
Given a set Rn of n-ary relation symbols for each natural number n ≥ 1, an (unsorted first-order) atomic formula is obtained by applying an n-ary relation symbol to n terms. As for function symbols, a relation symbol set Rn is usually non-empty only for small n. In mathematical logic, more complex formulas are built from atomic formulas using logical connectives and quantifiers. For example, letting R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } denote the set of real numbers, ∀x: x ∈ R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } ⇒ (x+1)⋅(x+1) ≥ 0 is a mathematical formula evaluating to true in the algebra of complex numbers.An atomic formula is called ground if it is built entirely from ground terms; all ground atomic formulas composable from a given set of function and predicate symbols make up the Herbrand base for these symbol sets.
{ x ↦ a, y ↦ a+1, z ↦ a+2 }
In mathematical logic, a term denotes a mathematical object while a formula denotes a mathematical fact. In particular, terms appear as components of a formula. This is analogous to natural language, where a noun phrase refers to an object and a whole sentence refers to a fact.
The rightmost column of the table indicates how each mathematical notation example can be represented by a lambda term, also converting common infix operators into prefix form.
Renaming of the commutativity axiom can be viewed as alpha-conversion on the universal closure of the axiom: "x+y=y+x" actually means "∀x,y: x+y=y+x", which is synonymous to "∀a,b: a+b=b+a"; see also #Lambda terms below.
Using an intuitive, pseudo-grammatical notation, this is sometimes written as:
Two terms are said to be structurally, literally, or syntactically equal if they correspond to the same tree. For example, the left and the right tree in the above picture are structurally unequal terms, although they might be considered "semantically equal" as they always evaluate to the same value in rational arithmetic. While structural equality can be checked without any knowledge about the meaning of the symbols, semantic equality cannot. If the function / is e.g. interpreted not as rational but astruncating integer division, then at n=2 the left and right term evaluates to 3 and 2, respectively.Structural equal terms need to agree in their variable names.
Abbreviating the number of constants as f0, and the number of i-ary function symbols as fi, the number θh of distinct ground termsof a height up to h can be computed by the following recursion formula:
The size of a term commonly refers to the number of its nodes, or, equivalently, to the length of the term's written representation, counting symbols without parentheses. The black and the blue term in the picture has the size 15 and 5, respectively.
Given a signature for the function symbols, the set of alltermsforms the free term algebra. The set of all ground terms forms the initial term algebra.

To each node of a term, its depth (called height by some authors) can be assigned, i.e. its distance (number of edges) from the root. In this setting, the depth of a node always equals the length of its position string. In the picture, depth levels in the black term are indicated in green.
When the domain of discourse contains elements of basically different kinds, it is useful to split the set of all terms accordingly. To this end, a sort (sometimes also called type) is assigned to each variable and each constant symbol, and a declaration [note 3] of domain sorts and range sort to each function symbol. A sorted term f(t1,...,tn) may be composed from sorted subterms t1,...,tn only if the ith subterm's sort matches the declared ith domain sort of f. Such a term is also called well-sorted; any other term (i.e. obeying the unsorted rules only) is called ill-sorted.

Lambda terms can be used to denote anonymous functions to be supplied as arguments to lim, Σ, ∫, etc.
^ Renaming of the commutativity axiom can be viewed as alpha-conversion on the universal closure of the axiom: "x+y=y+x" actually means "∀x,y: x+y=y+x", which is synonymous to "∀a,b: a+b=b+a"; see also #Lambda terms below.
The set of variables of a term t is denoted by vars(t).A term that doesn't contain any variables is called a ground term; a term that doesn't contain multiple occurrences of a variable is called a linear term.For example, 2+2 is a ground term and hence also a linear term, x⋅(n+1) is a linear term, n⋅(n+1) is a non-linear term. These properties are important in, for example, term rewriting.
For example, the function square from the C program below can be written anonymously as a lambda term λi. i2. The general sum operator Σ can then be considered as a ternary function symbol taking a lower bound value, an upper bound value and a function to be summed-up. Due to its latter argument, the Σ operator is called a second-order function symbol.As another example, the lambda term λn. x/n denotes a function that maps 1, 2, 3, ... to x/1, x/2, x/3, ..., respectively, that is, it denotes the sequence (x/1, x/2, x/3, ...). The lim operator takes such a sequence and returns its limit (if defined).
// implements anonymous function (lambda i. i*i); however, C requires a name for it
Hermes, Hans (1973). Introduction to Mathematical Logic. Springer London. ISBN 3540058192. ISSN 1431-4657.; here: Sect.II.1.3
All these operators can be viewed as taking a function rather than a value term as one of their arguments. For example, the lim operator is applied to a sequence, i.e. to a mapping from positive integer to e.g. real numbers. As another example, a C function to implement the second example from the table, Σ, would have a function pointer argument (see box below).
The term obtained by replacing in a term t the subterm at a position p by a new term u is commonly denoted by t[u]p. The term t[u]p can also be viewed as resulting from a generalized concatenation of the term u with a term-like object t[.]; the latter is called a context, or a term with a hole (indicated by "."; its position being p), in which u is said to be embedded. For example, if t is the black term in the picture, then t[b+1]12 results in the term a∗(b+1)1∗(2∗3){\displaystyle {\frac {a*(b+1)}{1*(2*3)}}}.The latter term also results from embedding the term b+1 into the context a∗(.)1∗(2∗3){\displaystyle {\frac {a*(\;.\;)}{1*(2*3)}}}. In an informal sense, the operations of instantiating and embedding are converse to each other: while the former appends function symbols at the bottom of the term, the latter appends them at the top. The encompassment ordering relates a term and any result of appends on both sides.

Since a term has the structure of a tree hierarchy, to each of its nodes a position, or path, can be assigned, that is, a string of natural numbers indicating the node's place in the hierarchy. The empty string, commonly denoted by ε, is assigned to the root node. Position strings within the black term are indicated in red in the picture.
See many-sorted logic for more information, including extensions of the many-sorted framework described here.
A first-order term is recursively constructed from constant symbols, variables and function symbols.An expression formed by applying a predicate symbol to an appropriate number of terms is called an atomic formula, which evaluates to true or false in bivalent logics, given an interpretation.For example, (x+1)∗(x+1){\displaystyle (x+1)*(x+1)} is a term built from the constant 1, the variable x, and the binary function symbols +{\displaystyle +} and ∗{\displaystyle *}; it is part of the atomic formula (x+1)∗(x+1)≥0{\displaystyle (x+1)*(x+1)\geq 0} which evaluates to true for each real-numbered value of x.
Originally, logicians defined a term to be a character string adhering to certain building rules.[2] However, since the concept of tree became popular in computer science, it turned out to be more convenient to think of a term as a tree. For example, several distinct character strings, like "(n⋅(n+1))/2","((n⋅(n+1)))/2", and "n(n+1)2{\displaystyle {\frac {n(n+1)}{2}}}", denote the same term and correspond to the same tree, viz. the left tree in the above picture.Separating the tree structure of a term from its graphical representation on paper, it is also easy to account for parentheses (being only representation, not structure) and invisible multiplication operators (existing only in structure, not in representation).

The signature of the term language describes which function symbol sets Fn are inhabited. Well-known examples are the unary function symbols sin, cos ∈ F1, and the binary function symbols +, −, ⋅, / ∈ F2. Ternary operations and higher-arity functions are possible but uncommon in practice. Many authors consider constant symbols as 0-ary function symbols F0, thus needing no special syntactic class for them.
A term u matches a term t, if a substitution instance of u structurally equals a subterm of t, or formally, if uσ = t|p for some position p in t and some substitution σ. In this case, u, t, and σ are called the pattern term, the subject term, and the matching substitution, respectively. In the picture, the blue pattern term x∗(y∗z){\displaystyle x*(y*z)} matches the black subject term at position 1, with the matching substitution{ x ↦ a, y ↦ a+1, z ↦ a+2 }indicated by blue variables immediately left to their black substitutes. Intuitively, the pattern, except for its variables, must be contained in the subject; if a variable occurs multiple times in the pattern, equal subterms are required at the respective positions of the subject.
Mathematical notations as shown in the table do not fit into the scheme of a first-order term as defined above, as they all introduce an own local, or bound, variable that may not appear outside the notation's scope, e.g. t⋅∫absin⁡(k⋅t)dt{\displaystyle t\cdot \int _{a}^{b}\sin(k\cdot t)\;dt} doesn't make sense. In contrast, the other variables, referred to as free, behave like ordinary first-order term variables, e.g. k⋅∫absin⁡(k⋅t)dt{\displaystyle k\cdot \int _{a}^{b}\sin(k\cdot t)\;dt} does make sense.

In contrast, a term t is called a renaming, or a variant, of a term u if the latter resulted from consistently renaming all variables of the former, i.e. if u = tσ for some renaming substitution σ. In that case, u is a renaming of t, too, since a renaming substitution σ has an inverse σ−1, and t = uσ−1. Both terms are then also said to be equal modulo renaming. In many contexts, the particular variable names in a term don't matter, e.g. the commutativity axiom for addition can be stated as x+y=y+x or as a+b=b+a; in such cases the whole formula may be renamed, while an arbitrary subterm usually may not, e.g. x+y=b+a is not a valid version of the commutativity axiom.[note 1][note 2]
In Quine's set-theoretical writing, the phrase "ultimate class" is often used instead of the phrase "proper class" emphasising that in the systems he considers, certain classes cannot be members, and are thus the final term in any membership chain to which they belong.
A class that is not a set (informally in Zermelo–Fraenkel) is called a proper class, and a class that is a set is sometimes called a small class. For instance, the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all sets, are proper classes in many formal systems.
Jech, Thomas (2003), Set Theory, Springer Monographs in Mathematics (third millennium ed.), Berlin, New York: Springer-Verlag, ISBN 978-3-540-44085-7
Another approach is taken by the von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms (NBG); classes are the basic objects in this theory, and a set is then defined to be a class that is an element of some other class. However, the class existence axioms of NBG are restricted so that they only quantify over sets, rather than over all classes. This causes NBG to be a conservative extension of ZF.
The paradoxes of naive set theory can be explained in terms of the inconsistent tacit assumption that "all classes are sets". With a rigorous foundation, these paradoxes instead suggest proofs that certain classes are proper (i.e., that they are not sets). For example, Russell's paradox suggests a proof that the class of all sets which do not contain themselves is proper, and the Burali-Forti paradox suggests that the class of all ordinal numbers is proper. The paradoxes do not arise with classes because there is no notion of classes containing classes. Otherwise, one could, for example, define a class of all classes that do not contain themselves, which would lead to a Russell paradox for classes.A conglomerate, on the other hand, can have proper classes as members, although the theory of conglomerates is not yet well-established.[citation needed]

Within set theory, many collections of sets turn out to be proper classes. Examples include the class of all sets, the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all cardinal numbers.

Outside set theory, the word "class" is sometimes used synonymously with "set". This usage dates from a historical period where classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology.[1] Many discussions of "classes" in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or rather perhaps take place without considering that certain classes can fail to be sets.
In ZF, the concept of a function can also be generalised to classes. A class function is not a function in the usual sense, since it is not a set; it is rather a formula Φ(x,y){\displaystyle \Phi (x,y)} with the property that for any set x{\displaystyle x} there is no more than one set y{\displaystyle y} such that the pair (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} satisfies Φ.{\displaystyle \Phi .} For example, the class function mapping each set to its successor may be expressed as the formula y=x∪{x}.{\displaystyle y=x\cup \{x\}.} The fact that the ordered pair (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} satisfies Φ{\displaystyle \Phi } may be expressed with the shorthand notation Φ(x)=y.{\displaystyle \Phi (x)=y.}
In other set theories, such as New Foundations or the theory of semisets, the concept of "proper class" still makes sense (not all classes are sets) but the criterion of sethood is not closed under subsets. For example, any set theory with a universal set has proper classes which are subclasses of sets.
Because classes do not have any formal status in the theory of ZF, the axioms of ZF do not immediately apply to classes. However, if an inaccessible cardinal κ{\displaystyle \kappa } is assumed, then the sets of smaller rank form a model of ZF (a Grothendieck universe), and its subsets can be thought of as "classes".

In set theory and its applications throughout mathematics, a class is a collection of sets (or sometimes other mathematical objects) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share. Classes act as a way to have set-like collections while differing from sets so as to avoid Russell's paradox (see § Paradoxes). The precise definition of "class" depends on foundational context. In work on Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the notion of class is informal, whereas other set theories, such as von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, axiomatize the notion of "proper class", e.g., as entities that are not members of another entity.
Levy, A. (1979), Basic Set Theory, Berlin, New York: Springer-Verlag
The collection of all algebraic structures of a given type will usually be a proper class. Examples include the class of all groups, the class of all vector spaces, and many others. In category theory, a category whose collection of objects forms a proper class (or whose collection of morphisms forms a proper class) is called a large category.
ZF set theory does not formalize the notion of classes, so each formula with classes must be reduced syntactically to a formula without classes.[2]For example, one can reduce the formula A={x∣x=x}{\displaystyle A=\{x\mid x=x\}} to ∀x(x∈A↔x=x){\displaystyle \forall x(x\in A\leftrightarrow x=x)}. Semantically, in a metalanguage, the classes can be described as equivalence classes of logical formulas: If A{\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} is a structure interpreting ZF, then the object language "class-builder expression" {x∣ϕ}{\displaystyle \{x\mid \phi \}} is interpreted in A{\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} by the collection of all the elements from the domain of A{\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} on which λxϕ{\displaystyle \lambda x\phi } holds; thus, the class can be described as the set of all predicates equivalent to ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } (which includes ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } itself). In particular, one can identify the "class of all sets" with the set of all predicates equivalent to x=x.{\displaystyle x=x.}

Morse–Kelley set theory admits proper classes as basic objects, like NBG, but also allows quantification over all proper classes in its class existence axioms. This causes MK to be strictly stronger than both NBG and ZF.

One way to prove that a class is proper is to place it in bijection with the class of all ordinal numbers. This method is used, for example, in the proof that there is no free complete lattice on three or more generators.

In mathematical logic, an uninterpreted function[1] or function symbol[2] is one that has no other property than its name and n-ary form. Function symbols are used, together with constants and variables, to form terms.
The theory of uninterpreted functions is also sometimes called the free theory, because it is freely generated, and thus a free object, or the empty theory, being the theory having an empty set of sentences (in analogy to an initial algebra).Theories with a non-empty set of equations are known as equational theories. The satisfiability problem for free theories is solved by syntactic unification; algorithms for the latter are used by interpreters for various computer languages, such as Prolog. Syntactic unification is also used in algorithms for the satisfiability problem for certain other equational theories, see Unification (computer science).

Π-terms return a type.So what is the type of their return value?Well, there must be a type that contains types.A type that contains other types is called a "universe".It is often written with the symbol U{\displaystyle U}.Sometimes there is a hierarchy of universes, with "U0{\displaystyle U_{0}} : U1{\displaystyle U_{1}}", "U1{\displaystyle U_{1}} : U2{\displaystyle U_{2}}", etc..

A complex type ⟨a,b⟩{\displaystyle \langle a,b\rangle } is the type of functions from entities of type a{\displaystyle a} to entities of type b{\displaystyle b}. Thus one has types like ⟨e,t⟩{\displaystyle \langle e,t\rangle } which are interpreted as elements of the set of functions from entities to truth-values, i.e. indicator functions of sets of entities. An expression of type ⟨⟨e,t⟩,t⟩{\displaystyle \langle \langle e,t\rangle ,t\rangle } is a function from sets of entities to truth-values, i.e. a (indicator function of a) set of sets. This latter type is standardly taken to be the type of natural language quantifiers, likeeverybody ornobody (Montague 1973, Barwise and Cooper 1981).[full citation needed]

Obviously, terms that compute to the same term are equal.So, assuming "x : nat", the terms "x + (1 + 4) : nat" and "x + (4 + 1) : nat" are equal because they both reduce to "x + 5 : nat".When two terms are equal, they can be substituted for each other.Equality is a complex topic in type theory and there are many kinds of equality.This kind of equality, where two terms compute to the same term, is called "judgmental equality".
C-monoids (categories with products and exponentials and one non-terminal object) correspond to the untyped λ-calculus (observed independently by Lambek and Dana Scott around 1980);
"term elimination" rules define the other functions like "first", "second", and "R".
Some combinations of types are equivalent to other combinations of types.When functions are considered "exponentiation", the combinations of types can be written similar to algebraic identities.[10]Thus, 0+A≅A{\displaystyle {\mathbb {0} }+A\cong A}, 1×A≅A{\displaystyle {\mathbb {1} }\times A\cong A}, 1+1≅2{\displaystyle {\mathbb {1} }+{\mathbb {1} }\cong {\mathbb {2} }}, AB+C≅AB×AC{\displaystyle A^{B+C}\cong A^{B}\times A^{C}}, AB×C≅(AB)C{\displaystyle A^{B\times C}\cong (A^{B})^{C}}.
Much of the current research into type theory is driven by proof checkers, interactive proof assistants, and automated theorem provers. Most of these systems use a type theory as the mathematical foundation for encoding proofs, which is not surprising, given the close connection between type theory and programming languages:
Thompson, Simon (1991). Type Theory and Functional Programming. Addison–Wesley. ISBN 0-201-41667-0.
The programming language ML was developed for manipulating type theories (see LCF) and its own type system was heavily influenced by them.
Likewise, there is no double negation.There is no term of type Π A . ((A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →{\displaystyle \to } A.(Note: Intuitionistic logic does allow ¬¬¬A→¬A{\displaystyle \lnot \lnot \lnot A\to \lnot A} and there is a term of type (((A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →{\displaystyle \to } (A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }).)
In type theory, every term has a type.A term and its type are often written together as "term : type". A common type to include in a type theory is the Natural numbers, often written as "N{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }" or "nat".Another is Boolean logic values.So, some very simple terms with their types are:
add : nat→{\displaystyle \to }nat→{\displaystyle \to }nat ::= R (λ n:nat . nat→{\displaystyle \to }nat) (λ n:nat . n) (λ g:nat→{\displaystyle \to }nat . (λ m:nat . S (g m)))
WARNING: This interpretation can lead to a lot of confusion.A type theory may have terms "true" and "false" of type "bool", which act like a Boolean logic, and at the same time have types ⊤{\displaystyle \top } and ⊥{\displaystyle \bot } to represent "true" (provable) and "false" (disproven), as part of a intuitionistic logic for proposition.
⊢{\displaystyle \vdash } S  : nat →{\displaystyle \to } nat
Sometimes, a type theory will add a few axioms.An axiom is a judgement that is accepted without a derivation using the rules of inference.They are often added to ensure properties that cannot be added cleanly through the rules.
The logic operators "for all" and "exists" led Per Martin-Löf to invent dependent type theory.
Earlier, we saw that function application is written by putting the parameter after the function term.So, if we want to call the above function with the parameter "5" of type "nat", we write:
Type theory is also widely used in formal theories of semantics of natural languages,[20][21] especially Montague grammar[22] and its descendants. In particular, categorial grammars and pregroup grammars extensively use type constructors to define the types (noun, verb, etc.) of words.

The judgements enforce that every term has a type.The type will restrict which rules can be applied to a term.

The Boolean type has exactly 2 canonical terms.The type is usually written "bool" or "B{\displaystyle \mathbb {B} }" or "2{\displaystyle \mathbb {2} }".The canonical terms are usually "true" and "false".
Type theory has a built-in notation of computation.The following terms are all different:
In set theory, the Axiom of Choice is an axiom and is controversial, particularly when applied to uncountable sets.In type theory, the equivalent statement is a theorem (type) and is provable (inhabited by a term).
The unit type has exactly 1 canonical term.The type is written "⊤{\displaystyle \top }" or "1{\displaystyle \mathbb {1} }" and the single canonical term is written "*".
If the canonical terms are always "a=a", but "x+1" does not compute to the same term as "1+x", how do we create a term of "x+1 = 1+x"? We use the "R" function.(See §Natural Numbers above.)The "R" function's argument "P" is defined to be "(λ x:nat . x+1 = 1+x)".The other arguments act like the parts of an induction proof, where "PZ : P 0" becomes the base case "0+1 = 1+0" and "PS : P n →{\displaystyle \to } P (S n)" becomes the inductive case.Essentially, this says that when "x+1 = 1+x" has "x" replaced with a canonical value, the expression will be the same as "reflexivity (x+1)".This application of the function "R" has type "x : nat →{\displaystyle \to } x+1 = 1+x".We can use it and the function "J" to substitute "1+x" for "x+1" in any term.In this way, the identity type is able to capture equalities that are not possible with judgmental equality.
Although the initial motivation for category theory was far removed from foundationalism, the two fields turned out to have deep connections. As John Lane Bell writes: "In fact categories can themselves be viewed as type theories of a certain kind; this fact alone indicates that type theory is much more closely related to category theory than it is to set theory." In brief, a category can be viewed as a type theory by regarding its objects as types (or sorts), i.e. "Roughly speaking, a category may be thought of as a type theory shorn of its syntax." A number of significant results follow in this way:[18]
Many programs that work with type theory (e.g., interactive theorem provers) also do type inferencing.It lets them select the rules that the user intends, with fewer actions by the user.
Set theory has set-builder notation.It can create any set that can be defined.This allows it to create Uncountable sets.Type theories are syntactic, which limits them to a countably infinite terms.Additionally, most type theories require computation to always halt and limit themselves to recursively generable terms.As a result, most type theories do not use the Real numbers but the Computable numbers.
Many type theories are supported by LEGO and Isabelle. Isabelle also supports foundations besides type theories, such as ZFC. Mizar is an example of a proof system that only supports set theory.

Type theory was created to avoid a paradox in a mathematical foundation based on naive set theory and formal logic.Russell's paradox, which was discovered by Bertrand Russell, existed because a set could be defined using "all possible sets", which included itself.Between 1902 and 1908, Bertrand Russell proposed various "theories of type" to fix the problem. By 1908 Russell arrived at a "ramified" theory of types together with an "axiom of reducibility" both of which featured prominently in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica published between 1910 and 1913.This system avoided Russell's paradox by creating a hierarchy of types and then assigning each concrete mathematical entity to a type.Entities of a given type are built exclusively of subtypes of that type,[b] thus preventing an entity from being defined using itself. Russell's theory of typesruled out the possibility of a set being a member of itself.
Girard's paradox shows that type inhabitation is strongly related to the consistency of a type system with Curry–Howard correspondence. To be sound, such a system must have uninhabited types.
Because the type can contain computation, dependent typing is amazingly powerful.When mathematicians say "there exists a number x{\displaystyle x} such that x{\displaystyle x} is prime" or "there exists a number x{\displaystyle x} such that property P(x){\displaystyle P(x)} holds", it can be expressed as a dependent type.That is, the property is proven for the specific "x{\displaystyle x}" and that is visible in the type of the result.
nothing except the basic types, and what can be constructed from them by means of the previous clause are types.
Homotopy type theory attempts to combine type theory and category theory.It focuses on equalities, especially equalities between types.
In Julia's type system, for example, abstract types have no subtype[1]: 110  but concrete types are provided for "documentation, optimization, and dispatch".[2]
There are many details to dependent typing.They are too long and complicated for this introduction.See the article on dependent typing and the lambda cube for more information.

"Axiom K" ensures "uniqueness of identity proofs".That is, that every term of an identity type is equal to reflexivity.[12]

Dependent typing is when the type returned by a function depends on the value of its argument.For example, when a type theory has a rule that defines the type "bool", it also defines the function "if".The function "if" takes 3 arguments and "if true b c" computes to "b" and "if false b c" computes to "c".But what is the type of "if a b c"?
Proponents of type theory will also point out its connection to constructive mathematics through the BHK interpretation, its connected to logic by the Curry–Howard isomorphism, and its connections to Category theory.
In set theory, an element is not restricted to one set.The element can appear in subsets and unions with other sets.In type theory, terms (generally) belong to only one type.Where a subset would be used, type theory can use a predicate function or use a dependently-typed product type, where each element x{\displaystyle x} is paired with a proof that the subset's property holds for x{\displaystyle x}.Where a union would be used, type theory uses the sum type, which contains new canonical terms.
Set theory and logic have the law of excluded middle.That is, every theorem is true or false.When a type theory defines the concepts of "and" and "or" as types, it leads to intuitionistic logic, which does not have the law of excluded middle.However, the law can be proven for some types.
The empty type has no terms.The type is usually written "⊥{\displaystyle \bot }" or "0{\displaystyle \mathbb {0} }".
The judgements required to create the lambda term go above the line.In this case, only one judgement is required: it is that there is some term "b" of some type "B", assuming there is some term "a" of some type "A" and some other assumptions "Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }".(Note: "Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }", "a", "A", "b", and "B" are all metavariables in the rule.)The resulting judgement goes below the line.This rule's resulting judgement states that the new lambda term has type "A →{\displaystyle \to } B" under the other assumptions Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }.
When used as a foundation, certain types are interpreted as propositions (statements that can be proven) and a term of the type is a proof of that proposition.Thus, the type "Π x:nat . x+1=1+x" represents that, for any "x" of type "nat", "x+1" and "1+x" are equal.And a term of that type represents its proof.
Any static program analysis, such as the type checking algorithms in the semantic analysis phase of compiler, has a connection to type theory. A prime example is Agda, a programming language which uses UTT (Luo's Unified Theory of dependent Types) for its type system.

The Axiom of Choice does not need to be added to type theory, because in most type theories it can be derived from the rules of inference.This is because of the constructive nature of type theory, where proving that a value exists requires a method to compute the value.The Axiom of Choice is less powerful in type theory than most set theories, because type theory's functions must be computable and, being syntax-driven, the number of terms in a type must be countable.(See Axiom of choice § In constructive mathematics.)
LF is used by Twelf, often to define other type theories;
Terms can be built out of other terms using function calls.In type theory, a function call is called "function application".Function application takes a term of a given type and results in a term of another given type.Function application is written "function argument argument ...", instead of the conventional "function(argument,argument, ...)".For natural numbers, it is possible to define a function called "add" that takes two natural numbers.Thus, some more terms with their types are:
Besides ordered pairs, this type is used for the logical operator "and", because it holds an "A" and a "B".It is also used for intersection, because it holds one of both types.
An identity type requires two terms "a" and "b" of the same type and is written "a = b".So, for "x + 1" and "1 + x", the type would be "x+1 = 1+x".Canonical terms are created with the constructor "reflexivity".The call "reflexivity a" takes a term "a" and returns a canonical term of the type "a = a".
A term in logic is recursively defined as a constant symbol, variable, or a function application, where a term is applied to another term.Some constant symbols will be "0" of the natural numbers, "true" of the Booleans, and functions like "S " and "if".Thus some terms are "0", "(S 0)", "(S (S x))", and "if true 0 (S 0)".

There are similar, more powerful ways to create types.These include induction-recursion and induction-induction.There is also a way to create similar types using only lambda terms, called Scott encoding.
Homotopy type theory differs from intuitionistic type theory mostly by its handling of the equality type.In 2016 cubical type theory was proposed, which is a homotopy type theory with normalization.[16][13]

There are more types than "nat" and "bool".We have already seen the term "add", which is not a "nat", but a function that, when applied to two "nat"s, computes to a "nat".The type of "add" will be covered later.First, we need to describe "computes to" ('↠{\displaystyle \twoheadrightarrow }').
"The Constructive Hilbert Program and the Limits of Martin-Löf Type Theory"
A type theory's rules say what judgements can be made, based on the existence of other judgements.The rules are expressed using a horizontal line, with the required input judgements above the line and the resulting judgement below the line.The rule for creating a lambda term is:
The list ends with "§ inductive types", which is a powerful technique that is able to construct all the other ones in the list.The mathematical foundations used by the proof assistants "Coq" and "Lean" are based on the "Calculus for Inductive Constructions" which is the "Calculus of Constructions" (its "functional core") with inductive types.

The identity type is the third concept of equality in type theory.The first is "notational equality", which is for definitions like "2 : nat ::= (S (S 0))" that have no mathematical meaning but are useful to readers.The second is "judgmental equality", which is when two terms compute to the same term, like "x + (1 + 4)" and "x + (4 + 1)", which both compute to "x + 5".But type theory needs another form of equality, known as the "identity type" or "propositional equality".

That is, the type of the "if" term is either the type of the second or third argument, depending on the value of the first argument.In actuality, "if a B C" isn't defined using "if", but that gets into details too complicated for this introduction.
A type theory usually has a number of rules, including ones to:
But if "b" and "c" have different types, then the type of "if a b c" depends on the value of "a".We use the symbol "Π" to indicate a function that takes an argument and returns a type.Assuming we have some types "B" and C" and "a : bool", "b : B" and "c : C", then

A lambda term looks like "(λ variablename : type1 . term)" and has type "type1 →{\displaystyle \to } type2". The type "type1 →{\displaystyle \to } type2" indicates that the lambda term is a function that takes a parameter of type "type1" and computes to a term of type "type2".The term inside the lambda term must be a value of "type2", assuming the variable has type "type1".
The traditional foundation for mathematics has been set theory paired with a logic.The most common one cited is Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, known as "ZF" or, with the Axiom of choice, "ZFC".Type theories differ from this foundation in a number of ways.

There is a natural relation of types to logical propositions.If "A" is a type representing a proposition, being able to create a function of type "⊤→{\displaystyle \top \to } A" indicates that A has a proof and being able to create the function "A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }" indicates that A does not have a proof.That is, inhabitable types are proven and uninhabitable types are disproven.
The variable name is "x" and the variable has type "nat".The term "(add x x)" has type "nat", assuming "x : nat".Thus, the lambda term has type "nat →{\displaystyle \to } nat", which means if it is given a "nat" as an argument, it will compute to a "nat".Reduction (a.k.a. computation) is defined for lambda terms.When the function is applied (a.k.a. called), the argument is substituted for the parameter.

The Curry–Howard correspondence is the observed similarity between logics and programming languages.The implication in logic, "A →{\displaystyle \to } B" resembles a function from type "A" to type "B".For a variety of logics, the rules are a similar to expression in a programming language's types.The similarity goes farther, as applications of the rules resemble programs in the programming languages.Thus, the correspondence is often summarized as "proofs as programs".

It is possible to add non-constructive features to a type theory, by rule or assumption.These include operators on continuations such as call with current continuation. However, these operators tend to break desirable properties such as canonicity and parametricity.

The reason that this theory needs the identity type is because some equal terms do not compute to the same term.Assuming "x : nat", the terms "x + 1" and "1 + x" do not compute to the same term.Recall that "+" is a notation for the function "add", which is a notation for the function "R".We cannot compute on "R" until the value for "x" is specified and, until it is specified, two different calls to "R" will not compute to the same term.

The natural numbers are defined with an eliminator function "R" that uses recursion to define a function for all nats.It takes a function "P : nat →{\displaystyle \to } U" which is the type of the function to define.It also takes a term "PZ : P 0" which is the value at zero and a function "PS : P n →{\displaystyle \to } P (S n)" which says how to transform the value at "n" into the value at "n + 1".Thus, its computation rules are:
The interplay, known as categorical logic, has been a subject of active research since then; see the monograph of Jacobs (1999) for instance.
"computation" rules specify how computation is performed with the type-specific functions.

In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is the formal presentation of a specific type system,[a] and in general type theory is the academic study of type systems. Some type theories serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation of mathematics. Two influential type theories that were proposed as foundations are Alonzo Church's typed λ-calculus and Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory.Most computerized proof-writing systems use a type theory for their foundation.A common one is Thierry Coquand's Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
If a universe contains itself, it can lead to paradoxes like Girard's Paradox.
"Law of Excluded Middle" is often added to satisfy users who want classical logic, instead of intuitionistic logic.
If there are no assumptions, there will be nothing to the left of the turnstile:
A term without any variables that cannot be reduced further is a "canonical term".All the terms above reduce to "5 : nat", which is a canonical term.The canonical terms of the natural numbers are:
Most type theories do not have axioms.This is because a type theory is defined by its rules of inference.(See "Rules" above).This is a source of confusion for people familiar with Set Theory, where a theory is defined by both the rules of inference for a logic (such as first-order logic) and axioms about sets.
There are many type theories, which makes it difficult to produce a comprehensive taxonomy; this article is not an exhaustive categorization.What follows is an introduction for those unfamiliar with type theory, covering some of the major approaches.

but they all compute to the term "5 : nat".In type theory, we use the words "reduction" and "reduce" to refer to computation.So, we say "0 + 5 : nat" reduces to "5 : nat".It can be written "0 + 5 : nat ↠{\displaystyle \twoheadrightarrow } 5 : nat".The computation is mechanical, accomplished by rewriting the term's syntax.
Types were not always used in logic.There were other techniques to avoid Russell's paradox.[3] Types did gain a hold when used with one particular logic, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus.
The openendedness of Martin-Löf type theory is particularly manifest in the introduction of so-called universes. Type universes encapsulate the informal notion of reflection whose role may be explained as follows. During the course of developing a particular formalization of type theory, the type theorist may look back over the rules for types, say C, which have been introduced hitherto and perform the step of recognizing that they are valid according to Martin-Löf’s informal semantics of meaning explanation. This act of 'introspection' is an attempt to become aware of the conceptions which have governed our constructions in the past. It gives rise to a "reflection principle which roughly speaking says whatever we are used to doing with types can be done inside a universe" (Martin-Löf 1975, 83). On the formal level, this leads to an extension of the existing formalization of type theory in that the type forming capacities of C become enshrined in a type universe UC mirroring C.
A lambda term is often called an "anonymous function" because it has no name.Often, to make things easier to read, a name is given to a lambda term.This is merely a notation and has no mathematical meaning.Some authors call it "notational equality".A name might be given to the function above using the notation:
A type theory is a mathematical logic.It is a collection of rules of inference that result in judgments.Most logics have judgments asserting "The term x{\displaystyle x} is true", or "The term x{\displaystyle x} is a well-formed formula".[6]A type theory has additional judgments that define types and relate terms to types.
An example of a lambda term is this function which doubles its argument:
^ "Axioms and Computation". Theorem Proving in Lean. Retrieved 21 January 2022.
To generate a particular judgement in type theory, there must be a rule to generate it.Then, there must be rules to generate all of that rule's required inputs.And then rules for all the inputs for those rules.The applied rules form a proof tree.This is usually drawn Gentzen-style,[7] where the target judgement (root) is at the bottom, and rules that do not require any inputs (leaves) are at the top (see Natural deduction §Proofs and type theory). One example of a rule that does not require any inputs is one that states there is a term "0" of type "nat":
In the last term, parentheses were added to indicate the order of operations.Technically, most type theories require the parentheses to be present for every operation, but, in practice, they are not written and authors assume readers can use precedence and associativity to know where they are.For similar ease, it is a common notation to write "x+y{\displaystyle x+y}" instead of "add x{\displaystyle x} y{\displaystyle y}".So, the above terms might be rewritten as:
Constructive mathematics has often used intutionistic logic, as evidenced by the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation.
When some types are interpreted as propositions, there is a set of common types that can be used to connect them to make a logic out of types.However, that logic is not classical logic but intuitionistic logic.That is, it does not have the law of excluded middle nor double negation.

Terms usually belong to a single type.However, there are set theories that define "subtyping".
The rules are syntactic and work by rewriting.Thus, the metavariables like "Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }", "a", "A", etc. may actually consist of complex terms that contain many function applications, not just single symbols.
The most famous early example is Church's simply typed lambda calculus. Church's theory of types[4] helped the formal system avoid the Kleene–Rosser paradox that afflicted the original untyped lambda calculus. Church demonstrated that it could serve as a foundation of mathematics and it was referred to as a higher-order logic.
Terms may also contain variables.Variables always have a type.So, assuming "x" and "y" are variables of type "nat", the following are also valid terms:
But under this interpretation, there is no law of excluded middle.That is, there is no term of type Π A . A + (A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }).
Use of inductive types is a way to create a large variety of types.In fact, all the types described above and more can be defined using the rules of inductive types.Once the type's constructors are specified, the eliminator functions and computation is determined by structural recursion.
The judgements can be made under an assumption.For example, one might say "assuming x{\displaystyle x} is a term of type 'bool' and y{\displaystyle y} is a term of type 'nat' , (if x y y) is a term of type 'nat' ".The mathematical notation for assumptions is a comma-separated list of "term : type" that precedes the turnstile symbol '⊢{\displaystyle \vdash }'.Thus, the example statement is formally written:

Computation with the identity type is done with the eliminator function "J".The function "J" lets a term dependent on "a", "b", and a term of type "a = b" to be rewritten so that "b" is replaced by "a".While "J" is one directional, only able to substitute "b" with "a", it can be proven that the identity type is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
If a type theory has dependent typing, it has dependent pairs.In a dependent pair, the second type depends on the value of the first term.Thus, the type is written "Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } a:A . B(a)" where "B" has type "A →{\displaystyle \to } U".It is useful when showing existence of an "a" with property "B(a)".
Gregory Bateson introduced a theory of logical types into the social sciences; his notions of double bind and logical levels are based on Russell's theory of types.
The natural numbers are usually implemented in the style of Peano Arithmetic.There is a canonical term, "0 : nat" for zero.Canonical values larger than zero use the constructor function "S : nat →{\displaystyle \to } nat".Thus, "S 0" is one."S (S 0)" is two."S (S (S 0)))" is three.Etc.The decimal numbers are just notationally equal to those terms.

The list of assumptions is called the "context".It is very common to see the symbol 'Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }' used to represent some or all of the assumptions.Thus, the formal notation for the 4 different judgements is usually:
It is used to show that something is uncomputable.If for a type "A", you can create a function of type "A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }", you know that "A" has no terms.An example for the type "A" might be "there exists a number x{\displaystyle x} such that both x{\displaystyle x} is even and x{\displaystyle x} is odd".(See "§Product Type" below for how the example "A" is constructed.)When a type has no terms, we say it is "uninhabited".
The sum type is used for logical or and for union.

Type theories are defined by their rules of inference.There are rules for a "§ functional core", described above, and rules that create types and terms.Below is a non-exhaustive list of common types and their associated terms.
The sum type is a "tagged union".That is, for types "A" and "B", the type "A + B" holds either a term of type "A" or a term of type "B" and it knows which one it holds.The type comes with the constructors "injectionLeft" and "injectionRight". The call "injectionLeft a" takes "a : A" and returns a canonical term of type "A + B".Similarly, injectionRight b" takes "b : B" and returns a canonical term of type "A + B".The type is defined with an eliminator function "match" such that for a type "C" and functions "f : A →{\displaystyle \to } C" and "g : B →{\displaystyle \to } C":
The most common construction takes the basic types e{\displaystyle e} and t{\displaystyle t} for individuals and truth-values, respectively, and defines the set of types recursively as follows:
The product type has terms that are ordered pairs.For types "A" and "B", the product type is written "A ×{\displaystyle \times } B".Canonical terms are created by the constructor function "pair".The terms are "pair a b", where "a" is a term of type "A" and "b" is a term of type "B".The product type is defined with eliminator functions "first" and "second" such that:
Set theory usually encodes numbers as sets.(0 is the empty set, 1 is a set containing the empty set, etc.See Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers.) Type theory can encode numbers as functions using Church encoding or more naturally as inductive types.The constructors "0" and "S" created by the inductive type closely resemble Peano's axioms.
many type theories which fall under higher-order logic are used by the HOL family of provers and PVS;
Axioms can cause problems if they introduce terms without a way to compute on those terms.That is, axioms can interfere with the normalizing property of the type theory.[11]
It is possible to include the law of excluded middle and double negation into a type theory, by rule or assumption.However, terms may not compute down to canonical terms and it will interfere with the ability to determine if two terms are judgementally equal to each other.
In type theory, proofs are mathematical objects.The type "x+1 = 1+x" cannot be used unless there is a term of the type.That term represents a proof that "x+1 = 1+x".Thus, type theory opens up proofs to be studied as mathematical objects.

The lambda term was type "nat →{\displaystyle \to } nat", which meant that given a "nat" as an argument, it will produce a term of type "nat".Since we have given it the argument "5", the above term has type "nat".Reduction works by substituting the argument "5" for the parameter "x" in the term "(add x x)", so the term computes to:
The unit type is used to show that something exists or is computable.If for a type "A", you can create a function of type "⊤→{\displaystyle \top \to } A", you know that "A" has one or more terms.When a type has at least 1 term, we say it is "inhabited".

Per Martin-Löf proposed his intuitionistic type theory as a foundation for constructive mathematics.Constructive mathematics requires when proving "There exists an x{\displaystyle x} with property P(x{\displaystyle x})", there must be a particular x{\displaystyle x} and a proof that it has property "P".In type theory, existence is accomplished using the dependent product type and, its proof, requires a term of that type.For the term t{\displaystyle t}, "first t{\displaystyle t}" will produce the x{\displaystyle x} and "second t{\displaystyle t}" will produce the proof of P(x{\displaystyle x}).
Computation takes place by repeated application of rules.Many type theories are strongly normalizing, which means that any order of applying the rules will always end in the same result.However, some are not.In a normalizing type theory, the one-directional computation rules are called "reduction rules", and applying the rules "reduces" the term.If a rule is not one-directional, it is called a "conversion rule".

Set theory has both rules and axioms, while type theories only have rules.Set theories are built on top of logic.Thus, ZFC is defined by both the rules of first-order logic and its own axioms.(An axiom is a logical statement accepted as true without a logical derivation.)Type theories, in general, do not have axioms and are defined by their rules of inference.

To be clear, it is possible to create the type "0 = 1", but there will not be a way to create terms of that type.Without a term of type "0 = 1", it will not be possible to use the function "J" to substitute "0" for "1" in another term.
An example of a non-constructive proof is a "proof by contradiction".The first step is assuming that x{\displaystyle x} does not exist and refuting it by contradiction.The conclusion from that step is "it is not the case that x{\displaystyle x} does not exist".The last step is, by double negation, concluding that x{\displaystyle x} exists.To be clear, constructive mathematics still allows "refute by contradiction".It can prove that "it is not the case that x{\displaystyle x} does not exist".But constructive mathematics does not allow the last step of removing the double negation to conclude that x{\displaystyle x} exists.[17]
Terms that contain variables can be reduced too.So the term "x + (1 + 4) : nat" reduces to "x + 5 : nat".(We can reduce any sub-term within a term, thanks to the Church-Rosser theorem.)

The phrase "type theory" now generally refers to a typed system based around lambda calculus.One influential system is Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory, which was proposed as a foundation for constructive mathematics. Another is Thierry Coquand's calculus of constructions, which is used as the foundation by Coq, Lean, and other "proof assistants" (computerized proof writing programs).Type theories are an area of active research, as demonstrated by homotopy type theory.
Type theory has connections to other areas of mathematics.Proponents of type theory as a foundation often mention these connections as justification for its use.
Mathematicians working in category theory already had difficulty working with the widely accepted foundation of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. This led to proposals such as Lawvere's Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (ETCS).[19] Homotopy type theory continues in this line using type theory. Researchers are exploring connections between dependent types (especially the identity type) and algebraic topology (specifically homotopy).

In logic and linguistics, a metalanguage is a language used to describe another language, often called the object language.[1] Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in the object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line.[citation needed] The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a metasyntax.[2] For example, to say that the word "noun" can be used as a noun in a sentence, one could write "noun" is a .
Since all of these metalanguages are sublanguages of L0{\displaystyle L_{0}}, L1{\displaystyle L_{1}} is a nested metalanguage, but L2{\displaystyle L_{2}} and sequel are ordered metalanguages.[5] Since all these metalanguages are sublanguages of L0{\displaystyle L_{0}} they are all embedded languages with respect to the language as a whole.
Baldick, C. 1996. Oxford Concise Dictionary of Literary Terms. Oxford: Oxford University Press.
Metalanguages of formal systems all resolve ultimately to natural language, the 'common parlance' in which mathematicians and logicians converse to define their terms and operations and 'read out' their formulae.[6]

An ordered metalanguage is analogous to an ordered logic. An example of an ordered metalanguage is the construction of one metalanguage to discuss an object language, followed by the creation of another metalanguage to discuss the first, etc.
A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory (a theory about a theory). Statements made in the metatheory about the theory are called metatheorems. A metatheorem is a true statement about a formal system expressed in a metalanguage. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a metatheory, and may reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the object theory.[8]

There are a variety of recognized types of metalanguage, including embedded, ordered, and nested (or hierarchical) metalanguages.
An embedded metalanguage is a language formally, naturally and firmly fixed in an object language. This idea is found in Douglas Hofstadter's book, Gödel, Escher, Bach, in a discussion of the relationship between formal languages and number theory: "... it is in the nature of any formalization of number theory that its metalanguage is embedded within it."[3]
The paradigmatic example of a nested metalanguage comes from the Linnean taxonomic system in biology. Each level in the system incorporates the one below it. The language used to discuss genus is also used to discuss species; the one used to discuss orders is also used to discuss genera, etc., up to kingdoms.
It occurs in natural, or informal, languages, as well—such as in English, where words such as noun, verb, or even word describe features and concepts pertaining to the English language itself.

A nested (or hierarchical) metalanguage is similar to an ordered metalanguage in that each level represents a greater degree of abstraction. However, a nested metalanguage differs from an ordered one in that each level includes the one below.

When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.
Almost every modern mathematical theory starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was[further explanation needed] thought[citation needed] that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.

Other axiom schemata involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed.[13]
In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any collection of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow – by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be consistent; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axioms. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.
An axiom, postulate, or assumption is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Ancient Greek word ἀξίωμα (axíōma), meaning 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident'.[1][2]
Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
^ "A proposition that commends itself to general acceptance; a well-established or universally conceded principle; a maxim, rule, law" axiom, n., definition 1a. Oxford English Dictionary Online, accessed 2012-04-28. Cf. Aristotle, Posterior Analytics I.2.72a18-b4.
Thus, an axiom is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the rules of inference define a deductive system.
The standard structure is N=⟨N,0,S⟩{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {N}}=\langle \mathbb {N} ,0,S\rangle } where N{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } is the set of natural numbers, S{\displaystyle S} is the successor function and 0{\displaystyle 0} is naturally interpreted as the number 0.
that is, for any statement that is a logical consequence of Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } there actually exists a deduction of the statement from Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma }.This is sometimes expressed as "everything that is true is provable", but it must be understood that "true" here means "made true by the set of axioms", and not, for example, "true in the intended interpretation". Gödel's completeness theorem establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.

The Peano axioms are the most widely used axiomatization of first-order arithmetic.They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about number theory and they allowed Gödel to establish his famous second incompleteness theorem.[16]
Early mathematicians regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of physical space, and obviously, there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as Boolean algebra made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. Galois showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details, and modern algebra was born.In the modern view, axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.
See for example Maddy, Penelope (June 1988). "Believing the Axioms, I". Journal of Symbolic Logic. 53 (2): 481–511. doi:10.2307/2274520. JSTOR 2274520. for a realist view.
The ancient Greeks considered geometry as just one of several sciences, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's posterior analytics is a definitive exposition of the classical view.
It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are "propositions that are regarded as true without proof." Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.
Each of these patterns is an axiom schema, a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.For example, if A{\displaystyle A}, B{\displaystyle B}, and C{\displaystyle C} are propositional variables, then A→(B→A){\displaystyle A\to (B\to A)} and (A→¬B)→(C→(A→¬B)){\displaystyle (A\to \lnot B)\to (C\to (A\to \lnot B))} are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and modus ponens, one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with modus ponens.
Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as axioms in mathematical discourse.This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.For example, in some groups, the group operation is commutative, and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom, we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.
Although not complete; some of the stated results did not actually follow from the stated postulates and common notions.
As a matter of facts, the role of axioms in mathematics and postulates in experimental sciences is different. In mathematics one neither "proves" nor "disproves" an axiom. A set of mathematical axioms gives a set of rules that fix a conceptual realm, in which the theorems logically follow. In contrast, in experimental sciences, a set of postulates shall allow deducing results that match or do not match experimental results. If postulates do not allow deducing experimental predictions, they do not set a scientific conceptual framework and have to be completed or made more accurate. If the postulates allow deducing predictions of experimental results, the comparison with experiments allows falsifying (falsified) the theory that the postulates install. A theory is considered valid as long as it has not been falsified.

In the field of mathematical logic, a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: logical and non-logical (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between "axioms" and "postulates" respectively).
Note that "completeness" has a different meaning here than it does in the context of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, which states that no recursive, consistent set of non-logical axioms Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } of the Theory of Arithmetic is complete, in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } such that neither ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } nor ¬ϕ{\displaystyle \lnot \phi } can be proved from the given set of axioms.
In propositional logic it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where ϕ{\displaystyle \phi }, χ{\displaystyle \chi }, and ψ{\displaystyle \psi } can be any formulae of the language and where the included primitive connectives are only "¬{\displaystyle \neg }" for negation of the immediately following proposition and "→{\displaystyle \to }" for implication from antecedent to consequent propositions:
Basic theories, such as arithmetic, real analysis and complex analysis are often introduced non-axiomatically, but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with choice, abbreviated ZFC, or some very similar system of axiomatic set theory like Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, a conservative extension of ZFC. Sometimes slightly stronger theories such as Morse–Kelley set theory or set theory with a strongly inaccessible cardinal allowing the use of a Grothendieck universe is used, but in fact, most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than ZFC, such as second-order arithmetic.[citation needed]
The objectives of the study are within the domain of real numbers.The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to isomorphism) by the properties of a Dedekind complete ordered field, meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires the use of second-order logic. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorems tell us that if we restrict ourselves to first-order logic, any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.Some of the latter are studied in non-standard analysis.

A lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, propositions, theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for primitive notions, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. Alessandro Padoa, Mario Pieri, and Giuseppe Peano were pioneers in this movement.

The logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments (syllogisms, rules of inference) was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics. Tautologies excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are thus the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions (theorems, in the case of mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms axiom and postulate hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for Aristotle and Euclid.[6]

These axiom schemata are also used in the predicate calculus, but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus.[14]

It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of natural numbers, an infinite but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory. Furthermore, using techniques of forcing (Cohen) one can show that the continuum hypothesis (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms.[12] Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.

Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of logic. Frege, Russell, Poincaré, Hilbert, and Gödel are some of the key figures in this development.

Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. field theory, group theory, topology, vector spaces) without any particular application in mind. The distinction between an "axiom" and a "postulate" disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate, one can get theories that have meaning in wider contexts (e.g., hyperbolic geometry). As such, one must simply be prepared to use labels such as "line" and "parallel" with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that it is useful to regard postulates as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.
Experimental sciences - as opposed to mathematics and logic - also have general founding assertions from which a deductive reasoning can be built so as to express propositions that predict properties - either still general or much more specialized to a specific experimental context. For instance, Newton's laws in classical mechanics, Maxwell's equations in classical electromagnetism, Einstein's equation in general relativity, Mendel's laws of genetics, Darwin's Natural selection law, etc. These founding assertions are usually called principles or postulates so as to distinguish from mathematical axioms.
This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.
Wolff, P. Breakthroughs in Mathematics, 1963, New York: New American Library, pp 47–48
The classical approach is well-illustrated[a] by Euclid's Elements, where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of "common notions" (very basic, self-evident assertions).

Any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be "true" is a subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics.[5]
At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses that were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a postulate. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.[9]

A deductive system consists of a set Λ{\displaystyle \Lambda } of logical axioms, a set Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } of non-logical axioms, and a set {(Γ,ϕ)}{\displaystyle \{(\Gamma ,\phi )\}} of rules of inference.A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be complete.A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas ϕ{\displaystyle \phi },
^ Although not complete; some of the stated results did not actually follow from the stated postulates and common notions.
Ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting on Euclid's books, Proclus remarks that "Geminus held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property."[8] Boethius translated 'postulate' as petitio and called the axiomsnotiones communes but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.
Hilbert also made explicit the assumptions that Euclid used in his proofs but did not list in his common notions and postulates.
When mathematicians employ the field axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.
Where the symbol ϕtx{\displaystyle \phi _{t}^{x}} stands for the formula ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } with the term t{\displaystyle t} substituted for x{\displaystyle x}. (See Substitution of variables.) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property P{\displaystyle P} holds for every x{\displaystyle x} and that t{\displaystyle t} stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim P(t){\displaystyle P(t)}. Again, we are claiming that the formula ∀xϕ→ϕtx{\displaystyle \forall x\phi \to \phi _{t}^{x}} is valid, that is, we must be able to give a "proof" of this fact, or more properly speaking, a metaproof.These examples are metatheorems of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of proof itself. Aside from this, we can also have Existential Generalization:
Non-logical axioms may also be called "postulates" or "assumptions". In most cases, a non-logical axiom is simply a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory, and might or might not be self-evident in nature (e.g., the parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry). To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms), and there are typically many ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.
The word axiom comes from the Greek word ἀξίωμα (axíōma), a verbal noun from the verb ἀξιόειν (axioein), meaning "to deem worthy", but also "to require", which in turn comes from ἄξιος (áxios), meaning "being in balance", and hence "having (the same) value (as)", "worthy", "proper". Among the ancient Greek philosophers an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be self-evidently true without any need for proof.[6]
Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 Euclid's postulates of plane geometry.The axioms are referred to as "4 + 1" because for nearly two millennia the fifth (parallel) postulate ("through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel") was suspected of being derivable from the first four.Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four. One can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists, or that infinitely many exist.This choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to exactly 180 degrees or less, respectively, and are known as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries. If one also removes the second postulate ("a line can be extended indefinitely") then elliptic geometry arises, where there is no parallel through a point outside a line, and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.

The precise definition varies across fields of study. In classic philosophy, an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question.[3] In modern logic, an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.[4]

^ Mendelson, "3. First-Order Theories: Proper Axioms" of Ch. 2
In mathematics, an axiom may be a "logical axiom" or a "non-logical axiom". Logical axioms are taken to be true within the system of logic they define and are often shown in symbolic form (e.g., (A and B) implies A), while non-logical axioms (e.g., a + b = b + a) are substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory, such as arithmetic.
"A proposition that commends itself to general acceptance; a well-established or universally conceded principle; a maxim, rule, law" axiom, n., definition 1a. Oxford English Dictionary Online, accessed 2012-04-28. Cf. Aristotle, Posterior Analytics I.2.72a18-b4.
In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on Cantor's set theory. Here, the emergence of Russell's paradox and similar antinomies of naïve set theory raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.
This means that, for any variable symbol x,{\displaystyle x\,,} the formula x=x{\displaystyle x=x} can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of "primitive notions", either a precise notion of what we mean by x=x{\displaystyle x=x}(or, for that matter, "to be equal") has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol ={\displaystyle =}has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that.
Non-logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.Reasoning about two different structures, for example, the natural numbers and the integers, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as groups).Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not tautologies.Another name for a non-logical axiom is postulate.[15]
On an Evolutionist Theory of Axioms: inaugural lecture delivered October 15, 1889
Another, more interesting example axiom scheme, is that which provides us with what is known as Universal Instantiation:
An "axiom", in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that
The root meaning of the word postulate is to "demand"; for instance, Euclid demands that one agree that some things can be done (e.g., any two points can be joined by a straight line).[7]
In quantum physics, two sets of postulates have coexisted for some time, which provide a very nice example of falsification. The 'Copenhagen school' (Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born) developed an operational approach with a complete mathematical formalism that involves the description of quantum system by vectors ('states') in a separable Hilbert space, and physical quantities as linear operators that act in this Hilbert space. This approach is fully falsifiable and has so far produced the most accurate predictions in physics. But it has the unsatisfactory aspect of not allowing answers to questions one would naturally ask. For this reason, another 'hidden variables' approach was developed for some time by Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, David Bohm. It was created so as to try to give deterministic explanation to phenomena such as entanglement. This approach assumed that the Copenhagen school description was not complete, and postulated that some yet unknown variable was to be added to the theory so as to allow answering some of the questions it does not answer (the founding elements of which were discussed as the EPR paradox in 1935). Taking this ideas seriously, John Bell derived in 1964 a prediction that would lead to different experimental results (Bell's inequalities) in the Copenhagen and the Hidden variable case. The experiment was conducted first by Alain Aspect in the early 1980's, and the result excluded the simple hidden variable approach (sophisticated hidden variables could still exist but their properties would still be more disturbing than the problems they try to solve). This does not mean that the conceptual framework of quantum physics can be considered as complete now, since some open questions still exist (the limit between the quantum and classical realms, what happens during a quantum measurement, what happens in a completely closed quantum system such as the universe itself, etc).
There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of completeness of a deductive system and on the other hand that of completeness of a set of non-logical axioms.The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.
It is true that all right angles are equal to one another.
The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 Gödel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms (Peano's axioms, for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a corollary, Gödel proved that the consistency of a theory like Peano arithmetic is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.[11]
It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization[b] of Euclidean geometry,[10] and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.
These are certain formulas in a formal language that are universally valid, that is, formulas that are satisfied by every assignment of values.Usually one takes as logical axioms at least some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all tautologies in the language; in the case of predicate logic more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove logical truths that are not tautologies in the strict sense.
It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any other point.
This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including measure theory, ergodic theory, probability, representation theory, and differential geometry.

Another lesson learned in modern mathematics is to examine purported proofs carefully for hidden assumptions.
