The film is set in the haunted streets of Hong Kong, with four loosely connected stories put together in one film. A group of youngsters go on a camping trip in the countryside, where Ken encounters a mysterious woman near a grave. After the encounter, his life changes as he becomes a victim of the supernatural. As his friends return to Hong Kong without him, another story begins. Mrs To has made arrangements to celebrate her wedding anniversary with her husband but he does not show up. The outcome of the second story leads to another story about Ken's friend, Jojo, having a romantic affair with a ghost. The fourth story is about Peter Butt visiting a haunted theatre with some of Ken's friends.

In 1971, Law Lan joined TVB and took part in numerous drama series. Here, she played a variety of different characters instead of only being cast in antagonistic roles as she had previously. She also took part in the popular nightly variety show, Enjoy Yourself Tonight, which included skits, singing, dancing, and variety games, filmed in front of a live audience.
As well, Law Lan has been popularly cast playing roles as a supernatural medium in over 36 Hong Kong horror movies, despite the fact that she is a devout Roman Catholic. It was her performance as 四婆 (which is fourth granny literally) in the movie, Bullets Over Summer, which garnered her the "Best Actress" award at the 19th Hong Kong Film Award in 2000, making her the oldest winner of this coveted award.[4]

She first started out in the film industry in 1939, cast in antagonistic roles during the black and white film era. It was during this time that she took the stage name of "Law Lan" based on the advice of her boss because he said the name was reminiscent of Shanghai socialites (交際花), and this name better suited the type of roles that she played.[3]

Laughing is supposedly an undercover cop who has infiltrated a triad organization. However, before he became a cop, Laughing was a member of the triads and worked for the triad leader Lai Tin-yat, aka Brother One (Anthony Wong).

In order to strengthen his business and illegal activities, Brother One arranges for Laughing to join the Police Force and become his mole to gather information about the plans and counter-plans for operations by the police.

Alan Chui Chung-San as Master Da, a Taiwanese drug dealer with whom Brother One collaborates and speaks Hokkien.
Sung Poon-chung as a robber who attempted to rob Laughing while the latter was working as a clerk in a convenience store.
Laughing was shown to join the police academy for his idealism for justice and honor. His motivations also convinced his girlfriend, Wendy, to also join the academy to become good peacekeepers; the movie replaces his original undercover recruiter, officer Kwok Pui,with officer Sin. Wendy's involvement in E.U. was ignored in the movie.

Fala Chen as Karen, Zatoi's younger sister, who is a college student. Zatoi is very protective of Karen and was enraged to find out she was dating Laughing, a triad member.
Laughing's diary clearly mentions his 10-year stint undercover was largely involved in To Yik-tin's triad to expose their activities; the film mentions his involvement with another triad that greatly conflicts with the time-line within his diary.

The production company that produced Turning Point made the unusual decision to exclude the very story writers of E.U. to have another group to fill in Laughing's prequel story. Due to the lack of consideration of canon, a series of plot conflicts between the series and movie were revealed. Most of the established lore of Laughing in E.U. were ignored and replaced by an alternate reality time line of Laughing's life as an undercover cop:
Kenny Wong as Cheh Chai (車仔), one of Brother One's underlings who is actually an undercover cop (PC4278).
Michael Tse as Leung Siu-tong (梁笑棠), nicknamed Laughing, the main protagonist of the film, a store clerk who becomes Brother One's underling after the latter saved him from robbers. Laughing was later planted by Brother One as a mole into the police force, only for Superintednent Sin to assign him on as an undercover cop in Ching Hing Society, working as a double-undercover, eventually turning against Brother One.
The story takes place before the early year of 2000 when Laughing (Michael Tse) is an undercover cop,but because of a drug case, Inspector Poon (Felix Wong) has been trying to track him down.
Laughing graduated from Police Academy with outstanding results but before he was assigned to a post as a police officer, his "bad boy" image attracted the attention of the Head of District Anti-Triad Squad, Superintendent Sin (Yuen Biao) who arranges his assignment as an undercover cop to infiltrate the mob syndicate.
Michael Tse's performance as "Laughing Gor" in the TVB television serial E.U was well received, and due to his popularity, TVB general manager Stephen Chan Chi-wan, during an interview with Tse in Be My Guest on 1 April 2009, announced that a prequel/spin-off featuring "Laughing Gor" would be made and presented Tse a contract for the film.
In E.U. when Laughing met Hau, he was bald, but in Turning Point he wasn't.
Ron Ng as a police constable (PC26168) whom Laughing humiliates near end of the film.
On 1 August 2011, Lives of Omission, a distant television sequel, premiered on TVB Jade. On 29 December of the same year, Turning Point 2, a direct film sequel to Lives of Omission, was theatrically released.
Lin Chi-hung as one of Laughing's underlings after he becomes a triad leader in his second undercover mission.
Koni Lui as one of Brother One's girlfriends who is also his accountant.
The 5 dollar HK coin Laughing was given to him by Brother One, but in E.U. it was just an ordinary coin Laughing was going to give Wendy just to buy a drink.
Johnson Lee as Child (阿巢), one of Zatoi's underlings who work as Brother One's mole.

Laughing is now a "double" agent. Brother One was happy with this turn of events as Laughing was assigned to infiltrate the mob of his triad rival sibling Zatoi (Francis Ng), who tries to make life difficult for Laughing. To further complicate the situation, Laughing falls in love with Zatoi's sister, Karen (Fala Chen).
The movie revolves more of Laughing's life as an underling rather than a gang boss.
Hong Kong movies make a dramatic showing at the box office
Due to Laughing's character already flavoured among local audiences, the film performed outstanding in Hong Kong's Box office, earning $675,295 in 35 screenings with $19,294 per average topping the charts during its opening weekend.[2] Till today, the film finally grossed US$2,020,712 [3] (HK 15.7 million), one of the four domestic films to be placing into the top 10 in the summer.[4]

The original run of films lasted between 1997 and 2003[2] and had 19 films.[3] which means that the original Troublesome Night spawned more sequels than any other horror film at the time. The first six films were directed by Herman Yau but after that he lost interest and producer Nam Yin kept the series alive.[4] A 20th installment was released in 2017 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first film.
