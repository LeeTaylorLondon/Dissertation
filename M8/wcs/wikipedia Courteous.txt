I think there may be some kind of gesture puzzle in Sellia Crystal Tunnel that i couldnt find mentioned anywhere. in the room with the faithful canvas talisman, if you notice the kindred of rot before they attack, they seem to be worshipping the empty alter in front of them. I though this was strange so after killing them i jumped up onto the alter using the barrel and mimicked them using the erudition gesture. there was a strange humming noise that started but nothing happened. perhaps you need to wear a specific armor piece or something like the tower puzzle for the same gesture? or does this strange hum happen everywhere you use the gesture?

We get fourteen different cries/yells that all mean the same thing but the ‘no’ gesture from DS2 hasn’t been seen since. Just like most other people I CoOp with, I don’t understand what From is thinking.
As much as I like the gestures in this game they're missing out on gestures for several types of characters.For example I made a Barbarian type character and the only gestures that seem to be appropriate are Fire Spur Me and Triumphant Delight.No Roar?No bellowing at the sky?Or maybe a double chest beat?That would be awesome, I hope Fromsoft is adding more gestures for DLC.

Even if someone is awkward with using gestures, I’ll take a happy jump, running in circles, or even a swift crouch over a Host looking away after I help them finish the boss. Ah, well… There’s a couple of times where I died a heartbeat before boss, and the Host ran over to were I died and just stood there. It said it all, without gestures.
It’s actually a crime you cannot unlock the dance the people are doing up by the windmills in Altus.
Gestures in Elden Ring are a useful tool to express yourself to other players, some including a vocal performance or making sound. Up to six can be bound to a shortcut menu just below the pouch.

Random tangent: Its a blessing that fromsoftware characters hasn't made an appearance in fortnite. Gehrman, Artorias & Gwyn doing some braindead fortnite dance would be a questionable decision on from's part that would make us question what Miyazaki was on

I don't know where else to ask this, but I'm wondering about gestures beyond the ones listed here: running in circles, wagging shields or weapons, etc. (feel free to add anything) I love the multiplayer energy, but sometimes I wish I knew what exactly I'm communicating.
Darn it I missed bravo and now I can't get it

If Rodrika is missed at the shack, and the first time you meet her is in the roundtable, can you still get the sitting sideways gesture?
Anonymous26 Apr 2022 22:26  As much as I like the gestures in this game they're missing out on gestures for several types of characters.For example I made a Barbarian type character and the only gestures that seem to be appropriate are Fire Spur Me and Triumphant Delight.No Roar?No bellowing at the sky?Or maybe a double chest beat?That would be awesome, I hope Fromsoft is adding more gestures for DLC.ReplyReplies (0)6+13-1 Submit
On the patches page it mentions to do the "grovel" gesture. And specifically not the "grovel for mercy". Does anyone know how to obtain the "grovel" gesture??

Hi, I bought the game as a preorder from a retailer, but I didn't get THE RING gesture. My game is Launch Edition. I guess it doesn't count as an actual preorder? By the way, does it have to be a boss in your world, or can you just put down your sign and kill a boss in someone else's world to get the gesture? Thanks.

I got the balled up gesture even though I have never undergone rebirth, there must be something incorrect here.
