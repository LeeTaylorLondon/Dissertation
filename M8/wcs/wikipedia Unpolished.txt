Rough tells the story of Keisuke Yamato, a 100 m freestyle swimmer, and Ami Ninomiya, a competitive diver as they overcome their family rivalry and fall in love with each other over the course of their high school years.[1] Their families own competing confectionery stores and Ami has grown up hating Keisuke's family because her family believes her grandfather was driven to an early death after Keisuke's grandfather copied their signature "horned owl" manju and outsold them simply by adding "ears," making it that much larger.[2]

In filmmaking, the rough cut is the second of three stages of offline editing. The term originates from the early days of filmmaking when film stock was physically cut and reassembled, but is still used to describe projects that are recorded and edited digitally.
Benjamin Craig, "What is the difference between online and offline editing?" filmmaking.net
Digitizing: Ingesting the material into a digital computer allows the footage to be handled much more simply than when it is on its original tape or film form.
Final cut: The final sequence of images and sound are selected and put in order.

The rough cut is the first stage in which the film begins to resemble its final product. Rough cuts are recognizable as a conventional film, but may have notable errors or defects, may not have the desired narrative flow from scene to scene, may lack soundtrack music, sound effects or visual effects, and still undergo many significant changes before the release of the film.[1][2]
A number of the preliminary stages can be undertaken by lower cost staff, or people less skilled in using expensive and sophisticated editing equipment (such as those who are not directors). With the advent of digital video editing software and non-linear editing systems (NLE), films or television shows go through a number of stages.
Initial Assembly: The selected shots are moved from the order they are filmed in into the approximate order they will appear in the final cut.
Mix: Audio is finished by a specialist with equipment in acoustically treated rooms.

Yellowcard released their first two albums – Midget Tossing (1997) and Where We Stand (1999) – through guitarist Ben Harper's label Takehold Records. Following this, vocalist Ben Dobson was replaced by Ryan Key in early 2000.[1] Key had played shows with Yellowcard while in the high school act Modern Music; Takehold had previously released a cassette for Modern Music.[2] Bassist Warren Cooke's brother was close friends with Stevan Lubarsky, who ran the Californian-based label Lobster Records.[1] On June 15, 2000, Yellowcard signed to Lobster Records, and were aiming to release their next album in early 2001.[3] The band moved from their native Florida to Thousand Oaks, California to record the album.[4] Sessions where held at Stall No. 2 in Redondo Beach, California, with producer and engineer Darian Rundall. He mixed the recordings, before the album was mastered by Mark Chalecki at Capitol Records in Hollywood, California.[5]
In a 2011 interview, violinist Sean Mackin described the album:"One for the Kids was a really big album for us. [...] We were just high school kids. When we decided to make a run at being in a band, we signed to a record label, Lobster Records. They had full distribution, and we started recording as a different style of band than when we first started. That was very punk-rock-focused, kind of extra adolescent? When Ryan joined the band, it brought a different kind of songwriting that allowed us to showcase our different sorts of influences. It's an important part of Yellowcard and, really, the version of our band that most people know."[6]

AllMusic stated the album is "full of hooks and catchy choruses as strong as any of the syrupy sweet punk bands around southern California." and compared the sound of the album to Dave Matthews Band. Sputnikmusic praised the band's inclusion of the violin and stated the album was a "rough draft of Ocean Avenue". Exclaim! also praised the band's use of violin, stating "not since FM's Nash the Slash donned bandages has the electric violin been used so effectively in rock music." as well as stating the album had "above average, melodic punk, fusing energy and enthusiasm with creative chord progressions, classically-inspired riffs and harmonies aplenty[19]HM included the song "Something of Value" on the list of essential Yellowcard songs in a retrospective career review.[20]

After working on The Ren & Stimpy Show, many other shows requested the assistance of Rough Draft Korea in animation and ink & paint. In 1992, Rough Draft Studios had produced animation for its first feature film, FernGully: The Last Rainforest. In the same year, the studio began producing animation for The Simpsons and then for Beavis and Butt-Head in 1993. Also in 1993, Gregg's brother Scott Vanzo was brought on board. Rough Draft Korea quickly built a strong portfolio in the animation business with shows like their first series produced outside of South Korea The Maxx in 1995, which was nominated for an Annie Award.[5] Claudia Katz, who had joined Rough Draft Studios in 1994 to produce The Maxx, and Rich Moore, joining in 1995 after having worked with Gregg on The Simpsons, completed the core of a Rough Draft Studios which would help "drive the cartoon boom of the late ‘90s".[6] It was also in 1995 that Rough Draft Studios moved to Glendale, California, where they enjoyed their total success. Rough Draft would then later produce animation for shows like Futurama, Napoleon Dynamite, Sit Down, Shut Up, Drawn Together, Baby Blues, and Disenchantment, while its sister studio in South Korea would also produce animation for shows such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Amphibia, Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, Phineas and Ferb, Rocko's Modern Life, The Angry Beavers, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Family Guy, The Critic, Dilbert, Adventure Time, Sheep in the Big City, Dragon Tales, Gravity Falls, Steven Universe, The Owl House, and King of the Hill. Rough Draft and its divisions would also contribute to feature films based on the shows they worked on such as Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, The Powerpuff Girls Movie, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, The Simpsons Movie, and The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.

Earth 16 - a world where Earth changed little over the course of billions of years. It's volcanically active, radioactive, oxygen-poor and generally inhospitable to living organisms, but it is stated in Final Draft that animal-like voices are sometimes heard from there.
Upon rather bloody returning to our world, Kirill faces troubles with his girl. Hating the system of functionals, she manifests disobedience. But their laws don't forgive this, and the functional Natalie murders her, Kirill being unable to resurrect her...
In Kirill's fighting Natalie, his tower becomes devastated, thus he ceases being a functional and is restored to his former life.
Earth 14 (Janus) - a world with bitterly cold winters and hot summers. Spring is the only season when the weather is anywhere close to tolerable. This version of Earth has no moon and no magnetic field. Although most functionals assume Earth 14 is uninhabited, a functional Kirill encountered in Final Draft insisted that there was some animal and human life that survived by migrating along with the spring weather.
Written in 2005, Moscow,Rough Draftby Sergey Lukyanenko is a science fiction novel of the "parallel world" genre.[1] It was followed by Final Draft.
The story starts with the hero, Kirill, being "erased" from daily life in present-day Moscow. Everybody forgets him (even his parents and dog), another person lives in his apartment, all IDs and files in all offices disappear. After a while he is phoned and invited to an old water tower — but inside is his future home and working place. There it is revealed to him that he is able to open doors, leading to other worlds — although at first all but one are locked. Once opened each door becomes rigidly connected to some world, but which one can't be predicted. All of the worlds have mostly similar environments and seem to be on the planet Earth but the societies and people are different.
After a while Kirill meets a special group of functionals, so called because they gained supernatural abilities making them excellent in some profession. They serve other people, but mostly other functionals. They say Kirill has become one of them — a customs officer. He benefits from taxes paid by people who pass through his tower. Also he has superhuman strength and is almost immortal, but only within 10 km of his tower.

The last door opened leads to the world number One: A lovely Moscow filled with smiling people: there were no horrors of revolution and no World War II, as this world lags for 30 years and the rulers of it carefully study the mistakes of other worlds. It's just what Dima proposed to Kirill, but applied in reverse.
Kirill enjoys these new worlds, people and abilities. A politician Dima meets him and asks to find a national idea for Russia. He informs Kirill about the world number One, which nobody can access and which seems to be exactly our world living 30 years later. Critical information from this world may enhance the prestige of the country.
Earth 17 (Preserve) - a world completely devoid of human life. It's a popular resort among the Functionals and their allies.

Earth 1 (Arkan) - a universe 35 years "behind" Earth 2. It's a home universe of the functionals.
Earth 4 (Antik) - a world that, in many respects, evokes a Greco-Roman utopia. For example, slaves are allowed to rebel twice a year. If they succeed, they can become free citizens and have their own slaves.
Kirill, a Russian living in Moscow, one day discovers that he has the ability to go to other worlds parallel to our Earth.
Kirill also encounters an underground, that is, a few people fighting against the 'corporate laws' of functionals and their working for themselves or the elites of other worlds. He remains untouched by the rhetoric of the underground, justifying most of this. Ideas of armed opposition are alien if not to say ridiculous for him. However, a younger woman whom Kirill falls in love with is a genuine underground activist...
Earth 2 (Demos) - Kirill's home universe. It's the most technologically advanced inhabited universe in the "Fan". Named so for its widespread use of democracy, which is considered to be an archaic form of government in other worlds.
Earth 5 - a world where human beings mate in cycles, coming into heat during the spring. It's more advanced than Earth 3 but less advanced than Earth 2.
Earth 22 (Nirvana) - a universe with no native animal life. The planet's surface is covered with plants that produce a narcotic substance that puts any human being within proximity into a drugged stupor. Functionals use this universe as a political prison for their enemies. The children born in this universe are more resistant to the effects of the plants than their parents, but they aren't completely immune.
Earth 3 (Veroz) - a world where the humanity lives in numerous city-states scattered throughout the planet. Australia is an unexplored continent and the sea is filled with creatures that are regarded as legendary elsewhere (such as the Kraken). Oil doesn't exist on Earth 3, so steam is a primary power source among the natives.
Rough Draft features a number of alternate universes. The precise number of them is unknown, with the later parts of the book suggesting that there may be many more universes than most Functionals are aware of. The only way to travel between these universes is through watchtowers, which exist in several universes at once (though the way they appear differs with each respective universe). The functionals refer to the universes by official numerical designations and more colloquial nicknames. Those nicknames are not always consistent - for example, functions and their allies tend to refer to Earth 3 by the name of a city-state that's closest to the watchtower they use to get there.
Earth 6 (Tverd) - a world dominated by repressive theocracies. The dominant church practices a "warped, lethargic" version of Christianity. This world is known for comparatively advanced bio-technology and ignorance of electricity.

Process of DevelopmentThe process of drafting development usually starts from a young age. At the start when students are taught how to write an essay in classrooms, they are taught the writing steps. It may go with an introduction paragraph, a body paragraph, and a conclusion paragraph. Before a student is guided to start with any of these the drafting process is introduced. Students are taught to write notes before digging into the whole subject itself. For most young students it becomes a habit for most students to use it every single time they write

This image shows the reflection on how drafting/editing has made an impact since a while ago. It has been an incentive that was used prominently years ago. It has helped writers develop better skills with revising and reflection as well. As the image shows corrections all over the page, it directly does help a writer. It helps a writer know where they can improve and see the ways they can do it. When you go back and revise your draft you can catch a lot of easy comments that don't belong to certain places. .mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}

In the context of written composition, "drafting" refers to any process of generating preliminary versions of a written work. Drafting happens at any stage of the writing process as writers generate trial versions of the text they're developing.At the phrasal level, these versions may last less than a second, as writers compose and then delete trial sentences; as fully developed attempts that have reached the end of a stage of usefulness, draft documents may last for perpetuity as saved "versions" or as paper files in archives.Even though it happens at any stage of the writing process it makes a tremendous difference in the way one writes. Writers may get lazy to draft documents and have to keep re-writing, but at the end of the day, it makes a difference since it shows an area of improvement. Writing a paper won't come out perfect the first time, there always needs to be revisions done to fully be prepared when going through the writing process.

How One Could Start Their Own DraftWriter's block could occur when one may not know how to continue writing or how to continue in the writing process itself. First you can start with writing down notes, then start with a brief outline of what you may want to include. As soon as you start this you can begin writing your paper, you can then later revise it as a draft. Your first draft isn't supposed to be perfect, you're supposed to be able to progress your writing with revisions from your draft.In an article by Burtis P.J. There is research being done that connects within the whole process of draft writing. It explores the way that we may even use different types of genres when we write. The development of writing gets split up into different parts. At times when we write for an English course we may write in a specific way, but if we may be writing for a film class another technique may be used. The article expresses how when we write it is generally specifically to the topic that we are focusing on. Generally we might not notice the effects it has, but once you're able to explore in drafts it helps broaden incentives into the way one writes.

How May Draft Writing Help?Draft writing could help in a lot of incentives, more importantly it specifically helps in making a writer strengthen different points. At times we often struggle with the way we may edit our papers. After re reading it we see common mistakes that could have been easily corrected. When draft writing you are able to see the extensive ways one could improve and how far the improvement has gone. Next time you are writing , compare your first draft to your final draft. In doing this you could see the areas of improvement and how the techniques of a writer could change a lot.

Changes of DraftsMany writers may see or not see the change that draft writing takes place. The writing process consists of a lot of techniques, but students are taught to first start with a draft, then follow along with their final draft. The big concept of the writing process is not taken into consideration once writers develop more techniques. The structure when writing an essay and making changes to the whole thing is drafting. Drafting consists of writing multiple papers, with corrections to better your writing and mistakes from the previous piece.Young students are taught this way, according to much research because it helps students make it easier for them to write something. It helps them build up skills to grow into developing more skills. Skills take time to grow, if students start at a young age it can make them a strong writers once their education levels are higher.In a book that became popular in the 1950s, The Elements of Style, Strunk and White characterize a first draft as a less-edited version of the final draft with the purpose of "foresee[ing]...the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape".[1] In Writing Without Teachers, a more recent take on the role of draft documents, Peter Elbow characterizes a draft less as a first attempt at a predetermined final point and more as an attempt at exploring and where a final version might end up.As he puts it, “[w]riting is a way to end up thinking something you couldn’t have started out thinking.”[2] According to Elbow, the best way to accomplish this is a series of drafts which come together to produce an emerging “center of gravity” that then translates into the main focus on the work—a holistic process, in other words, rather than the linear process envisioned by Strunk and White and early writing process theory.Elbow reasoned that if a writer "learns to maximize the interaction" among their "ideas or points of view, [they] can produce new ones that didn’t seem available."[3]
Empirical studies of writers at work indicate that writers can be doing any or all of the following during phases of drafting:
