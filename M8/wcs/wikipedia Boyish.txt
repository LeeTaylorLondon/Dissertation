Boyish can also be an identity on its own to describe someone who feels like they are close to a boy, but not quite. The feminine version is girlish
Boyish is an umbrella term for any sort of male-aligned, man-aligned, boy-aligned, or masculine-aligned gender, and it was made as an easy-to-understand alternative to labels such as mingender, mascgender, and miaspec.

The term was coined by an anonymous Wikia user on February 23rd, 2021.
The blueish-green on the flag represents the way boyish people may be sort of, but not fully, a boy. The purple represents femininity, masculinity, and the mixing of the two, and the white stripe represents the union of all identities that could be considered 'boyish,' just as white is a mixture of all colors.

Transfeminine is a term for any person, binary or non-binary, who was assigned male at birth and has a predominantly feminine gender identity or presentation; transmasculine is the equivalent term for someone who was assigned female at birth and has a predominantly masculine gender identity or presentation.[57]
Non-binary people may identify as an intermediate or separate third gender,[6] identify with more than one gender,[7][8] no gender, or have a fluctuating gender identity.[9] Gender identity is separate from sexual or romantic orientation:[10] non-binary people have various sexual orientations.[11] Being non-binary is also not the same as being intersex; most intersex people identify as either male or female.[12]

In Japan, the expression "X-gender" (x-jendā) has been used since the late 1990s as a definition of gender outside of the binary of male and female.[77] Notable people identifying as X-gender include manga artists Yūki Kamatani and Yuu Watase.[78]

Many flags have been used in non-binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities. There are distinct non-binary and genderqueer pride flags. The genderqueer pride flag was designed in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie. Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary.[105][106][107] The non-binary pride flag was created in 2014 by Kye Rowan.[108] Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary, purple represents those whose gender is a mixture of—or between—male and female, black represents people who have no gender, and white represents those who embrace many or all genders.[109]
A 2020 survey by The Trevor Project found that 26% of LGBTQ youth (ages 13–24) in the U.S. identify as non-binary.[5][131]
Also spelled nonbinary. The term enby, from the abbreviation "NB", is also used.[1]
According to The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 35% of the nearly 28,000 transgender respondents to the anonymous online survey identified as non-binary.[132][133]

The term genderqueer has also been applied by those describing what they see as gender ambiguity.[23][page needed] Androgynous (also androgyne) is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category. This is because the term androgyny is closely associated with a blend of socially defined masculine and feminine traits.[24][page needed] Not all genderqueer people identify as androgynous; some identify as a masculine woman or a feminine man, or combine genderqueer with another gender option.[25] Some people use enby (from the letters NB) as a short form of non-binary.[26][27] Being non-binary is not the same as being intersex, and most intersex people identify as either male or female.[12]

Misgendering, intentional or not, is also a problem that many face. In the case of intentional misgendering, transphobia is a driving force. Additionally, the use of they/them pronouns is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of safe spaces and political correctness,[100] causing pushback and intentional misgendering by some people.[101]

Xenogender is an umbrella term for gender identities that are described with terms outside standard human understandings of gender. These gender identities are typically defined metaphorically in relation to animals, plants, things or sensory characteristics rather than male or female.[59][60]

Demigender people identify partially or mostly with one gender and at the same time with another gender.[50][51] There are several subcategories of the identity. A demi-boy or demi-man, for example, identifies at least partially with being a boy or a man (no matter the sex and gender they were assigned at birth) and partly with other genders or with no other gender (agender). A demiflux person feels that the stable part of their identity is non-binary.[51]

A 2019 survey of the Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ population in Hamilton, Ontario, called Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton showed that 19% of the 906 respondents identified as non-binary.[124]
While the United States does not federally recognize a non-binary gender, in 2016 Oregon became the first state to recognize a non-binary gender identity.[94] In 2017, California passed an act allowing citizens to identify as "non-binary" on official documents.[94] As of 2019, eight states have passed acts that allow "non-binary" or "X" designations on certain identifying documents.[94] One of the main arguments against the inclusion of a third gender identifier in the U.S. is that it would make law enforcement and surveillance harder, but countries that have officially recognized a third gender marker have not reported these issues.[94] In the U.S. there are no explicit laws to protect non-binary people from discrimination, but under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is illegal for an employer to require employees to conform to gender stereotypes,[95] or to fire them merely for being transgender.[96]

"What Does 'Agender' Mean? 6 Things to Know About People With Non-Binary Identities"
In the mid-1990s, the term "gender queer" emerged in connection with the American transgender rights activist Riki Wilchins, who in 2002 co-edited a collection of articles, GenderQueer: Voices from beyond the Sexual Binary.[72] Wilchins used the expression as early as 1995 in the In Your Face newsletter to argue against gender discrimination.[73] In 1997, Wilchins announced they identify as genderqueer in their autobiography.[74] In 2017, they published a collection of articles titled Burn the Binary![75]

In 1781, Jens Andersson of Norway, assigned female at birth but identifying as male, was imprisoned and put on trial after getting married to Anne Kristine Mortensdotter in a Lutheran church. When asked about his gender, the response was "Hand troer at kunde henhøre til begge Deele" ("He believes he belongs to both").[68]

A 2021 survey published in Scientific Reports concluded that 1.19% of Brazilian adults are non-binary, but the study did not ask whether they self-identified as non-binary. Because the authors considered most Brazilians unfamiliar with North American gender terminology, more open-ended questions about gender were asked.[121][122]

Multiple countries legally recognize non-binary or third gender classifications. Some non-Western societies have long recognized transgender people as a third gender, though this may not (or may only recently)[89] include formal legal recognition. In Western societies, Australia may have been the first country to legally recognize a classification of sex outside of "male" and "female" on legal documentation, with the recognition of Alex MacFarlane's intersex status in 2003.[90] The wider legal recognition of non-binary people—following the recognition of intersex people in 2003—in Australian law followed between 2010 and 2014, with legal action taken against the New South Wales Government Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages by transgender activist Norrie May-Welby to recognize Norrie's legal gender identity as "non-specific". India's Supreme Court formally recognized transgender and non-binary people as a distinct third gender in 2014, following legal action taken by transgender activist Laxmi Narayan Tripathi.[91] In July 2021, Argentina incorporated non-binary gender in its national ID card, becoming the first country in South America to legally recognize non-binary gender on all official documentation; non-binary people in the country will have the option to renew their ID with the letter "X" under gender.[92][93]
Bigender (also bi-gender or dual gender) people have two gender identities and behaviors. Identifying as bigender is typically understood to mean that one identifies as both male and female or moves between masculine gender expression and feminine gender expression, having two distinct gender identities simultaneously or fluctuating between them.[40][41][42] This is different from identifying as genderfluid, as those who identify as genderfluid may not go back and forth between any fixed gender identities and may experience an entire range or spectrum of identities over time.[43][44] The American Psychological Association calls bigender identity part of the umbrella of transgender identities.[45] Some bigender people express two distinct personas, which may be feminine, masculine, agender, androgyne, or other gender identities; others find that they identify as two genders simultaneously. A 1999 survey conducted by the San Francisco Department of Public Health observed that, among the transgender community, 3% of those who were assigned male at birth and 8% of those assigned female at birth identified as either "a transvestite, cross-dresser, drag queen, or a bigendered person".[46] A 2016 Harris poll conducted on behalf of GLAAD found that 1% of millennials identify as bigender.[47][48] Trigender people shift among male, female, and third gender.[49]

Genderfluid people often express a desire to remain flexible about their gender identity rather than committing to a single definition.[54] They may fluctuate among differing gender expressions over their lifetime, or express multiple aspects of various gender markers at the same time.[54][55] A genderfluid person may also identify as bigender, trigender, or pangender.[7][8][56]

Many non-binary/genderqueer people use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business, as many institutions and forms of identification—such as passports and driver's licenses—only accept, in the sense of recorded recognition, binary gender identities. But with the increasing acceptance of non-binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as more governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities.[2]

In 1990, the American gender theorist and philosopher Judith Butler published their book Gender Trouble, questioning both the naturalness and the exclusive dichotomy of the male/female binary. Gender Trouble concludes by arguing that expanding cultural understandings of sex and gender contradict the idea of sex and gender as binaries and reveals these binaries as unnatural.[69] Butler has publicly identified as non-binary since 2019.[70][63] They use they/them and she/her pronouns, but prefer the former.[71]

A 2011 survey conducted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in the UK found that 0.4% of the 10,039 respondents identified as non-binary. It does not allow inference about the share of non-binary people in the whole population, since the survey sample was not necessarily representative. The purpose of the survey was to test if respondents are willing to answer questions about their transgender identity.[128] Census data from 2021 indicates that 0.5% of people don't identify with the sex they were assigned with at birth.[129]

Many references use the term transgender to include genderqueer/non-binary people.[13][28][29] This use of the word as a broad term for various kinds of gender variation dates to at least 1992 and the publication of Leslie Feinberg's Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come.[16] In 1994, non-binary author Kate Bornstein wrote, "All the categories of transgender find a common ground in that they each break one or more of the rules of gender: What we have in common is that we are gender outlaws, every one of us."[30] The Human Rights Campaign Foundation and Gender Spectrum use the term gender-expansive to convey "a wider, more flexible range of gender identity and/or expression than typically associated with the binary gender system".[31]
In 1776, the Public Universal Friend identified as a genderless evangelist, and afterward shunned both birth name and gendered pronouns,[65][66] an early instance of an American publicly identifying as non-binary.[67]

People who challenge binary social constructions of gender often self-identify as genderqueer.[21][page needed] In addition an umbrella term for non-binary gender identities, genderqueer has been used as an adjective to refer to people who are perceived to transcend or diverge from traditional distinctions of gender, regardless of their gender identity. People may express gender non-normatively by not conforming into the binary gender categories of "man" and "woman".[22]

The term genderqueer originated in queer zines of the 1980s as a precursor to the term non-binary.[15] It gained wider use in the 1990s among political activists,[16] especially Riki Anne Wilchins.[17] Wilchins used the term in a 1995 essay published in the first issue of In Your Face to describe anyone who is gender nonconforming, and identified as genderqueer in their 1997 autobiography.[18][19] Wilchins was also one of the main contributors to the anthology Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary published in 2002.[20] The internet allowed the term genderqueer to spread even further than zines, and by the 2010s the term was introduced to the mainstream via celebrities who publicly identified under the genderqueer umbrella.[16]

Some non-binary or genderqueer people use gender-neutral pronouns. In English, usage of singular "they", "their" and "them" is the most common;[82][83] nonstandard pronouns—commonly called neopronouns[84]—such as xe, ze, sie, co, and ey are sometimes used as well. Some others use the conventional gender-specific pronouns "he" or "she", alternate between "he" and "she", or use only their name and no pronouns at all.[85] Many use additional neutral language, such as the title Mx.[86][87]

Non-binary[a] and genderqueer are umbrella terms for gender identities that are not solely male or female‍—‌identities that are outside the gender binary.[2][3] Non-binary identities fall under the transgender umbrella, since non-binary people typically identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex,[3] though some non-binary people do not consider themselves transgender.[4][5]
