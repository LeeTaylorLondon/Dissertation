Lost soul - Drifts around a lot more quickly when not charging. When the Demon Rune/berserk pack is used, the player can grab lost souls in midair and throw them. This kills the lost soul upon impact with an explosion. Can also dodge rockets sideways like the cacodemon.
Machine gun - A machine gun that does not use magazines, but it consumes its bullet ammo pool directly. It fires faster than the standard-issue assault rifle but is less accurate with the same amount of damage. It has an under-barrel grenade launcher that can be fired using the secondary fire key, and it must be reloaded every shot. It makes its debut at version 0.21 Beta. A HUD indicator has been added in v21 Gold, which shows if there isn't a grenade in the grenade launcher.

Mancubus - Fireballs leave damaging flames where they explode. Will get knocked down if hit by certain attacks (such as a full super shotgun blast or direct hit from a rocket). It can be angered by using the "offend" feature, which will increase the speed of the fireballs. As of v0.21 beta, it is also able of switching its flame cannons to fire highly damaging bursts of flame when enemy is at close range (akin to the player-usable flame cannon's secondary fire). Also appears in DOOM 1 Episode 3 in form of the Volcabus.
Arch-vile - Mostly unchanged. Has a higher pain chance and lower attack speed. Its sprite now has horns. As of v0.21 beta, can resurrect pain elementals. Also can turn friendly marines into hostile ones.
Railgun - Functions very similarly to its Skulltag counterpart. Though like the plasma gun, it also has a small splash radius - which is very deadly even with armor on. It only fires 5 shots before reloading and uses 10 plasma-balls worth of cells when firing the weapon. Alt-fire uses the scope, same as the rocket launcher, along with the ability to see entities in a way clearly akin to a light amplification visor. It makes its debut at version 0.21. It can pierce thin walls and enemies, and can one-shot cacodemons and Hell knights.
Revenant missile launcher - The missiles lock-on targets. Obtained via the same methods as the mancubus flame cannon, but when used on revenants instead.
The sounds produced during reloading can be a tip-off to the locations and proximity of zombiemen during a level.
MP 40 submachine gun - The Maschinenpistole 40 was used by German paratroopers during World War II, hence it is the weapon dropped by Wolfenstein SS soldiers. It now uses different ammo than the pistol and submachinegun and must be reloaded every 32 rounds. It can be dual-wielded.
2012 Moddb Mod of the Year: Players Choice - 9th place. [2]
Imp - Fireball now travels much faster than before. The imp also comes with a pounce attack, similar to Doom 3's imp.
BFG10000 - More or less similar to its Skulltag counterpart. It makes its debut at version 0.21. It has a lot of recoil.
Super flamethrower - A "proper" flamethrower weapon. It offers drastically increased power and range over the mancubus' version, at the cost of a faster rate of fuel consumption. This flamethrower can also leave more abundant fires around the environment, making it less suited for indoor combat due to the danger it poses to a careless user. As the final weapon added to the mod, the super flamethrower makes its debut at version 0.21 Beta.
Hell knight - Mostly unchanged; similar to the baron of Hell. Sometimes throws three plasma balls in rapid succession. Also can be kicked in the nuts.
Most weapons now use a reload mechanism. Can be enabled or disabled in the options, entirely disabled at the 'Black Metal' difficulty. Auto-reload can also be toggled.
There is also an unofficial patch for v20b that fixes the bug as well as other bugs, it can be found here.
Many enemies have new attacks, such as the imp's pouncing attack. Can be disabled or enabled through options.
Technical aspects›Doom engineRendering engineEngine networking componentBugs & limitationsSource codeRelease versionsFile formatsWAD formatLumpsCommand line argumentsDemos
Unmaker - An Unmaker that is very different from its Doom 64 design, but somewhat similar to Tom Hall's Doom Bible design. It continuously fires a demonic, incendiary laser beam at a high recoil that must be controlled and it expends ammo very quickly too. It uses a different type of ammo that can only be obtained by killing zombiemen, shotgun guys and heavy weapon dudes, it only holds a maximum of 999. It makes its debut at version 0.21 Beta.
Evil Marine - A marine that was converted by an arch-vile into turning against the player. They're much more dangerous than the Wolfenstein SS as they dodge attacks more frequently. They also have an ability to jump and shoot at the player at the same time. They only spawn when an arch-vile 'kills' a captured marine, turning them into an evil marine. They either carry assault rifles or plasma rifles.

Chainsaw - The chainsaw is more or less realistically accurate than its original counterpart, with the ability of actually chopping limbs from monsters. After damaging a monster, blood from the player's hands and the chainsaw will appear, it can only be 'cleaned off' by equipping another weapon. It also seems to be buffed, dealing much more damage and increased range. Primary fire swings the chainsaw horizontally, while Alt-fire swings it overhead of the player.
Spider mastermind - Uses an enhanced version of the minigun firing explosive rounds, which means it has to deal with spin-up time. Players can also walk under the spider mastermind's legs. Notably, this super-minigun is no longer a hitscan attack, but fires (very fast) projectiles. As a result, two spider masterminds can no longer infight with each other, which can make things significantly harder in certain maps (e.g. MAP22: The Escape) where causing such infighting is expected.
Heavy weapon dude - Uses the new minigun, and is subject to the strengths and weaknesses of the minigun.
Mancubus flame cannon - Primary fire acts as fireball shot that ignites enemies upon impact, while secondary fire acts as a burst flamethrower. It can be obtained either by using the chainsaw's or axe's alternate fire on a mancubus corpse or by killing a mancubus with an explosion.
New extra weapons (such as the submachine gun, railgun, grenade launcher, etc.) can be optionally enabled or disabled.
MG 42 machine gun - Also known as Hitler's Buzzsaw, this new weapon alternates with the minigun in weapon slot 4. It likewise has a very high rate of fire but uses a distinct type of ammo of which 600 shots are included at pick-up.
Headshots can be executed on most enemies, with the exception of the spider mastermind, cacodemon, demon, lost soul, and pain elemental.
Zombieman - They either carry an assault rifle or a pistol. Fires its assault rifle in short bursts. Will reload when it finishes the magazine. Sometimes goes into a "last stand" when mortally wounded, drawing a pistol and firing at the player until finished off. As of v0.21 beta, it has new wakeup sounds.
Wolfenstein SS - Replaced with a grey uniform version and its design matches more with the zombieman instead of the original sprite. They have realistically added the ability to dodge attacks as well as attacking while moving at the same time.
Rocket launcher - Has a "revolver style" firing chassis, forcing the player to reload after six shots. The pause between shots is greater, though the damage from the rockets has been increased. Using its secondary attack will let the player use the night vision 4x scope. The cacodemon and the lost soul both have the ability to dodge a rocket.

There are unused monsters inside the mod, originally planned to replace the Skulltag monsters: Juggernaut - A mechanical, tank-like mancubus that fires rockets and can kill the player by rolling over them. Can be summoned from the console and in the 'UAC Testing Center' map. Belphegor - A centaur-like baron of Hell. Can be summoned from the console, they appear to be minibosses in Hell on Earth Starter Pack (now called Extermination Day). Dark Imp - A black imp with blue eyes. Unfinished monster.
Players with berserk can also grab smaller enemies like the zombieman or imp.
Sub-machinegun - The SMG from the Doom cover art is added from the game. And unlike the pistol, it fires at a staggering rate and carries a hefty 40 + 1 rounds inside the magazine at the time, however, it deals damage that is almost the same as the pistol and is it less accurate than the assault rifle, it should be used for close-range combat. But you can aim down the sights for an accuracy increase by pressing the alt-fire key. Along with the pistol, it uses small bullet rounds and can be dual-wielded at the increase of firepower and at the cost of accuracy. It makes its debut at version 0.21 Beta.
Icon of Sin - Unchanged in the base modification. The starter pack and its enhanced MAP30, however, replaces it with a more complex enemy known as the "Real Icon of Sin."
When berserk, players can perform fatalities on enemies. These animations grant temporary invincibility and restore some portion of health, depending on the monster type. Fatalities can be disabled by pressing R while holding fists, and with R can be enabled again. If fatalities are disabled, then monsters will be smashed.
Super shotgun - Deals more damage than before and reloads quicker, though firing will cause a noticeable amount of recoil. Using the secondary attack will shoot just one barrel, which can be useful for taking down smaller enemies. You can switch weapons before needing to reload the super shotgun.
New game modes that can be selected when starting a new game, Standard Mode (Default gameplay and default weapons, either in a pistol start or an assault rifle start), Purist (plays through the Vanilla Doom weapons) and Tactical Mode (Lower speed, but can sprint; otherwise the same as standard mode).
Hand grenades - These are a new weapon that occupies the very last weapon slot and which can be replenished via backpacks and ammo boxes, while single grenades are sometimes dropped by sergeants. They are essentially a throwable rocket launcher blast with a delayed detonation and are quite effective as crowd control weapons.
Some enemies have "overkill" expanded death animations - they can be mutilated by continuing damaging them between when they suffer the killing blow and before their bodies fall to the floor.
Shotgun - The shotgun does more damage than its original counterpart, but compensates for this by only holding nine shells at a time, and utilizes a one-at-a-time manual reloading system. The secondary attack causes the player to look down the sights, granting a limited sniping ability, along with an increased rate of fire due to the use of slam firing technique.

Brutal Doom is compatible with Doom, The Ultimate Doom, Doom II, and Final Doom. It can also be combined with its official, optional starter pack (known as Extermination Day), a set of new levels for Doom II specifically designed to work with the modification.
Brutal Doom (also stylized as Brütal Doom) is a gameplay mod for GZDoom and Zandronum, created by Marcos Abenante (Sergeant Mark IV). Inspired by the Doom comic, the mod has many flourishes, including death animations, elaborate gore effects, and verbal taunts. It also revamps the weapons and monsters. The current version is v21, released in 2019.
To correct this error, open the mod file (brutalv20b.pk3) in software capable of opening .zip files, and extract the file blood.txt. Find the two instances of 0.l (with a lower case letter 'L') and replace them with 0.1 (with a number one). Replace the copy of blood.txt in the .pk3 file with the modified one, and the mod should run normally.
Fists - Players can now deliver punches with both fists independently. Pressing the primary fire button will result in the player giving a quick punch with the right arm. Pressing the secondary fire button will result in a powerful right punch. When the player does a left punch then a right punch consecutively, the next left punch will be an uppercut and have immense power. When the Demon Rune/berserk pack is picked up, hitting the reload button will show the player cracking their knuckles, and a text message will appear. This changes the mode of the fists' effects on enemies. "Smash Mode" delivers immense damage to the opponent, usually gibbing them. "Rip And Tear" make the player perform fatalities on the enemy, from a third-person view. This mode gives a small amount of health with each fatality.
Baron of Hell - Has a new attack where the baron of Hell uses both its hands to charge up, then fires three balls of plasma at the player. It can also pick up barrels and throw them at the player for serious damage, but the barrel can be blown up while the baron of Hell is preparing to throw it. Can also be kicked in the nuts.
All weapons have been re-balanced. For example, the rocket launcher deals much more impact damage but has a lower rate of fire and a smaller blast radius, along with backblast damage that can be toggled off.
Dark Imp - A black imp with blue eyes. Unfinished monster.
2012 Moddb Mod of the Year: MOTY Editors Choice - Creativity Award. [1]
The blur artifact has been replaced with NPC marine allies. These marines start the level tied up, and can be freed with a melee attack or simply via the use key. The latest update reinstated the blur artifact, but they are randomly dropped by spectres instead.
The plasma gun, chainsaw, and BFG9000 use the sound effects of their counterparts from Doom 3.
Assault shotgun - An entirely new weapon added to the mod, a drum-fed automatic shotgun with very slightly less firepower than a pump shotgun per shot with a high rate of fire, but it chews through shotgun shells pretty quickly. It only has 20 shells inside the drum magazine and using its secondary fire mode lets you aim down the sights. It makes its debut at version 0.21 Beta.
Assault rifle - An assault rifle that can be one of the starting weapons, which, unlike the pistol, remains useful even late in the game, with increased accuracy and damage. It has a magazine capacity of 30 + 1 rounds. Using the secondary attack causes the player to look down the sights, making the rifle useful for sniping targets at a considerable distance with complete accuracy. Picking up another assault rifle enables them to be dual-wielded, with a high rate of fire but with poor accuracy. It also disables the player from using grenades. In tactical mode, you can't dual wield the assault rifle.
Pain elemental - Mostly unchanged. Produces some splash damage upon death.
Enemies also have fatality animations if they kill the player (or sometimes, other lesser enemies) with a melee attack.
Many weapons have been replaced, upgraded or added and have secondary fire modes that add various combat functions:
Pistol - The standard pistol remains in the mod and it's one of the starting weapons along with the assault rifle. It deals slightly more damage than its original counterpart and has a dramatic increase in its rate of fire as it is a semi-auto weapon. With alt-fire you can switch to burst fire, firing 3 rounds in rapid succession. It can only hold 15 + 1 rounds and like its Doom 3 counterpart, it no longer uses the same ammo with the assault rifle, minigun or machine gun. But like the assault rifle, submachine gun, and the plasma gun, it can be dual-wielded as long as you find another pistol within the map. While the pistol is formally introduced at version 0.21 Beta, the shotgun guy uses pistol only during their 'last stand'. Zombieman do this too, but they can spawn wielding one, and if they do, they behave much closer to the vanilla counterparts than the ones wielding assault rifles.
Certain enemies, such as the baron of Hell, Hell knight, arachnotron and cyberdemon, have been made larger.
Cacodemon - Can dodge sideways at high speed to avoid rockets, and can even shoot fireballs while dodging. Has a proper melee animation.
Randomly, the player can also be awarded "Cruelty Bonuses": small health recovery in response to particularly brutal kills (often caused by the "overkills").
The player can kick monsters away (Default Key: Q), similar to Duke Nukem 3D. In addition, the player can also slide kick and air kick by crouching and moving forward while kicking, jumping while moving forward while kicking, respectively. Hell knights, barons of Hell and heavy weapon dudes can be kicked in the nuts, causing them to enter a longer pain state, but attack much more aggressively afterwards.
Cyberdemon - Has a new stomp attack, which instantly kills the player and demons. Rockets now have a little spread. Can be angered by using the "offend" feature, which causes the cyberdemon to fire five to six rockets consecutively at a higher fire rate instead of the normal three to four. If killed from a headshot will have a different death sprite whereas it appears to have been decapitated. Now produces an explosion on death, but the player is immune to it.
Plasma gun - More powerful, has a brief pause before firing, and fires slightly slower due to needing to reload fuel cells every 50 shots. Plasma balls have a small splash radius, making firing at point-blank range ill-advised. Secondary attack fires a charged shot, releasing multiple plasma balls as a sort of "plasma shotgun" function. It takes longer to fire a charged shot than to fire as normal and uses 10 shots. Similar to the assault rifle, the plasma gun can be dual-wielded at the expense of accuracy, and during dual-wielding, you can't use the alt-fire.
Grenade launcher - A break-action grenade launcher from its Skulltag counterpart. It only fires one grenade before reloading. Alt-fire fires a grenade that bounces several times before exploding. It makes its debut at version 0.21 Beta. The cacodemon and the lost soul can't dodge the grenade, unlike rockets from the rocket launcher.
Running v20b of Brutal Doom with newer versions of GZDoom (2.3.0 and above) will give the following error:
Spectre - When moving or idle, the spectre will remain completely invisible, save for the eyes. It has a translucent appearance while attacking. If it is severely damaged without dying, it may lose invisibility and continue attacking.
Revenant - Normal and homing rockets differentiated (normal ones are orange, homing ones are red). Crawls around on its upper body and only fires homing rockets if legs are destroyed first. Always "salvo-fires" normal rockets in groups of four after a short wind-up. Has a "fatality attack" if it finishes an imp, shotgun guy or zombieman off with a melee attack: it will grab the monster, smash it around a few times and throw the monster's corpse at the player. If this hits the player, it deals extremely high damage.
Soon after its debut in 2010, Brutal Doom became very popular in the community and won the first ever Cacoward for a mod in 2011. It is among the most influential gameplay mods in Doom history, inspiring a number of other gore-themed mods, including the popular Project Brutality fork.
If you have downloaded an installation of Brutal Doom which includes the starter pack, but wish to play original levels, rename hellonearthstarterpack.wad and copy the original doom2.wad to the folder.
Arachnotron - Mostly unchanged. Also uses the new plasma gun. Also appears in DOOM 1 Episode 3 in form of Ancient arachnotron.
Belphegor - A centaur-like baron of Hell. Can be summoned from the console, they appear to be minibosses in Hell on Earth Starter Pack (now called Extermination Day).
Chaingun - Replaced with a minigun. It fires faster than the chaingun and is more accurate; however, there is a small delay before firing, caused by the spin-up time on the barrels. The secondary attack spins the barrels before attacking. This, of course, removes the delay before firing, and significantly increases the firing rate, at the cost of greatly reduced accuracy, making it very easy to shoot off-target.
Some enemies can be taunted with laughter. They can also be offended by raising a middle finger and shouting, which alerts non-deaf monsters like a weapon would. This causes the cyberdemon in particular to react violently, whereafter it will attack more aggressively.
BFG9000 - Has a somewhat long charge pause before firing, though the attack is more focused and powerful as a result. It also has a significant amount of recoil.
2013 Moddb Mod of the Year: Players Choice - 4th place. [3]
Demon - Largely unchanged. Can survive losing a front limb (the monster goes into a pain state and continues attacking shortly after with increased movement speed). As of v0.21 beta, can perform a lunge attack, countering attempts to bait it into biting and backing off.
Some maps have an Map Enhancement system, modifying maps into their 'brutalized' forms. Can be enabled or disabled in the options.
Shotgun guy - Shotgun fires more pellets (8), but each pellet does less damage (3). Has the ability to roll like the zombieman. It will reload its shotgun when its shells are finished. May also go into a "last stand". As of v0.21 beta, it has new wakeup sounds and has a chance of spawning with an SMG instead.
Juggernaut - A mechanical, tank-like mancubus that fires rockets and can kill the player by rolling over them. Can be summoned from the console and in the 'UAC Testing Center' map.

According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legend's soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.[111]
Schafer, prior to the game's release, stated that Double Fine had "something awesome" planned for downloadable content to further support the game after release.[72] Two downloadable packs have since been released. The first, "Tears of the Hextadon", was released in early November 2009, containing two new multiplayer maps and a new single-player weapon. The pack was initially free on the PlayStation Network for the first two weeks of release.[73] The second pack, "The Hammer of Infinite Fate", was released in mid-December 2009, and in addition to new multiplayer maps, expands the single-player experience by incorporating new weaponry for the Deuce, outfits for Eddie, a GPS system to track collectibles in the game's world, and other additional content, including figureheads of Razputin, the lead character from Psychonauts, and Schafer himself.[74]

A promotional concert for the game was held at the 2009 Comic-Con International Convention in July 2009, and featured the metal artists Gwar, 3 Inches of Blood, Unholy Pink, and Keith Morris.[80]It has also been announced that Brutal Legend was the official sponsor of the 2009 Mastodon/Dethklok tour.[81] Schafer appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on October 2, 2009 to promote the game.[82] Black appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on October 14, 2009, dressed as Eddie Riggs and staying in character during his interview.[83]
In late July, the presiding judge, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan, reported that a preliminary ruling that could have affected the game's release would have been given on August 6, 2009, with Karlan tentatively ready to deny Activision's motion to delay the game.[69] However, prior to the ruling, the companies announced they had reached an out-of-court settlement on the lawsuits, though details were not available.[70][71]

Schafer stated that they began the development with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, they were able to expand out the rest of the game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable.[42] The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.[36]The multiplayer gameplay itself was inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's Herzog Zwei; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat.[32][43] For Brütal Legend, Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in Zwei, the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within Brütal Legend.[32] This subsequently led to much of the action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles.[32] In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.[44]

As of 2013, Schafer is still interested in a sequel to Brütal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources to make it happen as an independent developer.[53] Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, there is a good chance that a sequel to Brütal Legend would be possible.[57] Tim Schafer said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017 that Brütal Legend will eventually get a sequel.
Kyle Gass, Black's collaborator with Tenacious D, voices and lends his facial likeness to a neurotic cannon operator in the game.[6] Comedians David Cross, Steve Agee, Brian Posehn, and actor Wil Wheaton have also provided voice work for the game; Posehn had previously worked with Schafer on their high school newspaper.[33][38][39][40] David Sobolov was also confirmed as a voice actor for other roles in the game; Sobolov noted that he recorded his lines separate from Black's despite his characters' having direct interaction with Riggs.[41] Richard Horvitz, who voiced protagonist Raz in Schafer's previous game, Psychonauts, cameos as the lead guitarist of Kabbage Boy and as a car-lift operator that assigns Eddie certain side missions. Further voice acting work has been provided by veteran video game actors such as Zach Hanks, Kath Soucie, Dino Andrade and Jennifer Hale.[14]
The cancellation of the sequel nearly ruined Double Fine, as they had invested all current efforts toward the title.[32] Instead of a sequel, Double Fine began work on four smaller projects, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade (formerly titled Trenched) and Sesame Street: Once Upon a Monster,[55] based on prototypes they had created from "Amnesia Fortnights" during the development period where they had lacked a publisher. In these two-weeks sessions, the Double Fine team was split into four groups and each tasked with creating a small prototype game to share with the rest of the company; all four mini-games were well received internally. Upon hearing of the cancellation of the sequel, Schafer and his team began to promote these games around, and were able to obtain publishing deals for all four titles.[56] The games will be able to take advantage of the custom game world engine and other assets they had created for Brütal Legend.[54] The titles were considered financial successes, allowing Double Fine to recover and pursue further game development though steering away from major AAA releases.[32]

Within the open world, the player can use a map and the Deuce's turn signals to guide them towards either story-advancing missions or side missions. Side missions include hot-rod races against a demon, defending Eddie's allies from a pending attack, or helping a cannon operator spot his targets. There are about 23 main missions in the story with 30 side missions that the player can optionally take.[4]The player can also explore the game's world to find statues bound in leather or chains that can be freed to gain a health boost for Eddie or to reveal part of the game's backstory, and can look through special telescopes at vistas or complete certain jumps to earn additional Fire Tributes. The player can also find monuments they can raise that unlock an additional heavy metal song from the game's soundtrack that can be played on the Deuce's radio, "The Mouth of Metal"; the player can further customize its set list with songs they have been rewarded with or have collected.[4][7]
While Brütal Legend's fate was unclear, Schafer was not able to talk about the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals, until EA Partners picked up the game in December 2008.[18] However, even when the fate of the publication of the game was unsure, the team continued to work on its development.[47] Schafer reflected that the time spent during development without a publisher was beneficial, allowing them to design the game without pressure from the publisher's goals.[29] EA CEO John Riccitiello, when asked about EA picking up Brütal Legend for distribution prior to December 2008, commented that "Sometimes significant creative risks end up being some of the world’s best products".[48]
"Double Fine Making Four 'Small' Games After Brutal Legend 2 Scrapped"
The game features over 80 unique characters in addition to the main protagonist, Eddie Riggs.[25] Initial designs for Riggs was modeled after Lemmy Kilmister, and though the model was changed, the signature vest, tour pass and cigarette of the character remained part of the character design.[25] As the character continued to develop, they began to add more aspects of Black's character, an "enthusiastic fan" of music, from School of Rock.[21] Ultimately, Riggs' design came to become half Jack Black and half Glenn Danzig.[18] The art team was able to use videos of Black's performances to add additional features to the character, such as "all his crazy eyebrow stuff he does".[21] General Lionwhyte, who has "fabulous hair", and his minions are based on the glam metal fad of the 1980s which displaced heavy metal to the disappointment of Schafer and other development team members, and became the opponents of the game.[26] To help create a more mature game with concepts that could be used to pitch the game, the art team created several factions that represented different parts of the heavy metal experience. Each faction had their own "exaggerated, simplified shapes and strong silhouettes" as to help distinguish each faction while also reducing the development costs.[25] Inspirations for such factions include Nordic imagery, goth metal, and the artwork of Hieronymus Bosch.[25] Additional characters include headbangers, "gravediggers", and "battle nuns".[25] As the game features over two hours of spoken dialog, the art team wants to make the characters' faces and performances stand out, creating "clean, easy-to-read faces". The team had to change from their initial cartoony textures into more detailed ones that stood out on high-definition displays while exaggerating other features of the characters.[25]
Brütal Legend follows the story of Eddie Riggs (voiced by Jack Black), who is "the world's best roadie" for "the world's worst 'heavy metal' band", Kabbage Boy.[4][13] Much of the game takes place in an unnamed world inspired by heavy metal music, created by, according to the game's mythology, Ormagöden, The Eternal Firebeast, Cremator of the Sky, and Destroyer of the Ancient World.[4] In this alternate world, the human race is enslaved by a race of demons, led by Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil, (voiced by Tim Curry). Doviculus is assisted by his glam metal human minion, General Lionwhyte (voiced by Rob Halford and based on David Bowie with the name being an allusion to glammetal band White Lion) whose hair is so big "and luscious" that he uses it to fly, flapping it like a pair of broad wings.[14] Leading the fight against Doviculus are a small band of human resistance fighters with whom Eddie joins forces: Lars Halford (voiced by Zach Hanks), his sister Lita (voiced by Kath Soucie), and Ophelia (voiced by Jennifer Hale), whom Eddie takes a romantic interest in. Their group is later joined by the stage manager and tour bus driver Mangus (Alex Fernandez), the bass-playing healer Kill Master (voiced by, and patterned after Lemmy Kilmister),[15] the motorcycle-riding Fire Baron (also voiced by Halford, as well as visually inspired by him too),[14] and the Amazonian Rima (voiced by Lita Ford and based on KISS characters).[14] Also supporting Eddie is the Guardian of Metal (voiced by Ozzy Osbourne, who also lent his appearance to the character) that assists in upgrading his equipment.[15]

Several main story missions of the game are Stage Battles based on real time strategy elements. The player, while still in control of Eddie, is required to defend a giant stage where new allies will spawn, holding out until a specific objective is completed. The player creates an army for attacks by building merchandise booths on "fan geysers" through Clementine's magic. Once enough fans are collected, the player can summon different allies, each consuming a specific number of fans, or upgrade their stage to allow them to produce more powerful allies. A character known as Mangus acts as the "sound guy" to help in the construction of these units and stage upgrades, and also warns the player of enemy attacks.[5] Once the player has gathered their army, they can then seek out and attack their opponents.[8] Eddie is able to control the entire army to follow, attack, or defend a point, and can use specialized squads of specific units to perform certain tasks, such as having a group of headbangers use their headbanging to destroy statues.[4] The player can also use Eddie directly in combat during these battles. Ultimately, Eddie transforms into a winged demon who can fly above the battlefields to issue orders or lay out attacks.[5] Spells in Eddie's arsenal can help control the performance of his armies, such as temporarily boosting their attack skills or creating a rally flag which troops will gather at, while others hinder the performance of the enemy faction by removing enemy buffs or preventing the creation of enemy units for a short time. Each of the different units, including special allies that Eddie meets in the game, has a special co-op move they can perform with Eddie; for example, Eddie's first ally, Ophelia, can be tossed at foes by Eddie in the style of the Fastball Special. These co-op moves are also available outside of Stage Battle missions.[4]

With the popularity of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, many wondered if Brütal Legend would take advantage of these games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly switch between standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it.[45] Players who preordered the game through GameStop were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by both Black and Kyle Gass.[46]

Brütal Legend was announced in October 2007 through a feature article in Game Informer;[19] gaming journalists had received a vinyl record from Activision that contained a backwards message alluding to the game's story.[75] The game's release in October 2009 was promoted as "Rocktober" in official literature about the game from Electronic Arts.[76] At the 2009 Download Festival in Donington Park in England, Electronic Arts arranged for 440 fans of Brütal Legend to help to break the Guinness World Record for the largest number of air guitar players, all simultaneously playing to "Ace of Spades" by Motörhead.[77] A series of short online videos featuring Black (and Schafer in two instances), entitled "Brutal Thoughts with Jack Black", have been used to promote the game since May 2009.[78] At the 2009 Video Music Awards, Black appeared in cosplay as Eddie to promote the game.[79]

The heavy metal-inspired world of Brütal Legend was also well received, and considered to show a clear reverence for the genre.Gerald Villoria of GameSpy considered the game to be "dedicated to an unabashed love of metal" and "heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree".[100] Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements that made up the heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being "both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass" at the same time.[101] Critics found that while the graphics for the game may not be the most sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that "no matter where you are in the world, there's always some cool object to look at",[99] while Donlan considered the world to be a "constant unfolding delight".[97] The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's "Through the Fire and Flames" would be used as background music during specific game sequences.[96][100] Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music.[96] Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have "enormous breadth of sound and diversity", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they may not have known even existed.[100] G4TV's Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of "taking a class in heavy metal appreciation."[103]

Schafer had tried to get music from groups like Metallica and AC/DC, but their licensing fees were too high.[32] He further tried to work with Iron Maiden, but the group was hesitant to participate after recognizing that the character name "Eddie Riggs" suggested an attachment with the band's mascot, named "Eddie" and designed by Derek Riggs; the band's marketing group pointed out that this could imply that Iron Maiden had endorsed the game.[32]

"But I thought, if we were to make a fantasy game it would be cool to out-fantasy the fantasy games and go even farther. And what would be the name of something like that? And that's where the name Brütal Legend came from, because it just sounded like the hardest core fantasy thing out there."
Schafer has pointed out that there are music term inspired attacks, such as a "Face-Melting" guitar solo, which literally will melt the foe's faces off.[24] The metal/motorcyclist lifestyles and Norse mythology also inspired the game's open-world environments, such as amps carved into the face of a mountain, a forest where tires replace leaves, giant axes and swords piercing the ground, spandex covered temples, and mining facilities where human slaves excavated car and motorcycle parts. However, Schafer noted that they attempted to make sure that non-metal fans would be able to get the jokes as well.[18]

During a gig for Kabbage Boy, Eddie is crushed by falling scenery while trying to save a member of the band; his blood lands on his belt buckle, in reality an amulet for Ormagöden. The stage is transformed into Ormagöden, who kills the band and takes the unconscious Eddie to the heavy metal world. Awaking in the Temple of Ormagöden, Eddie meets with Ophelia while fighting Doviculus' forces, developing a crush on her. They discover writings left by the Titans that Eddie is able to comprehend, and build a hot-rod, the "Deuce", that they use to escape the Temple (confronting a giant lamprey-like monster) and travel to Bladehenge, the base for the small human resistance force led by Lars and Lita. When they meet Eddie and learn he can understand the Titans' messages, they see him as a prophetical "Chosen One", though a 'dispute about the translation' leaves them unsure if he will be the savior or destroyer of the world.[6][16] Ophelia also becomes concerned when Eddie, in the heat of battle, transforms into a winged creature, an effect Eddie decides to use to his advantage at the time.

Though most of the developers involved in the game were shielded from the effects of the lawsuit, Double Fine's Caroline Esmurdoc noted that it took a significant toll on Schafer and the other lead executives at the company.[33] Activision's lawsuit had been filed at the time the game had reached the alpha release state, and would need to be concluded prior to the game's final release; this required the executives to dedicate their time towards information gathering, interviewing, and other legal matters "during the crunchiest, most critical time of development".[33] As such, while they ultimately were able to settle the legal matter, Esmurdoc believed that the impact of the effort in settling the lawsuit impacted the quality of the final product.[33] Schafer wrote more than 50% of the game's dialog in the few months following the completion of the lawsuit and prior to release, a "big crunch" for him.[29]
Brütal Legend was generally well received by game reviewers, praising Schafer's vision and writing of the heavy metal-inspired world, and the performances of the voice cast, particularly Black and Osbourne. Some felt that the hybrid gameplay of action and real-time strategy games did not mix well, however, blaming console control limitations and missing features normally found in games of either genre.
Part of the game's inspiration came from the fantasy worlds that the lyrics and album covers of metal bands implied but rarely made it to music videos, thus allowing Brütal Legend to "fulfill the promise" of such lore.[18] Schafer also credits a Megadeth roadie named Tony he once met as having given him the idea to make a game about a roadie, with the character of Eddie Riggs becoming a re-imagined version of him.[20] Schafer had previously explored the idea of a roadie sent back in time with the character of Hoagie from Day of the Tentacle, but Brütal Legend represented an opportunity to expand on it further.[21] The 2003 movie School of Rock also reminded Schafer of his idea for Brütal Legend, and made him more excited to publish it.[22]Double Fine's philosophy on game development was also another reason for Brütal Legend's creation, as Schafer has stated that his team attempts to make each game radically different from the company's previous release, contrasting Brütal Legend to Psychonauts.[23] Schafer stated that the commercial tie-ins of Brütal Legend, such as "hot babes and Jack Black", is due to this philosophy and not due to market pressures. Schafer was not concerned about the commercial success of Brütal Legend, as despite poor sales of Psychonauts, "as long as you make a cool game, publishers want to talk to you".[23] When Schafer was pitching the game before 2006, he received feedback about changing the game's style to hip hop or country. He credits Harmonix Music Systems for influencing the rhythm game market through the release of the widely successful Guitar Hero with a soundtrack that heavily emphasized metal music; with the popularity of Guitar Hero, the metal approach in Brütal Legend was readily accepted.[18]

Brütal Legend is a third person action-adventure game incorporating real time strategy elements.[4] The game uses an open world that Tim Schafer has described as being approximately 40 square miles (100 km2) in area.[4] The player controls the protagonist Eddie Riggs, a roadie who one day finds himself transported into a heavy metal-themed fantasy world. Eddie acquires three tools that are used for combat and transportation: a broad axe called "The Separator", his Flying V guitar "Clementine" from his own world which has the ability to cast magic spells in the heavy metal world, and a hot rod that Eddie builds called "The Druid Plow", a.k.a. "The Deuce".[4] Spells, referred to as "Solos", from Clementine are performed by playing a minigame akin to the note-matching aspect of Guitar Hero or Rock Band over a brief guitar riff; however, Eddie cannot use the metal generated by Clementine constantly, as prolonged usage of the guitar will cause it to overheat, and the player will have to wait for a cool-off period before using the guitar's power again.[5] Eddie may also find more solos hidden throughout the world, ranging from support to offensive spells. The player can spend in-game currency called "Fire Tributes", earned from completing missions, at the Motor Forge to gain new abilities and upgrades for each tool.[6] These tools can be used in combination with each other to take out Eddie's foes; for example, the player can use his guitar Clementine to create pyrotechnics to launch a foe into the air and follow up by attack it with the Separator axe. In a case of a specific boss fight, the player must use the Deuce hot rod to lure the boss to a spiked gate held up by counterweights, and then play the "Earthshaker" move on Clementine to destroy the weights and sever the creature's head.[4]

Gameplay outside of the Stage Battles was also met with mixed impressions. Most considered the side missions highly repetitive,[96][99][100][103] which included mission types that are generally disliked by gamers, such as escort missions.[99][100]The lack of a mini-map, replaced by either following a glowing light from the sky illuminating the player's target or by navigating based on the Deuce's turn signals, was criticized for making it difficult to explore the game's world.[95][100] The information about the world that players can access in the game's pause menu was also found to be lacking, neither showing the collectible elements of the game on the main map, nor easily identifying the alliance of the various troops in the in-game guidebook.[95]Though Eddie gains the ability to fly during Stage Battles, the inability to use this or to make the character jump led to reviewers getting the character stuck on the landscape at times when exploring.[95] Some reviewers found the number of progress checkpoints in the game to be lacking, requiring the player to repeat a long mission if they should die before reaching one.[96][100] The single-player game was also considered to be short, lasting as little as four hours if one only completed the main story missions.[97][101] In 2011, readers of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition voted Eddie Riggs as the 48th-top video game character of all time.[106]
A demo version of the game was made available on the Xbox 360 Marketplace and PlayStation Network Store; it was available for a limited time on September 17, 2009 for North American users who had pre-ordered the product through GameStop. The demo became available to all Xbox Live Gold users on September 24, 2009, and to Xbox Live Silver users and all PlayStation 3 users the following week.[84][85] The demo is based on the game's beginning, showing Eddie's arrival and his encounters up until the first boss character fight.[42]

The game, a hybrid of the action-adventure and real-time strategy genres, includes Stage Battles in both the single-player and multiplayer mode, where the player must command troops to defeat their foes while defending their own stage. In addition to Black, the game features voices of heavy metal musicians including Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne and Lita Ford and other celebrities such as Tim Curry, as well as more than one hundred metal songs selected by Schafer for inclusion in the game.

The team used Unreal Engine 2.5 to build and test prototypes of the real-time strategy elements, allowing the designers and gameplay programmers to commence work while another team focused on creating a new game engine.[33] Having completed the multiplayer stage battle portion of the game first, Double Fine found it easy to gradually introduce the player to its more advanced aspects during the single-player campaign.[42] The game-world's large size and varied content necessitated a game engine with streaming capabilities, allowing the game to seamlessly load and unload content as needed — this was also something the team had no prior experience with.[36] Double Fine developed several in-house tools to help streamline the content-creation process for the game's world: an automated testing bot, RoBert (so named after one of the test engineers), was created to put daily builds of the game through continuous and rigorous testing, automatically reporting any errors to developers, while the Multi-User-Editor allowed the game's artists to simultaneously work on the game-world without fear of overwriting each other's work.[33] The team ran into content management issues late in the game's development as more of the game's assets neared completion. Within the span of a few months the combined asset size tripled, endangering the game's ability to fit on a DVD and causing performance problems throughout the company's development systems. With the help of the engineering team, they were eventually able to overcome the performance issues and re-optimize the content for space.[33]

When rumors of a possible Wii port arose in March 2009, Schafer stated that "We are making an Xbox 360 and a PS3 version of Brütal Legend."[49] However, according to Ben Fritz at Variety, another studio has been engaged by Electronic Arts to bring the game to the Wii, albeit at a later date than the other console versions, suggesting that it may follow the same model as Dead Space: Extraction, a Wii title scheduled to be released about a year after Dead Space's first release.[50] However, further industry rumors, which claimed that the Wii version was being done by Electronic Arts in-house, have stated that the effort to port the game to the Wii has been canceled due to quality and technical concerns.[51]

The actual gameplay was seen as Brütal Legend's largest weakness. Many reviewers were critical of the incorporation of real-time strategy (RTS) elements into the game, a fact that was not well advertised prior to the game's release and does not become apparent to the player in the first hours of the game.[97][104] Though Schafer had set out to make the console-based game like an RTS from the start,[43] they were warned by both Vivendi and Electronic Arts that "RTS" was "a naughty word in the console space", and instead marketed it as an action game.[33] Despite this, reviewers found that the game was still difficult to play on a console due to the selected controls that made it difficult to target objectives or troops, the lack of a mini-map to track friends and foes, and the frantic pace of battle.[95][99][100]

Double Fine believed they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and had invested a great deal of development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled.[54] Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained.[29] The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus.[32] Schafer further noted that at the end of the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus.[32] Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.[29]

Though Ronnie James Dio of the band Dio had performed parts for the game, his role was replaced with voice work from Tim Curry.[34] While the change was speculated to be due to tense issues between Osbourne and Dio, Schafer noted that as Dio's intended character, "Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil", grew, they found that Curry fit the role better for the part, citing Curry's role of the Lord of Darkness in the film Legend as a key factor;[35] Schafer would also later state that Dio's part was cut due to a combination of "really complicated reasons" and other circumstances outside their control.[32] Curry considered the role "perfect" for him when Schafer described Doviculus to him as "big and tough, but also has this kinky side who, when hit with an ax, might scream in pain or squeal with delight".[15]

The user interface and menus were created by Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series.[27] Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.[28]
According to Schafer, Brütal Legend had been in development since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts.[18] Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but were not able to successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone.[33] For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.[33]

Brütal Legend was originally to be published by Vivendi Games' subsidiary Sierra Entertainment. In 2008, Activision merged with Vivendi's game division (which included Blizzard Entertainment) to become Activision Blizzard, gaining the rights to publication of Brütal Legend.Upon evaluation of their assets, Activision Blizzard chose to drop Brütal Legend along with several other games, leaving the project in limbo.[58] Activision CEO Robert Kotick later claimed the reason for dropping the project was due to: the project running late; missing milestones; overspending the budget and not looking like a good game.[59] Double Fine themselves were unaware that Activision had chosen to drop the game, having been informed through an Activision press release that omitted the game from their upcoming release schedule, according to studio producer Caroline Esmurdoc.[60] Industry rumors suggested that Electronic Arts was interested in publishing the property,[61] and it was confirmed in December 2008 that Electronic Arts would publish the game.[62] During the period when Brütal Legend's fate was unclear, Schafer was not able to talk about the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals.[18]

"Brutal Legend Sequel Could Happen if Psychonauts 2 Does Well"
Brütal Legend received positive response from gaming journalists, with reviewers praising the story and characters of the game, and driven vocal performances of the voice actors, particularly Black and Osbourne. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt Black was "completely committed" to the role of Riggs,[102] while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis found it relieving that Black reined in his typical "loud-talking heavy-metal goofball" act that he is known for and instead performed well, "bringing just the right amount of working-man's matter-of-fact-ness to the role".[101] Osbourne's role was considered "amazing (and surprisingly coherent)" by GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini and "played brilliantly" by Computer and Video Games' Andrew Kelly.[96] The full cast was commended for their roles; the heavy metal musicians were effective at playing themselves in the game, while the other voice talent performed well and "[did] their part to balance out the star power" in the game.[99] The strength of the characters was considered to be enhanced by the quality of writing of the story, and the use of facial animation.[96][100][102] Eurogamer's Christian Donlan considered the characters of Brütal Legend to be the strongest aspect to the game, distancing the title from other video games due to "rounded, personable leads who are distinctly superior to the usual throngs of cybermen and super-vixens", and a facet of Schafer's signature work.[97] Wired's Chris Kohler further attested the strength of the game's story to Schafer's skill, considering that "After Brütal Legend, he should be considered one of the best storytellers in gaming, period."[104] 1UP.com's Justin Haywald noted that the game lacks the ability to review cutscenes, forcing the player to restart the story if they wanted to see these again.[95]
"Brutal Legend 'Hammer of Infinite Fate' DLC Announced, Brings Giant Stone Schafer and Razputin"
According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold approximately 215,000 copies in the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, making it the 12th-top-selling game in that month.[107][108] These numbers were not considered to be strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game.[109] In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies.[110]

In addition to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long-term collaborator Peter McConnell.[87] McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band to tie in with the licensed music in the game.[21] Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other "real" drums (6 tracks) were played by Y&T drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum.[88][89] The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos).[33] While Schafer would like to have a soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was not sure if it would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack.[7] Schafer helped to select three songs—"We Are The Road Crew" by Motörhead, "The Metal" by Tenacious D, and "More Than Meets The Eye" by Testament—to appear in a pack of Rock Band downloadable songs that was made available the same day as Brütal Legend's release.[90]

Initially after its release, Double Fine had not planned on a PC version of the game, as Schafer has stated that the game is primarily an action game and "meant to be on a console".[7] However, in February 2013, Double Fine announced that a Windows version of the game will be released on February 26, 2013. The Windows port has been updated for higher resolutions of modern computers, and includes both DLC packs released for consoles.[52] The multiplayer aspects of the PC version include a number of tweaks that Double Fine had tracked that they wanted to have made to the console version but could not do; while the full list of changes are not expected to be present in the initial PC release, Schafer has stated that if sales of the PC version are successful, they will look at adding new units, factions, and gameplay modes that they had originally scoped out for the console version.[53] Mac and Linux ports were released in May 2013, premiering as part of the Humble Double Fine Bundle.

In July 2009, Double Fine issued a countersuit against Activision, citing that the latter company had abandoned the project before, and was trying to harm Brütal Legend during its critical marketing phase, as well as trying to protect its Guitar Hero franchise.[66] The countersuit stated that Activision had dropped the game after its merger with Vivendi and a failed attempt to convert the game into a Guitar Hero sequel.[67] Schafer was infamously quoted as saying, in commenting on their actions, "Hey, if Activision liked it, then they should have put a ring on it. Oh great, now Beyonce is going to sue me too."[68]

In February 2009, Activision Blizzard had asserted that the Electronic Arts deal was invalid, believing that they were still in negotiations with Double Fine to publish the game. It was believed that Activision was seeking monetary compensation in a similar manner as it received from Atari for Ghostbusters: The Video Game and The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena, games that were dropped when Activision Blizzard re-evaluated their assets.[63] On June 4, 2009, Activision filed suit to prevent publishing of the game, claiming that they had invested $15 million in the title and still had a valid contract to release the game.[64] Activision's suit also contends that Double Fine had missed a deadline for the game last year, requesting more time and an additional $7 million in development fees. Activision's considers both the loss of the money they spent on the game as well as potential sales and Brütal Legend-related merchandise as part of the harm done in the lawsuit.[65]

With their new allies, Ironheade manages to push the Drowning Doom back towards the Sea of Black Tears; defeated, Ophelia denies Eddie's belief that she is Doviculus' spy, again claiming that Eddie's the traitor. As they argue, Doviculus arrives and confirms that Succoria is not Ophelia, but Eddie's mother. In the past, Succoria, an even more vicious demon empress, also sought the Titans' secrets in the future. However, after discovering that humans eventually become the dominant species, Succoria fell into a deep despair. Riggnarok, who had followed Succoria through time to assassinate her, took pity on her in her misery, and the two fell in love and bore Eddie. Now in the past, Eddie's demon nature has borne out, and has also inadvertently revealed the Titans' secrets to Doviculus as well. Having no more use for Ophelia, Doviculus rips out her heart, taking her powers alongside his own and causing Ophelia to dissipate. While Ironheade battles Doviculus' forces headed by a massive monster made from the Sea, Eddie engages Doviculus in a one-on-one confrontation, which ends with the demon emperor's decapitation. As Eddie escapes the Sea, he recovers Ophelia's heart from Doviculus, containing his mother's necklace he gave her when they first met, and then proceeds to rescue the real Ophelia from the ocean floor. Ashore, they rekindle their love as Ironheade celebrates their victory over Doviculus and the Tainted Coil. Back at Bladehenge, a statue to Lars is erected, while Lita continues to lead the troops against the remaining demons. Eddie insists on maintaining his "roadie" presence, staying behind the scenes and making others look good. After he promises he is not leaving to his assembled friends, Eddie takes off to complete a few errands, with Ophelia watching as he drives off into the sunset, shedding a single black tear.

The game has a multiplayer mode, described by Schafer as "your typical head-to-head, battle of the bands scenario. But with axes."[4] The multiplayer modes are team-based and play in the same manner as the single-player Stage Battles, with team sizes from one-versus-one to four-versus-four.[7][9] Each team selects from one of three factions which affect what resources and troops they can summon, and are tasked with defending their stage from attack by the other team. The three factions available are Ironheade, mostly human-based troops visually inspired by classic Heavy Metal led by Eddie Riggs; The Drowning Doom, with more Goth/Black Metal undead led by Drowned Ophelia; and The Tainted Coil, evil Industrial Metal BDSM/religion-themed demons controlled by Doviculus.[10] Each player controls a single main avatar who has the same abilities as in the main game for combat and magic spells and can also fly about the map, but also is in control of troops that they may summon from the team's shared resources—fans as generated by fan geysers across the map.[11] Different types of troops are available, costing various numbers of fans to summon, with the potential to upgrade to improved units through different routes. The number and types of troops that can be summoned is limited by a cap to prevent either team from becoming too overpowered. All of the troops can be engaged by the player to initiate various "Double Team" moves as with the single player game. The game can also be played by a single player with computer-controller opponents at one of five difficulty levels.[12]

Brütal Legend features 107 heavy metal tracks from 75 different bands, selected by Schafer and Music Director Emily Ridgway,[86] each song being a "completely sincere choice" by Schafer and Ridgway,[20] with the whole track list being "designed to be loved by Metal fans."[86] Schafer sought to include songs from most main subgenres of metal, including classic heavy metal, industrial metal, black metal, and doom metal, with each faction in the game favoring a specific type.[7] Though Schafer and others on the Double Fine team had vast knowledge of specific types of metal, Ridgway turned to a used-CD store owner named Allan from Aquarius Records who had "encyclopedic knowledge" of the entire genre, and who provided the team with sample CDs to help them discover some of the more obscure metal bands.[21] Schafer had identified many of the more well-known songs on the list, while Ridgway was able to locate mission-appropriate, more obscure titles for inclusion; for example, one mission, given by the Killmaster (voiced by Lemmy Kilmister), involves rescuing female troops for Ironheade's army; Ridgway had been able to locate a cover of "Bomber", originally recorded by Motörhead (Kilmister's band) and performed by the all-female metal band Girlschool, recorded in their 1981 split EP St. Valentine's Day Massacre.[32] Schafer also credits Black with some of the music selections for the game.[21] Instead of relying on labels or bands to provide them with a list of possible songs to select from, the development team sought permission to use specific songs they wanted in the game. In some cases, obtaining appropriate licensing proved difficult, as for songs from bands that had long split up, Double Fine needed to contact each band member to gain permission. This proved to be valuable, as some original bands were excited about their music being used in the game; in one case, Lita Ford was able to provide the game with a song with slight modifications to the lyrics from a version that she was about to release.[42] One song is from the in-game band "Kabbage Boy" for which Eddie is a roadie at the start of the game.[13]
"Double Fine Humble Bundle brings Brutal Legend, Costume Quest and more to Windows, Mac and Linux"
Brütal Legend is an action-adventure video game with real-time strategy game elements created by Double Fine and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game was released during October 2009 in North America, Europe, and Australia. Though Brütal Legend was originally to be published by Vivendi Games prior to its merger with Activision, Activision dropped the game from its portfolio after the merger. It was later picked up by Electronic Arts, though Activision and Double Fine brought counter-lawsuits against each other over publishing issues. The issues were settled out of court. Later, Double Fine announced a port of the game for Microsoft Windows via Steam, which was released in February 2013. Mac OS X and Linux versions of the game were made available as part of the Humble Bundle in May 2013. A physical collector's edition for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux was released by IndieBox in October 2014.

Similar to their experience with bringing Black onto the project, obtaining the voicework of the metal artists were also unexpected but beneficial.[7] This led to some confusion during voice recording sessions; both Lita Ford and Rob Halford had difficulties with lines involving a character named "Lita Halford".[7] Furthermore, both Black and Osbourne frequently injected profanity into their scripted lines during recording sessions. Instead of rerecording these, the development left these in the game, but included the option for a profanity content filter to be enabled by the player to "bleep" out these words and mask such word on screen using the Parents Music Resource Center "Parental Advisory" label, an icon that Schafer considered to be part of the history of heavy metal.A similar filter exists for gore in the game, preventing any dismemberment and disabling blood in the game. Schafer stated the filters were added to the game in consideration of older players that may not wish to see such aspects, or for parents who opt to play the game with younger children.[36] During development, Schafer stated that while he could not confirm what other musicians and bands would be in the game, there would be more than already stated, and that these musicians were "especially conducive to character creation" due to the amount of theatrics used in their concert shows.[37]

Brütal Legend includes over 35,000 lines of spoken dialog, mostly written by Schafer.[29] In addition to Black, Lemmy, Judas Priest's Rob Halford, The Runaways' Lita Ford, and Ozzy Osbourne provide character voices for these lines.[30][31]
Tim Schafer, the game's creative director, was inspired to create the game by his own past musical experiences. The game features the character of Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled after Jack Black, a roadie who is transported to a fantasy world inspired by the artwork of heavy metal album covers. Eddie becomes the world's savior, leading the down-trodden humans against a range of supernatural overlords using a battle axe, his Flying V guitar that can tap into the magical powers of the world, and a customizable hot rod.

Schafer's original vision for the game had not anticipated a celebrity cast.[32] In particular, though Eddie came to resemble Black, the team had not planned on having Jack Black voice the character. After learning that Black was a fan of Schafer's previous game, Psychonauts, they met with the actor/musician and recognized he was an avid gamer and metal fan and understood all the choices the team made in the game, and subsequently signed on for the voice work.[18] Black also performed live-action sequences as himself used for the in-game menu screens and additional promotional material.[33] Once Black had signed up for the project, Schafer found that other artists and people involved in the heavy metal scene became very interested in participating through a domino effect and word of mouth, allowing Schafer to sign them on as voice talent or as part of the game's soundtrack.[32]

Eddie helps Lars, Lita, and Ophelia create an army, named "Ironheade" to fight against General Lionwhyte.[4] They successfully raid Lionwhyte's "Pleasure Tower" and defeat him. However, as they celebrate, Doviculus arrives, sending the group into hiding. Doviculus is aware of the presence of his spy "Succoria" by the smell of her blood as it was at the Temple; Eddie and his allies come to believe Ophelia is Doviculus' spy. Lars leaves his hiding spot to face Doviculus, but is quickly killed. As the Tainted Coil destroy the tower, Ironheade escapes into the nearby mountains; Eddie is forced to leave with Lita leaving Ophelia behind despite their shared love. Heartbroken, Ophelia is drawn toward the Sea of Black Tears, cursed waters that grant humans supernatural abilities at the cost of humanity. After leaping into the black waters, the Sea creates Drowned Ophelia, a dark doppelganger of Ophelia, who raises an army of other Black Tear-corrupted humans, the goth "Drowning Doom". After three months, she leads an attack on Ironheade's mountain camp. Though Ironheade defeats the assault, Eddie determines they must destroy the Sea to end her threat. As they travel through exotic lands and find more allies out of the pyromanical Fire Barons and the amazonian Zaulia tribe, they come across evidence of Eddie's father, the hero known as Riggnarok in this time. It tells that Riggnarok traveled to the future to attempt to learn the secrets of the Titans to bring back to the past in the humans' ongoing fight against the demons, but never returned.

Players in Doom: The Boardgame are on one of two teams: the Invaders, and the Marines. All of the Invader pieces are controlled by one player, and the rest of the players each control one marine piece.[2] Before each game begins, the players must choose a scenario to play in. A campaign consisting of five scenarios is included with the game, and many more have been created using freeware scenario editors. The player controlling the Invaders must get six frags to win,[3] whereas the Marines must reach the exit to win. A "frag" is given to the Invaders if a Marine dies. When a Marine dies, it must respawn between eight to sixteen spaces from where it was killed. A common opinion is that the game is biased in favor of the Invaders - especially with four players.[citation needed] The designer of the game, Kevin Wilson, claims that he can win equally well no matter which team he is playing. Like many board games, it is common to develop house rules (called "mods" to fit the video game theme) to balance the game to players' liking.
Doom: The Board Game and Doom: The Board Game Expansion Setat BoardGameGeek
An expansion was released for the game in 2005, called Doom: The Boardgame Expansion Set, which adds difficulty levels to the game, new game pieces and updates to some of the original rules, as well rules to play on Deathmatch and Capture the Flag.
An updated version was released by Fantasy Flight in 2016, resembling the newly released DOOM.[1]

Doom: The Boardgame is an adventure board game for two to four players (two to five in the 2016 edition) designed by Kevin Wilson and published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2004. The game is based on the Doom series of first-person shooter computer games, though it resembles Doom 3 more than it does the first two Doom video games.

The facility is overrun by demons after one of Hayden's researchers, Olivia Pierce, makes a pact with them and plots to use the Tower to open a portal to Hell.[28] In desperation, Hayden releases the Doom Slayer from his sarcophagus to repel the demonic invasion and close the portal. The Doom Slayer recovers his Praetor Suit and fights his way through the overrun facility, guided by the self-aware AI VEGA, which controls the facility. After clearing out the facility core and preventing a meltdown, he pursues Pierce and destroys the energy induction filters, despite Hayden's objections. He tracks Pierce up the tower, where she uses an Argent accumulator to open an explosive rift into Hell, destroying the Tower and sending the Slayer back to Hell.

In April 2009, Hollenshead said that Doom 4 was "deep in development". Asked whether Doom 4 would be a sequel, a reboot, or a prequel, his response was "It's not a sequel to Doom 3, but it's not a reboot either. Doom 3 was sort of a reboot. It's a little bit different than those."[37] On June 23, 2009, ZeniMax Media, parent company of Bethesda Softworks, acquired id Software and announced that future id games would be published by Bethesda Softworks, including Doom 4.[38] Id Software creative director Tim Willits announced that key releases would be much sooner and that the partnership allowed id Software to have two teams, each having a project in parallel development, for the first time.[39] Carmack added that, once Rage was complete, its development team would move to Doom 4. Doom 4 might also feature dedicated servers unlike Rage.[40]

Initial reception of the QuakeCon 2014 trailer accumulated considerable acclaim among fans,[105] and initial reception of the E3 2015 trailer was also positive, despite receiving criticisms by some critics, who considered the game to be too violent.[106] Pete Hines from Bethesda Softworks responded by saying that the game is designed to allow players to apply violence on demons instead of humans. Hines added that, "if you're not into violent, bloody games... Doom's probably not a game for you."[107]
It all kind of gets tossed into a big pot of soup, and you're saying, "Does it feel fun, or does it not feel fun?", and then you make your decisions along those lines, but I think [the progression system]'ll be an important part of Doom, and I think people will be excited about it when they get a sense of what we're doing.

On July 2, 2015, Stratton revealed that the game would not take place on Earth and that, unlike Doom 3, the game was comic and "very juvenile".[41] Director Hugo Martin later said that the game was heavily inspired by rock and roll and He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and that its Hell-themed levels would feature much heavy metal. Doom's world was designed to have personality and be "over the top"; the UAC industrial field was designed to be the massive underbelly of the corporation, the UAC corporate field zone was designed to be much cleaner in terms of splattered goriness than the other zones to prevent repetition. Skulls were used in Hell as iconic elements and the Titan's Realm zone was constructed from dead, ancient, colossal demons.[2] At QuakeCon 2015, it was announced that the game would run at 1080p and 60 frames per second on console, as id considered it "the most necessary graphical goal" which could effectively improve gameplay fluidity.[62] According to Martin, the team put little emphasis on story, as they believed that it was not an important feature of the franchise.[63] Instead, they added codex items to let interested players speculate about the story and the identity of the player character.[64]

Subsequent benchmarks show up to a 66% improvement in the frame rates on AMD graphics cards, with minor changes in the performance of Nvidia cards.[93]

He makes another excursion into Hell by activating the accumulator of a contained Cyberdemon that he defeats and fights through a labyrinthine gauntlet to recover the Crucible from a trio of Hell Guards. Arriving at VEGA's facility in the frozen north, he makes a backup copy of the AI and destroys the facility. The explosion of VEGA's core allows the Slayer to enter the Well, where he uses the Crucible to destroy the portal's power source. Finally, he confronts Pierce, who is betrayed and transformed by the demons into the monstrous Spider Mastermind. She attempts to kill the Slayer but is eventually defeated.

Doom was well-received by critics and players. The single-player campaign, graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay received considerable praise, with reviewers crediting the game for recapturing the spirit of the classic Doom games and first-person shooters of the 1990s, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most significant criticism. It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK a few weeks after its release and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same time period. A sequel titled Doom Eternal was released in March 2020.

Polygon's Arthur Gies remarked positively upon the exploration for collectables and secrets, and their relevance to the new upgrade feature, but he was critical of instances where the game would lock away sections of a level without warning.[121] Zack Furniss of Destructoid was originally skeptical regarding the "glory kills" feature, as were other critics, fearing that they might distract from the fast-paced gameplay. He ultimately considered them to fit well in the flow of gameplay that keeps players in the middle of combat without a slowed pace.[112] Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker felt that the glory kills' generating small amounts of health and armor "makes them an essential part of the give-and-take of Doom's super fast combat; do you dart into the fray for a glory kill to get a little health back, and risk getting mobbed by all the other enemies around?"[118] Conversely, Kyle Orland of Ars Technica felt that the glory kills' briefly taking control away from the player can easily disorient players or misposition them, finding them hard to ignore for players that choose not to use them.[134]

id felt the greatest challenge was to compete with other first-person shooters such as Call of Duty and Battlefield, as younger players were less familiar with the older Doom franchise. They also found it difficult to establish a game with its own identity while "being faithful" to other games in the series. The team consulted the game directors at Bethesda Game Studios, who Stratton considered "[had gone] through the same thing when they were working on Fallout 3."[59]
Doom is a 2016 first-person shooter game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the first major installment in the Doom series since 2004's Doom 3. Players take the role of an unnamed space marine, known as the "Doom Slayer", as he battles demonic forces from Hell that have been unleashed by the Union Aerospace Corporation within their energy-mining facility on Mars. The gameplay returns to a faster pace with more open-ended levels, closer to the first two games than the slower survival horror approach of Doom 3. It also features environment traversal, character upgrades, and the ability to perform executions known as "glory kills".

Fights also require the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to better utilize the advantages of fight arenas and bonuses. They also need to decide which enemies should be prioritized and how to move around on the battlefield.[6][7][8]
The game's single-player elements received critical acclaim. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun favorably compared Doom to the 2014 game Wolfenstein: The New Order, also published by Bethesda, but added that Doom's quality surpassed that of Wolfenstein due to its fast pace and solid gunplay.[133] Peter Brown of GameSpot praised single-player because he thought that the reboot captured the spirits of the older games, while refining them with modern elements. Brown also drew attention toward the soundtrack, calling it "impactful".[116] Mike Henriquez of Game Revolution favored the visual and artistic design, calling it "top-notch".[115] Sam White in The Daily Telegraph commended id Software for Doom's delivery of performance on all platforms and praised the weapon design for Doom's continuity to introduce new weapons at a perfect speed so that gamers always play with something new and exciting.[125]
Many of the levels have multiple pathways and open areas, which allow players to explore and find collectibles and secrets throughout the levels. Many of these collectibles can be used as part of Doom's progression system, including weapon mods, rune powers, and Praetor Suit upgrades. Weapon mods come from field drones and allow the player to unlock alternate modes of fire for many weapons, such as explosive shots and different rate and output of firepower. Each of the weapons' firing modes can be further upgraded using weapon tokens, but they can only be maxed out by completing a challenge related to that particular firing mode. Runes transport the player to a separate arena to perform a combat challenge that grants different abilities when successfully completed, such as better equipment drops from fallen enemies. Players can also upgrade their "Praetor Suit" by retrieving special tokens from dead marines and using them to improve functionality such as equipment, navigation and resistances.[14] Other pickups include small Doomguy figurines that allow the player to view 3D models of different characters, and data files that expand on the characters and story.[15]

On September 13, 2017, it was announced via Nintendo Direct that Doom would release on Nintendo Switch during the fourth quarter of 2017.[95] The retail Switch version differs from the other console versions in that the multiplayer component is not included in the base product, but is instead offered as a free download, whereas the SnapMap component is not included at all, both changes as a result of cartridge limitations.[96] It was released on November 10, 2017.[97] An update to the Switch version in February 2018 introduced the option to use the motion controls of the Joy-Con for aiming, similar to other Switch games such as Splatoon 2 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.[98]
In April 2013, Kotaku published an exposé describing Doom 4 as trapped in "development hell". Citing connections to id, the article claimed that Doom 4 had suffered under mismanagement and that development was completely restarted in 2011. Inside sources described the pre-2011 version—which was to portray the uprising of Hell on Earth—as heavily scripted and cinematic, comparing it to the Call of Duty franchise. The pre-2011 version was criticized as mediocre and the new version as "lame" and a "mess".[44] While Hollenshead initially stated that the Doom 4 team was doing something that fans would be happy with,[45] id's Willits criticized the game's lack of character in QuakeCon 2013.[43] In July 2015, Marty Stratton criticized Doom 4's lack of personality as id's primary reason to cancel the game, and pointed out its similarities to the Call of Duty franchise and that the game was not the product that id thought people wanted.[46]

According to the game's executive producer Marty Stratton, the key principles of Doom's single-player mode are "badass demons, big effing guns, and moving really fast".[1] The game allows players to perform movements such as double jumps and ledge climbs throughout levels of industrial and corporate fields of a Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on Mars and then levels of Hell,[2] as the combat system puts emphasis upon momentum and speed.[3] The approach is known as "push-forward combat", which discourages players from taking cover behind obstacles or resting to regain health while playing from the Doom Slayer's perspective.[4] Players instead collect health and armor pick-ups by killing enemies. "Glory kills" is a newly-introduced melee execution system; when enough damage has been dealt to an enemy, the game will highlight it and allow the player to perform a quick and violent melee takedown, rewarding the player with small health recovery.[5]

Players are granted experience points upon each match. After they have collected sufficient experience points, players can level up, by which new armor, skins, weapons, and power-ups would be unlocked for players to use. Both the player character and weapon can be customized extensively by applying new skins and colors onto them.[19] In addition, players can receive hack modules while playing the game, which are special abilities that can only be used once after they are collected. There are over six types of modules. Scout reveals the locations of all enemies to the player for a limited time after respawning, while Vital Signs shows all enemies' health. Retribution allows players to track their last killer by revealing that player's health and location, while Power Seeker guides players to the power weapon pickup in the game. The Resupply Timer, meanwhile, shows the respawn time of the power-up items.[20] Players can also perform taunts in the game's multiplayer.[21]

The game features a large arsenal of weapons which can be collected and freely switched by players throughout the game and require no reloading. Recurring weapons of the series also make a return, including the super shotgun and BFG 9000. The BFG has a very small ammunition capacity, but is extremely powerful. Similarly, the chainsaw returns, but has been reintroduced as a special-use weapon[9] that relies upon fuel, but can be used to instantly cut through enemies and provide a greater-than-normal drop of ammunition for the player.[10]

The multiplayer mode, however, garnered a mixed reception from critics. IGN's Joab Gilory was less favorable toward the multiplayer, calling the overall game "a tale of two very different shooters", stating that multiplayer did not live up to the standard set by the single-player components and would not satisfy players.[119] Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com found the multiplayer to be only alright.[122] Matt Buchholtz of EGM criticized what he felt was the network's poor handling of latency, and failing to register on-target shots as hits in some instances while not in others.[113] Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of Eurogamer singled out the "Warpath" multiplayer mode as the most interesting of the match type, describing it as "memorable", while he regarded the other multiplayer modes as underdeveloped and underwhelming.[137] Julian Benson from Kotaku wrote that Doom's multiplayer was very similar to other modern games.[138] More positively, however, David Houghton of GamesRadar enjoyed the multiplayer for the fast pace yet quick decision-making needed to succeed, calling it "endlessly playable, smart, brutal fun."[117] Doom was placed 1st in the GamesRadar's list of top FPS games of all time.[139]

In a 2016 video documentary by Noclip, Doom creative director Hugo Martin described the "Hell on Earth" premise as: "It was like Robert Zemeckis. See Contact, like, if this really happened. Now let's be clear: it was awesome. But it was more realistic. It was about the global impact of a Hellish invasion."[47] The creative director of the Doom 4 prototype, Kevin Cloud, said in the same interview, "As far as the upper-level creative direction, that was me driving that.

On February 23, 2016, Doom was made available for Xbox One owners to pre-order; for a limited time, they would also get the two original games, Doom and Doom II, for free. Other bonuses included the Demon Multiplayer Pack, which offered a demon-themed armor set with three skin variations; six metallic paint colors and three id Software logo patterns used for character customization; and six sets of consumable Hack Module perks.[83][84] There is also a Collector's Edition, which was significantly more expensive than the normal edition. It includes a figurine of the Revenant – a demon featured in the game – and a metal case.[85]

Doom was released to positive reception regarding the fast-paced gameplay, single-player campaign, visuals and soundtrack whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode. Many critics believed that Doom was a successful return to form for the series. Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on Metacritic. The Nintendo Switch edition, released in November 2017, was also positively received by professional reviewers, garnering a 79/100 on Metacritic: most reviewers praised the job of the port, also conceding that it was not as well optimized as it was for previous consoles. The final version of the game received very positive reviews from users on Steam.[130] It also received praise from other video game creators, including Cliff Bleszinski[131] and Greg Kasavin, who said that the game answers questions that other modern shooters do not answer.[132]
At the 2011 QuakeCon, Carmack mentioned that the new Doom would be using a new scripting language based on C++ and called it "super-script", a superset of C++ with features such as scheduling and type safety.[40] At the end of 2012, the team decided to make Doom 4 a reboot.[41] In November 2013, Carmack left id Software to commit to his work at Oculus VR.[42]

The SnapMap mode was also positively received with Hardcore Gamer's Jordan Helm's noting the possibilities yet simplicity with its use, calling it an "admirable feat".[135] Matt Peckham of Time thought that the mode added further value to the overall package of the game.[136] Matt Bertz of Game Informer commented upon the accessibility but criticized the lack of diverse settings and possible limitations when compared to a traditional community-based mod.[114] James Davenport of PC Gamer compared it to the modification in the original games, which he views as one of the primary reasons why Doom is still a recognizable title. He was disappointed by the lack of mod support, though he nevertheless noted SnapMap for its simple use and variety of ideas already created by players.[120]

The Doom soundtrack was composed by Mick Gordon, with additional contributions by Richard Devine. Gordon aimed to treat the game's original soundtrack with "utmost respect" while modernizing it; however, the team at id stipulated in the initial brief that they wanted "no guitars" on the soundtrack, fearing that it would make the game "feel like Bill & Ted"[69] and that heavy metal music itself has become "a bit of a joke".[70] Gordon's initial concept was based around the idea of Argent energy corrupting human-made devices; to mirror this in music, he fed basic waveforms – sine waves and white noise – through a complex array of effects units such as distortion and compression.[70] While this resulted in a unique electronic sound, the game still was not "sounding like Doom"; Gordon then gradually started adding more and more guitar elements, which eventually resulted in the desired tone and feel for the game; Gordon used seven- and eight-string guitars to give the music a lower tone, and used a nine-string guitar for the game's main theme, a variation on Bobby Prince's "E1M1" / "At DOOM's Gate" theme;[71] Gordon would eventually admit that using a nine-string was "kinda stupid" in its excess, and that while he eventually sold the guitar to Fredrik Thordendal from Meshuggah, "even he can't find a use for it".[70] The soundtrack contains numerous easter eggs: some songs reference themes or sounds from older Doom games, others contain backmasking ("Jesus loves you"), images of pentagrams and the number 666 embedded into the sound via steganography. Gordon intended these as a joke, and never thought anyone would find them,[70] but they were discovered shortly after release and widely covered in the media.[72][73][74]

Doom takes place during the year 2149[b] in a research facility located in the Hellas Planitia on Mars owned by the Union Aerospace Corporation. The facility is run by Dr. Samuel Hayden, a UAC scientist whose mind now inhabits an android body after having lost his original to brain cancer. Researchers at the UAC facility have attempted to draw energy from Hell, a newly discovered alternative dimension inhabited by demons, in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth. They accomplish this using the Argent Tower, a structure which siphons "Argent Energy" from Hell and allows travel to and from the other side.[28] In addition to their energy harvesting work, Hayden organizes several expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. Among them is a sarcophagus containing the Doom Slayer (along with his armor, the Praetor Suit).

In all of its platforms except the Nintendo Switch, Doom includes a built-in level creation tool called "SnapMap" which allows players to create and edit maps with their own structure and game logic.[23] With SnapMap, players can create maps for different modes, ranging from single-player levels to co-operative or competitive multiplayer maps. When players are building a level, the game will shift to a top-down view. Players can place rooms and hallways to form a level and connect them together. If they are not connected together, the color of the construction pieces changes to notify the player. Players can also use the X-ray camera which temporarily removes all the walls to allow players to view the objects inside. Players can also place enemies into their maps, with the exception of the campaign's bosses. Their artificial intelligence and stats, and the player's own movement speed can also be modified. Players can also add additional particle effects, lighting effects, and other gameplay items, such as health packs and ammo pick-ups.[24] Only in-game assets can be used, and players cannot create or import their own models into the game.[25] Levels can be tested before they are published online.[24]

According to Stratton and Martin, movement is the game's most important pillar. To help keep movement fast, weapon reloading was excluded and levels were designed to discourage players from hiding.[5] On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of nonlinear exploration and stated that combat is the game's focus and that the difficulty of the game was raised with the aim of creating an ultimate first-person shooter.[citation needed] On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to evoke the game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.[65]

Doom was announced as Doom 4 in 2008, and that version underwent an extensive development cycle with different builds and designs before the game was restarted in 2011 and revealed as simply Doom in 2014. It was tested by customers who pre-ordered the 2014 Bethesda game Wolfenstein: The New Order and also by the general public. Mick Gordon composed the music for the game, with additional music contributed by Ben F. Carney, Chris Hite, and Chad Mossholder. The game also supports an online multiplayer component and a level editor known as "SnapMap", co-developed with Certain Affinity and Escalation Studios respectively. It was released worldwide on PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in May 2016. A port for Nintendo Switch was co-developed with Panic Button and released in November 2017, and a version for Google Stadia was released in August 2020.
In Doom's multiplayer mode, several modes, such as team deathmatch and its variation "Soul Harvest", as well as Freeze Tag, Warpath (King of the Hill with a moving 'hill'), Domination, and "Clan Arena" (team last man standing with no pickups), exist within the game.[16] Players can also use power-ups and teleporters in a multiplayer match. They can pick up a Demon Rune, one of the power-ups featured, to transform into and fight as a demon. There are four demons available initially in the game, each of which has different abilities: the Revenant, the Baron of Hell, the Mancubus, and the Prowler.[17] At launch, the game featured nine maps.[18]

After the game's redesign began, Willits revealed in August 2013 that Doom was still the team's focus.[48] British science fiction writer Graham Joyce was enlisted to write the game's story; after Joyce died in 2014, Adam Gascoine was brought in as a replacement.[49] Sound designer Chad Mossholder was recruited to write flavor text, after the team found out he writes comics.[50]

During the open multiplayer beta, IGN writer Nathan Lawrence called the beta disappointing, considering it less of a classic style "arena shooter" and unfavorable compared to other shooters such as Halo.[108] Similarly, the beta was negatively received by players on Steam, with mostly negative reviews at the time when the beta was active.[109] Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Adam Smith found the beta both to be similar to games such as Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, and the Call of Duty series and not to feel like Doom itself, and criticized the weapon loadout concept.[110] Review copies of the game were held back until release day.[111]

Update 6.66 features a revised progression system, all three DLC bundled into the core game, a new 'rune' system (replacing the Hack Module system) and enhanced kill notifications. To accommodate this new progression system, Update 6.66 also reset all players' multiplayer experience progression, but not without giving players the option whether to retain all unlocked items or reset them. Players who played before Update 6.66 and players who obtained the 'Slayer' level received unique medals to show their status.[22]

Humorous aspects of the conversion take the form of ironic in-jokes related to Doom resulting from the more or less exact "translation" of previous non-essential Doom decorations into their non-essential Chex Quest equivalents. Thus the bloodied bodies and the twitching torsos from Doom become the goo-covered cereal pieces and the cereal victims twitching to extract themselves from goo in Chex Quest. Likewise, according to the plot the "health" meter represents the Chex Warrior's ability to move, with 0% representing being completely covered in slime and unable to move. The picture of the Chex Warrior in the status bar display becomes progressively more coated in slime, as opposed to bleeding as does the face in Doom. Because time was limited, pre-existing tools popular with the Doom fan community (such as the level creation tool Doombuilder) were utilized in level design, and sound effects such as the distinctive vocalization of the Flemoids were created by creative director Dean Hyers and audio designer Andrew Benson playing around in a sound booth.[18]
Originally based on the Doom engine, the gameplay present in Chex Quest is substantially identical to its predecessor.[1] The game is played in a first person perspective with the player character navigating through quasi-3D environments while enemies attempt to attack and immobilize him. Along the way, various cereal-themed power-ups, weapons, and ammunition can be found that can boost the player character's health and make him better able to counterattack or flee his enemies. When the final boss is defeated in the last level, the game is won.

The development of Chex Quest differed from traditional video game development in that the basic game engine had already been created and the bulk of the creation process consisted of aesthetic changes made to the music and artwork from The Ultimate Doom. For budgetary reasons, Id Software was contacted and an inexpensive license was obtained for the Doom engine which was considered obsolete in light of Id's recently released Quake. Chex Quest was the first foray into professional game development for lead artist Charles Jacobi and programmer Scott Holman, though both had previously modded Doom levels in the past. In an interview with PC Gamer magazine in 2009, Jacobi stated that the biggest reason for the lasting success of Chex Quest has been that it is still essentially a disguised version of Doom with basically unaltered game dynamics.[10] Indeed, the game has been recognized for having a sense of humor about its identity and origins.[17]
Episode intermission texts which originally (i.e. in Doom) were displayed upon completion of E1M8, E2M8, E3M8, and E4M8 are now found in modified form for Chex Quest.[23][24] Thus completion of E1M5 in Chex Quest now displays the new message: "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THE NEXT MISSION? PRESS THE ESCAPE KEY TO CONTINUE..."[25] Completion of the leftover level E2M5 displays the message: "YOU'VE DONE IT!!"[26] which never appears in The Ultimate Doom.[24] Likewise, the episode intermission text displayed upon completion of E3M5 reads: "WONDERFUL JOB!",[27] and that displayed upon completion of E4M5 reads: "FANTASTIC"[28] again neither of which ever appeared in the original game. Charles Jacobi has said that there were never any plans to produce more than five levels[18] and that he knew Scott Holman, another programmer, ran through the text strings and changed any that seemed inappropriate, without knowing where they went.

Produced with a small team of developers on a budget of around $500,000, Chex Quest began life as the brainchild of the WatersMolitor promotion agency – an award-winning group that had been hired by Ralston Foods[nb 1] to reinvigorate the Chex cereal brand.[11] The original game concept was created by Dean Hyers and Mike Koenigs as a non-violent CD-ROM computer game to be released with 5.7 million boxes of Rice Chex, Wheat Chex, and Corn Chex cereals[3] in order to cast Chex as a cereal that was exciting and fun for children while appealing to modern sensibilities by targeting home PC owners.[6] The game would be a high-quality program whose normal retail value would be between $30[3] and $35.[11] However, it would be offered to consumers for free[6] with no increase to the cost of the cereal box.[15]

Chex Quest has only the first five levels from The Ultimate Doom converted for the game.[23] Some leftover levels are playable (as Chex Quest conversions) only via the level warp parameter at startup.[24] These leftover levels include maps 6 through 9 from episode 1 as well as all maps in episodes 2, 3, and 4. In these levels the music reverts to the original score from Ultimate Doom. After the level warp parameter is used to access maps E3M1 or E4M1, the remainder of the levels (through map 5) within the episode selected can be accessed by completing the levels in the episode in order (just as with the standard level progression in Doom or Chex Quest). Unfortunately, bugs prevent any of the other levels from launching upon completion of the level before it, and similarly E4M9 cannot be reached from E4M2 as previously. Completion of E2M5 (via either exit) displays the end graphic originally displayed at the end of The Shores Of Hell, the second episode of the original Doom, and completing E3M5 displays the end sequence from Inferno, the third episode. Likewise, completing E4M5 displays the end graphic from Thy Flesh Consumed, the fourth and final episode of The Ultimate Doom. Both of the latter two end sequences feature a decapitated rabbit named Daisy.[23]
In this sequel's plot, the Chex Warrior returns to his home planet and lands in Chex City only to discover that the Flemoid threat has reached his homeworld. There, the player battles through a terrestrial spaceport, a cinema (showing three videos each endlessly looping), a museum, and the eponymous city (Chextropolis), until reaching the sewers to confront an end boss named "The Maximus".

A few notable differences from Doom are evident, however, regarding enemy profiles (specifically the loss of long-range attacks in low-level enemies and the loss of movement in high-level enemies) and the number of levels in each world (restricted to 5 levels in Chex Quest).[15]
During development, aesthetic decisions had to be run by Ralston for approval and this resulted in a number of modifications. The zorchers, for instance, were originally intended to look like a classic raygun, though they were changed to look like a remote control or Star Trek tricorder due to Ralston's concerns that it looked too much like a violent gun. All of the higher-powered weapons were then designed on the tricorder model. However, the Zorch launcher and Phasing Zorcher were modified again toward the end of the design phase to have a more distinctive look. Zorch weapons were also originally going to "neutralize" flemoids with nutritional foods like banana slices, milk, and strawberries, but due to Ralston's worries that this might encourage food fighting, this was changed so that the zorcher emitted pink light and "sent back" the flemoids, making them vanish. Early designs for the Chex Warrior also had his head and body all as one giant Chex piece. However, this was changed due to aesthetic similarities to the M&M's animated characters. The flemoids were originally yellow, but this was changed to green due to limitations in the Doom color palette.[19]

In response to an interview question regarding the possibility of a canonical Kickstarter-funded Chex Quest 4, Jacobi pointed out that the franchise is owned by General Mills so a funded project would likely violate copyright and trademark laws. However, freely distributed non-tarnishing modifications created by hobbyists would probably be protected as free speech.[18]
On release, the game was received largely positively by players. Consumers of diverse ages gave enthusiastic feedback, and there were many requests for the development of sequels.[6][11] Corporate sales of Chex cereal also saw a tremendous boost with incremental volume over base increasing by 295% and volume share increasing 48% from the previous year.[6][11] These increases were directly attributed to the release of Chex Quest, and General Mills deemed the promotion "highly successful."[29] Although the promotion only lasted 6 weeks, the game continued to be played well beyond the promotional period and promotional marketing groups considered the brand image to have been revitalized "from old-fashioned and stodgy to exciting, fun and modern."[6]

Similarities have been drawn by fans between Chex Quest and GoldenEye with respect to the legal rights to the game subsequent to the original creators' purchase by larger companies.[12] These corporate events have made the likelihood of later official sequels rather uncertain. As with GoldenEye, however, Chex Quest still has a devoted cult fanbase who still create fan-art, new WAD files, and even full sequels to the game 20 years after the game's original release—a fact that has been used to highlight the capacity for PC games to foster and support community innovation.[12][44]
Some parameters used to start Doom are also used to start Chex Quest. DespiteChex Quest's major changes from its predecessor, there are still a few remaining relics (e.g. levels from other Ultimate Doom episodes and some in-game text).

Chex Quest is a non-violent first-person shooter video game created in 1996 by Digital Café, originally intended as a Chex cereal promotion aimed at children aged 6–9 and up.[2][3] It is a total conversion of the more explicitly violent video game Doom (specifically The Ultimate Doom version of the game). Chex Quest won both the Golden EFFIE Award for Advertising Effectiveness in 1996[4][5] and the Golden Reggie Award for Promotional Achievement in 1998,[4][6] and it is known today for having been the first video game ever to be included in cereal boxes as a prize.[7][8] The game's cult following[9] has been described by the press as being composed of unusually devoted fans of an advertising vehicle from a bygone age.[10][11][12]

The skins for the more difficult enemies from Doom have not been converted as these enemies were not employed in Chex Quest levels, but rather the skins have been removed entirely.[23] This introduces an additional experience for those playing the "leftover levels" as these difficult enemies still exist in a completely invisible form.[24] This also goes for items like the partial invisibility, berserker pack, light amp goggles, and all skull keycards. In addition, the music from the original registered Doom as well as the overworld graphics (depicting Gigeresque scenes of death and hell) and maps that were not modified (E1M6 through E4M9) were left intact,[23] allowing anybody with WAD file editing knowledge to create their own copy of registered Doom (specifically The Ultimate Doom).

Set on a distant planet named Bazoik, the game follows the Chex Warrior, a soldier clad in a Chex-shaped suit of armor, as he foils the invasion of the planet by the 'Flemoids':[11] a species of slimy, green invertebrates, who have infested the planet and captured many helpless colonists, whom the Chex Warrior must save.[16] His main weapons are devices called "zorchers", which teleports his enemies to their home dimension.[3] The game starts at the landing pad of the research center on Bazoik; other levels include the laboratory, the arboretum, and finally, the caverns of Bazoik, where the Flemoids have established their colony. Their principal weapon is the use of mucus as a projectile.
Chex Quest has gained a devoted fanbase since its cereal-box release in 1996. Often simultaneous fans of Chex cereal[38] and the Doom series, the active Chex Quest fan community has produced a host of fan-made sequels, and numerous unofficial projects have been undertaken including the Chex Trek series and the Zorchmatch mod.[12] Other examples which have arguably entered the fanon include a fan-made Chex Quest 3[18] and Chex Quest 4, and such .wad and Game Maker sequels as Return of the Chex Warrior, Chex Quest Project Z, and the Chex Quest platformer. There are fan-made Chex Quest WADs designed for nearly all major Doom source ports, even the original Doom engine.

While Doom has a cheat code scheme in which every cheat starts with "id", the codes in Chex Quest are based on the names of the people in the production crew of the game, with a few exceptions.[22] PC speaker sound effects from the MS-DOS version of Doom have been modified and are used in Chex Quest. Whereas Doom is rated M for Mature, Chex Quest was made to be a child-friendly game for all audiences. Nearly all of the graphics and audio from Doom have been replaced, from textures to enemies to weapons.

In 2016, Jacobi revealed that a high definition remake of the original game called Chex Quest HD was in development using Unreal Engine 4 with the permission of General Mills.[41] A trailer for the remake was released in February 2019. Like the original game it will contain five levels and be released for free.[42] The Chex Warrior, the protagonist of the original game, is given the name Fred Chexter in the remake.

In modern times, Chex Quest is often considered to have been highly innovative[32][33] and to have pioneered the use of licensed modding to insert product placement into established titles.[34] Although at least 5 million copies were released, the original CDs are uncommon on the secondary market as they were noted by collectors as having great collectible value in the mid-1990s.[35] The game has attracted a sizeable cult following, and its fanbase has been noted with interest by critics for the continued devotion to the game despite its great age.[12] Other critics, however, have characterized the game as bad even for a Doom clone.[36]

The plot for this sequel is set ten years later than the events of the first two Chex Quest games, with the invasion of the planet Ralston by the Flemoids. The breadth of the story was expanded to a much larger scale, possessing a seemingly more grim scenario than the predecessors—the latter of which Charles Jacobi dispelled as unintentional, in that he simply "wanted it to feel bigger" than the first two games.[18]

In 2008, Chex Quest 3 was developed and released as a service to fans[17] by former Digital Café members Charles Jacobi (art director and lead artist) and Scott Holman (programmer).[10] Former Digital Café sound design leader Andrew Benson also contributed several songs for the game. Originally intended as a single standalone level, Jacobi announced the development of a full sequel at the Chex Quest Fan Page (Chexquest.org) in June 2008, and the full game was released in September of the same year.[38] Chex Quest 3 employs the ZDoom source port (version 2.3.1),[39] and is considerably larger in size than the previous two games.[18] Jacobi's release of Chex Quest 3 also included ZDoom-based versions of Chex Quest and Chex Quest 2,[40] with significant enhancements and noted problems redressed. Chex Quest 2 in particular had been remastered, with some levels significantly revised or completely overhauled.[18] Charles Jacobi credited the praise and compliments of fans, especially through fan-made projects such as one titled "The Ultimate Chex Quest", as inspiration to complete this project.[18] If anyone wishes to play Chex Quest 3 in latest versions of ZDoom and GZDoom, then download Chex Quest 3 (version 1.4, dated 24 June 2009) and extract its contents, download the latest version of the desired port, then copy the chex3.wad file into the ZDoom or GZDoom folder.
The Forgotten First-Person Shooters You Need to Play: Chex Quest
Despite this, what little critical attention Chex Quest received in the video game press tended to be negative. Comparisons of the game to its forerunner (Doom) and to other similar games of the day were often unfavorable to Chex Quest, which was pejoratively labeled a "Doom clone", and the game was regarded as an imitation with little to no innovation.[30] Noted cereal scholar Scott Bruce decried General Mills' decision to invent a new mascot for Chex cereal for such frivolous purposes, and dismissed the Chex Warrior as not compelling enough to sell the product.[31]
