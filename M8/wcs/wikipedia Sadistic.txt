Throughout the years, Sadistic Intent has toured in various countries around the world such as Norway, Brazil, Finland, Mexico, Germany, Chile, Holland, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Greece, Belgium, Australia, Singapore, France and the US.
After the demise of Los Angeles, California's Devastation, which formed in 1986, Sadistic Intent began in 1987. The band quickly changed its line-up, then released a few rehearsal tapes and in early 1989 released the Conflict Within demo, which the band pushed and distributed through the international underground scene. Eventually Sadistic Intent signed with a rising label, Wild Rags Records. In 1990, the Impending Doom EP was released and a few tours followed in Mexico as well as the United States. The following year, after bitter disputes with the label, they moved on and self-released a limited edition (1,000 copies) 7-inch EP A Calm Before The Storm. Due to line-up problems, the band would not do any live appearances until 1993.

Eventually by 2007, Jeff Becerra asked Rick and Bay Cortez (the founding members of Sadistic Intent) if they would be interested in doing more Possessed songs and it was then when Becerra decided to call it Possessed, and Sadistic Intent became the members of that band from 2007 through 2010. After that split-up, in 2011 it was announced that drummer Nick Barker (Lock Up and Dimmu Borgir) had joined Sadistic Intent; however, logistically it became too difficult to take place. After taking care of that line-up change with the addition of current drummer Arthur Mendiola in 2011, the next Sadistic Intent release was recorded in 2013 and released in 2014 titled Reawakening Horrid Thoughts, a 12-inch laser-etched EP through Iron Pegasus Records.

In 1994, Sadistic Intent recorded the Resurrection MCD (released through Gothic Records, the re-press would then be done by Dark Realm Records in 1995) with bassist Bay Cortez singing for the first time. After sorting out another line-up problem in 1996, they recorded a tribute song to Celtic Frost for Dwell Records. In 1997, they then released Ancient Black Earth as a limited edition (500 hand-numbered copies) MCD through their own record label, Dark Realm Records. In 1998, a split 7-inch EP with the German black metal group Ungod was released through the German record label Merciless Records. 1999 saw more tribute recordings and releases from Sadistic Intent. One was for a Dwell Records tribute to Los Angeles metal band Slayer and the other for California's Possessed, which featured original Possessed front man Jeff Becerra on vocals. By 2000, Sadistic Intent licensed its Resurrection of the Ancient Black Earth LP to Germany's Iron Pegasus Records, which also released the Morbid Faith 7-inch EP in 2002.
Sadistic Intent is a death metal band from Los Angeles.

Treating sadism is difficult, but it looks like psychotherapy can help in certain cases. Note: It has not been proven that people with sadism can be successfully treated. The former statement is not accurate.
These kind of people usually enjoy when others are hurt, but specific ones love pain in general. Most of the time people who are masochistic or sadistic are sad in real life.
Sadism is a condition in which people get pleasure from humiliating, harming or hurting others. Often the pleasure is of a sexual kind.When a person finds pleasure in being hurt or humiliated, their condition is called Masochism.

The condition is often fetishized on the internet and sometimes related to self-doubt or self-hate.
The terms "sadism" and "masochism" were both invented by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, a German psychiatrist. He named Sadism after the Marquis de Sade, a French nobleman who in the eighteenth century wrote many books, stories and plays. Sade's books include many characters who find pleasure in cruelty, including torture and even murder.
Schorsch, Eberhard und Becker, Nikolaus: 'Angst, Lust Zerstörung-Sadismus als soz. u. kriminelles Handeln. Zur Psychodynamik sexueller Tötungen' (2000) Psychosozial-Verlag, ISBN 3-89806-048-9
At first Sadism meant only cruelty for sexual pleasure, but as the word became more widely used its meaning changed. Nowadays any person who enjoys being cruel to others can be called "sadistic," even if they get no sexual excitement from what they do.
Some people who have sadistic sexual fantasies mean no real harm to anyone. In BDSM a "top" or dominant person will bind his or her partner or "punish" them in different ways, but what they do will not go beyond limits which the partner has agreed on. On the other hand, a small minority are severely perverted or mentally ill, and wish to act out their sadistic fantasies for real. Such people are rare, but they can be very dangerous. Many serial killers and psychopaths have been sexual sadists.

Those convicted for church burnings showed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic "retaliation" against Christianity in Norway.[107] Mayhem drummer Hellhammer said he had called for attacks on mosques and Hindu temples, on the basis that they were more foreign.[108] Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Many musicians, singers, and songwriters in the early Norwegian black metal scene, such as Infernus and Gaahl of Gorgoroth, continue to praise the church burnings, with the latter saying "there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them".[16] Others, such as Necrobutcher and Kjetil Manheim of Mayhem and Abbath of Immortal,[16] see the church burnings as having been futile. Manheim claimed that many arsons were "just people trying to gain acceptance" within the black metal scene.[90] Watain vocalist Erik Danielsson respected the attacks, but said of those responsible: "the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course".[109]

Ambient black metal is a style of black metal that relies on heavy incorporation of atmospheric, sometimes dreamy textures, and is therefore less aggressive. It often features synthesizers or classical instrumentation, typically for melody or ethereal "shimmering" over the wall of sound provided by the guitars. The music is usually slow to mid paced with rare blast beat usage, without any abrupt changes and generally features slowly developing, sometimes repetitive melodies and riffs, which separate it from other black metal styles. Subject matter usually concerns nature, folklore, mythology, and personal introspection.[178] Artists include Agalloch[179] and Wolves in the Throne Room.[179]

Euronymous made necklaces with bits of Dead's skull and gave some to musicians he deemed worthy.[16] Rumors also spread that he had made a stew with bits of his brain.[39][90] Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's evil image and claimed Dead had killed himself because extreme metal had become trendy and commercialized.[95] Mayhem bassist Jørn 'Necrobutcher' Stubberud noted that "people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene".[96]

Unblack metal (or Christian black metal) is a subgenre that promotes Christianity through its lyrics and imagery.[295] The first unblack metal record, Hellig Usvart (1994) by Australian artist Horde, was a provocative parody of Norwegian black metal. It sparked controversy, and death threats were issued against Horde. Norwegian unblack metal band Antestor was originally formed as a death/doom band bearing a different name, Crush Evil.

Melechesh was formed in Jerusalem in 1993, "the first overtly anti-Christian band to exist in one of the holiest cities in the world".[168] Melechesh began as a straightforward black metal act with their first foray into folk metal occurring on their 1996 EP The Siege of Lachish.[169] Their subsequent albums straddled black, death, and thrash metal.[170] Another band, Arallu, was formed in the late 1990s and has relationships with Melechesh and Salem.[171][172] Melechesh and Arallu perform a style they call "Mesopotamian Black Metal", a blend of black metal and Mesopotamian folk music.[168][172]

In 1992, members of the Norwegian black metal scene began a wave of arson attacks on Christian churches. By 1996, there had been at least 50 such attacks in Norway.[101] Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. The first to be burnt down was Norway's Fantoft Stave Church. Police believe Varg Vikernes of Burzum was responsible.[101] The cover of Burzum's EP Aske ("ashes") is a photograph of the destroyed church.[102] In May 1994, Vikernes was found guilty for burning down the Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church, and Åsane Church.[85][103] In addition, he was found guilty for an attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives.[104] To coincide with the release of Mayhem's De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, Vikernes and Euronymous had also allegedly plotted to bomb the Nidaros Cathedral, which appears on the album cover. The musicians Faust,[105] Samoth,[104] (both of Emperor), and Jørn Inge Tunsberg (of Hades Almighty)[104][101] were also convicted for church arsons. Members of the Swedish black metal scene started to burn churches as well in 1993.[106]

Many black-metallers see "Christian black metal" as an oxymoron[336] and believe black metal cannot be Christian.[39] In fact, the early unblack metal groups Horde and Antestor refused to call their music "black metal" because they did not share its ethos. Horde called its music "holy unblack metal"[337] and Antestor called theirs "sorrow metal".[338] Horde's Jayson Sherlock later said "I will never understand why Christians think they can play Black Metal. I really don't think they understand what true Black Metal is".[339] However, current unblack metal bands such as Crimson Moonlight feel that black metal has changed from an ideological movement to a purely musical genre, and thus call their music 'black metal'.[336]

Blackened death-doom is a genre that combines the slow tempos and monolithic drumming of doom metal, the complex and loud riffage of death metal and the shrieking vocals of black metal.[220] Examples of blackened death-doom bands include Morast,[220] Faustcoven,[220] The Ruins of Beverast,[220] Bölzer,[220] Necros Christos,[220] Harvest Gulgaltha,[221] Dragged into Sunlight,[222] Hands of Thieves,[223] and Soulburn.[224][225]
The conventional history of black metal is that pioneers like Venom, Bathory, and Hellhammer were part of a "first wave", and that a "second wave" was begun by the early Norwegian scene, especially by Mayhem vocalist Dead;[50] Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide;[51] and Darkthrone's album A Blaze in the Northern Sky.[52][53][54] There are also some who argue that albums like Sarcófago's I.N.R.I.[55] or Samael's Worship Him[56] began the second wave.
Post-black metal is an umbrella term for genres that experiment beyond black metal's conventions and broaden their sounds, evolving past the genre's limits.[272] Notable bands include Myrkur,[273] Alcest,[274] Bosse-de-Nage,[275] and Wildernessking.[276]

The cartoon show Metalocalypse is about an extreme metal band called Dethklok, with many references to leading black metal artists on the names of various businesses, such as Fintroll's convenience store, Dimmu Burger, Gorgoroth's electric wheelchair store, Carpathian Forest High School, Marduk's Putt & Stuff, Burzum's hot-dogs and Behemoth studios (the man who owns Behemoth studios is also named Mr. Grishnackh). In the episode "Dethdad", Dethklok travels to Norway to both visit Toki's dying father and the original black metal record store, much to the dismay of the band members when they find out the store does not sell any of their music, described by the owner as being "too digital".

In the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as Alan 'Nemtheanga' Averill says, "you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound, and there was German bands and Swiss bands and that kind of thing."[6] By the mid-1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, Kerrang! journalist Malcolm Dome said that "black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country".[101] Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as synthesizers and even full-symphony orchestras. By the late 1990s, the underground concluded that several of the Norwegian pioneers—like Emperor,[78][133] Immortal,[78][133] Dimmu Borgir,[133] Ancient,[78][133] Covenant/The Kovenant,[133] and Satyricon[78]—had commercialized[78][133] or sold out to the mainstream and "big bastard labels."[133] Dayal Patterson states that successful acts like Dimmu Borgir "provoked and even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground" regarding the view that these bands had "sold out."[125]

Campion, Chris (20 February 2005). "In the face of death". The Guardian. London. Retrieved 30 December 2018. 'Øystein was always sending death threats to people,' says Necro Butcher. 'It was his reaction to everything. But he didn't put so much into it. And then when he met you, he was like, "OK. You're cool!". Then you were best friends. So when eventually he got to be unfriendly with Varg, he threatened him like he did everyone else. Øystein told him, "I'm going to send some people to torture you. Until you die." But Varg Vikernes saw this as a real threat. He probably thought, "better him than me. I'll just go down and do him".'
Black metal tends to be misanthropic and hostile to modern society.[39] It is "a reaction against the mundanity, insincerity and emotional emptiness that participants feel is intrinsic to modern secular culture".[299] The black metal scene tends to oppose political correctness, humanitarianism, consumerism, globalization and homogeneity.[300][301][302] Aaron Weaver from Wolves in the Throne Room said: "I think that black metal is an artistic movement that is critiquing modernity on a fundamental level, saying that the modern world view is missing something".[303] As part of this, some parts of the scene glorify nature and have a fascination with the distant past.[304][305] Black metal has been likened to Romanticism and there is an undercurrent of romantic nationalism in the genre.[306][307] Sam Dunn noted that "unlike any other heavy metal scene, the culture and the place is incorporated into the music and imagery".[16] Individualism is also an important part of black metal,[16] with Fenriz of Darkthrone describing black metal as "individualism above all".[308] Unlike other kinds of metal, black metal has numerous one-man bands. However, it is argued that followers of Euronymous were anti-individualistic,[309] and that "Black Metal is characterized by a conflict between radical individualism and group identity and by an attempt to accept both polarities simultaneously".[304]

In 1990 and 1991, Northern European metal acts began to release music influenced by these bands or the older ones from the first wave. In Sweden, this included Marduk, Dissection, Nifelheim and Abruptum. In Finland, there emerged a scene that mixed the first wave black metal style with elements of death metal and grindcore; this included Beherit, Archgoat and Impaled Nazarene, whose debut album Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz Rock Hard journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann considers a part of war metal's roots.[81] Bands such as Demoncy and Profanatica emerged during this time in the United States, when death metal was more popular among extreme metal fans. The Norwegian band Mayhem's concert in Leipzig with Eminenz and Manos in 1990, later released as Live in Leipzig, was said to have had a strong influence on the East German scene[82] and is even called the unofficial beginning of German black metal.[83]

Hellhammer, from Switzerland, "made truly raw and brutal music"[61] with Satanic lyrics, and became an important influence on later black metal;[62] "Their simple yet effective riffs and fast guitar sound were groundbreaking, anticipating the later trademark sound of early Swedish death metal".[61] In 1984, members of Hellhammer formed Celtic Frost,[63] whose music "explored more orchestral and experimental territories. The lyrics also became more personal, with topics about inner feelings and majestic stories. But for a couple of years, Celtic Frost was one of the world's most extreme and original metal bands, with a huge impact on the mid-1990s black metal scene".[61]

Although contemporary black metal typically refers to the Norwegian style with shrieking vocals and raw production, the term has traditionally been applied to bands with widely differing sounds, such as Death SS, Mercyful Fate, Mayhem, Blasphemy,[6][27] and the Greek and Finnish bands that emerged around the same time as the Norwegian scene.[6]
Symphonic black metal is a style of black metal that incorporates symphonic and orchestral elements. This may include the usage of instruments found in symphony orchestras (piano, violin, cello, flute and keyboards), "clean" or operatic vocals and guitars with less distortion.[294]

In France, besides Les Légions Noires (The Black Legions), an NSBM scene arose. Members of French band Funeral desecrated a grave in Toulon in June 1996, and a 19-year-old black metal fan stabbed a priest to death in Mulhouse on Christmas Eve 1996.[152] According to MkM of Antaeus and Aosoth, the early French scene "was quite easy to divide: either you were NSBM, and you had the support from zine and the audience, or you were part of the black legions, and you had that 'cult' aura", whereas his band Antaeus, not belonging to either of these sub-scenes, "did not fit anywhere."[153] Many French bands, like Deathspell Omega and Aosoth, have an avantgarde approach[154] and a disharmonic sound that is representative of that scene.[155]

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993, in Bergen.[116] Many other members of the scene were taken in for questioning around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for possession of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".[104] Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read and the picture was widely reprinted in the news media. Blackthorn was sentenced to eight years in prison for being an accomplice to the murder.[104] That month saw the release of Mayhem's album De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, which featured Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.[29] Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes, but Hellhammer said: "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts. But I never did".[29] In 2003, Vikernes failed to return to Tønsberg prison after being given a short leave. He was re-arrested shortly after while driving a stolen car with various weapons.[117] Vikernes was released on parole in 2009.[118][119]

While some black metal fans boycott Neo-Nazi artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians,[151] but overall Neo-Nazism has been criticized by some prominent and influential black metal artists—including Jon Nödtveidt,[137] Gorgoroth,[348][24][25] Dark Funeral,[6][349] Richard Lederer,[350] Michael Ford,[351] and Arkhon Infaustus.[6] Some liken Nazism to Christianity by arguing that both are authoritarian, collectivist, and a "herd mentality".[137][348] Olson writes that the shunning of Nazism by some black-metallers "has nothing to do with notions of a 'universal humanity' or a rejection of hate" but that Nazism is shunned "because its hatred is too specific and exclusive".[352]

Black metal songs often stray from conventional song structure and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections. The Greek style—established by Rotting Christ, Necromantia and Varathron[34]—has more traditional heavy metal[9] and death metal[10] traits than Norwegian black metal.

Black metal artists often appear dressed in black with combat boots, bullet belts, spiked wristbands[39] and inverted crosses and inverted pentagrams to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.[16] However, the most stand-out trait is their use of corpse paint—black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance.

Melodic black-death[235] (also known as blackened melodic death metal or melodic blackened death metal)[236] is a genre of extreme metal that describes the style created when melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre incorporated an increased sense of melody and narrative.[236] Some bands who have played this style include Dissection,[236][235][237] Sacramentum,[236][235] Naglfar,[236] God Dethroned,[238] Dawn,[236] Unanimated,[236] Thulcandra,[235][236] Skeletonwitch[239] and Cardinal Sin.[235]
In his master's thesis, Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that some artists can be seen as transcendentalists. Dissatisfied with a "world that they feel is devoid of spiritual and cultural significance",[310] they try to leave or "transcend" their "mundane physical forms" and become one with the divine.[311] This is done through their concerts, which he describes as "musical rituals" that involve self-mortification and taking on an alternative, "spiritual persona" (for example by the wearing of costume and face paint).[312]

According to Erik Danielsson, when his band Watain formed in 1998, there were very few bands who took black metal as seriously as the early Norwegian scene had.[109] A newer generation of Swedish Satanic bands like Watain and Ondskapt, inspired by Ofermod,[140][141] the new band of Nefandus member Belfagor, put this scene "into a new light." Kvarforth said, "It seems like people actually [got] afraid again."[109] "The current Swedish black metal scene has a particularly ambitious and articulate understanding of mysticism and its validity to black metal. Many Swedish black metal bands, most notably Watain and Dissection, are [or were] affiliated with the Temple of the Black Light, or Misanthropic Luciferian Order […] a Theistic, Gnostic, Satanic organization based in Sweden".[142] Upon his release in 2004, Jon Nödtveidt restarted Dissection with new members whom he felt were able to "stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept."[143] He started calling Dissection "the sonic propaganda unit of the MLO"[144][145] and released a third full-length album, Reinkaos. The lyrics contain magical formulae from the Liber Azerate and are based on the organization's teachings.[146] After the album's release and a few concerts, Nödtveidt said that he had "reached the limitations of music as a tool for expressing what I want to express, for myself and the handful of others that I care about" and disbanded Dissection[145] before dying by suicide.[147]

During the 1980s, several thrash metal and death metal bands formed a prototype for black metal.[2] This "first wave" included bands such as Venom, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost.[16] A second wave arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon and Gorgoroth. The early Norwegian black metal scene developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently. Some prominent Swedish bands spawned during this second wave, the second generation in Sweden being led by Dissection,[17] Abruptum,[17][18] Marduk,[17][19][20] and Nifelheim.[17]
Blackened grindcore is a fusion genre that combines elements of black metal and grindcore.[242][243]Notable bands include Anaal Nathrakh and early Rotting Christ.[244]
National Socialist black metal (also known as NSBM) is a subgenre that promotes neo-Nazi or similar beliefs through its lyrics and imagery. Artists typically meld neo-Nazi ideology with ethnic European paganism, but a few meld these beliefs with Satanism or occultism. Some commentators see this ideology as a natural development of the black metal worldview. Members of the early Norwegian scene flirted with Nazi themes, but this was largely an attempt to provoke.[283] Varg Vikernes—who now refers to his ideology as 'Odalism'[284]—is credited with popularizing such views within the scene.[285][286] NSBM emerged in the mid-1990s and was spearheaded by artists such as Absurd (from Germany), Graveland, Infernum, and Veles (from Poland), and Grand Belial's Key (from the US). It is particularly strong in the former Eastern Bloc.

Blackened death metal is commonly death metal that incorporates musical, lyrical or ideological elements of black metal, such as an increased use of tremolo picking, anti-Christian or Satanic lyrical themes and chord progressions similar to those used in black metal.[226][227][228] Blackened death metal bands are also more likely to wear corpse paint and suits of armour, than bands from other styles of death metal.[229] Lower range guitar tunings, death growls and abrupt tempo changes are common in the genre.[230] Examples of blackened death metal bands are Belphegor,[231] Behemoth,[232] Akercocke,[233] and Sacramentum.[234]

The controversy surrounding the Thuringian band Absurd drew attention to the German black metal scene. In 1993, the members murdered a boy from their school, Sandro Beyer.[126] A photo of Beyer's gravestone is on the cover of one of their demos,[127] Thuringian Pagan Madness, along with pro-Nazi statements. It was recorded in prison and released in Poland by Graveland drummer Capricornus.[128] The band's early music was more influenced by Oi! and Rock Against Communism (RAC) than by black metal,[129] and described as being "more akin to '60s garage punk than some of the […] Black Metal of their contemporaries".[130] Alexander von Meilenwald from German band Nagelfar considers Ungod's 1993 debut Circle of the Seven Infernal Pacts, Desaster's 1994 demo Lost in the Ages, Tha-Norr's 1995 album Wolfenzeitalter, Lunar Aurora's 1996 debut Weltengänger and Katharsis's 2000 debut 666[131] to be the most important recordings for the German scene.[82] He said they were "not necessarily the best German releases, but they all kicked off something".[82]
Blackened thrash metal, also known as black-thrash,[245] is a fusion genre that combines elements of black metal and thrash metal.[245][246] Being considered one of the first fusions of extreme metal,[245] it was inspired by bands such as Venom, Sodom, and Sarcófago.[247] Notable bands include Aura Noir,[248] Witchery,[249][250] Black Fast,[251] Sathanas,[252] and Deströyer 666.[246]

Blackgaze incorporates common black metal and post-black metal elements such as blast beat drumming and high-pitched screamed vocals with the melodic and heavily distorted guitar styles typically associated with shoegazing.[277][278] It is associated with bands such as Deafheaven,[279] Alcest,[280] Vaura,[278] Amesoeurs,[281] Bosse-de-Nage,[278] Oathbreaker,[282] and Fen.[278]
The wearing of corpse paint became standard, and was a way for many black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era.[39] The scene also had an ideology and ethos. Artists were bitterly opposed to Christianity and presented themselves as misanthropic Devil worshippers who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil.[87] They professed to be serious in their views and vowed to act on them. Ihsahn of Emperor said that they sought to "create fear among people"[88] and "be in opposition to society".[89] The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those who were "true" and attempting to expel all "poseurs".[26] Some members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murder, which eventually drew attention to it and led to a number of artists being imprisoned.

Norwegian-inspired black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched or trebly guitar tones and heavy distortion.[28] The guitar is usually played with fast, un-muted tremolo picking and power chords.[28][29][30] Guitarists often use dissonance—along with specific scales, intervals and chord progressions—to create a sense of dread. The tritone, or flat-fifth, is often used. Guitar solos and low guitar tunings are rare in black metal.[30] The bass guitar is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is common for the bass to be muted against the guitar,[30] or for it to homophonically follow the low-pitched riffs of the guitar. While electronic keyboards are not a standard instrument, some bands, like Dimmu Borgir, use keyboards "in the background" or as "proper instruments" for creating atmosphere.[31] Some newer black metal bands began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as synthesizers and even orchestras.

During May–June 1991,[100] Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named "Helvete" (Norwegian for "Hell") at Schweigaards gate 56 in Oslo. It quickly became the focal point of Norway's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians; especially the members of Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns.[101] Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen, writer of the fanzine Slayer, said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian black metal scene".[51] In its basement, Euronymous founded an independent record label named Deathlike Silence Productions. With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.

Industrial black metal is a style of black metal that incorporates elements of industrial music. Mysticum, formed in 1991,[262] was the first of these groups.[263] DHG (Dødheimsgard), Thorns from Norway and Blut Aus Nord, N.K.V.D. and Blacklodge from France, have been acclaimed for their incorporation of industrial elements.[264] Other industrial black metal musicians include Samael,[265] The Axis of Perdition,[266] Aborym,[267] and ...And Oceans.[268] In addition, The Kovenant,[269] Mortiis and Ulver emerged from the Norwegian black metal scene, but later chose to experiment with industrial music.[270][271]

Loputon Gehennan Liekki (Eternal Flame of Gehenna)(2011) Finnish black metal documentary
In Australia, a scene led by bands like Deströyer 666, Vomitor, Hobbs' Angel of Death, Nocturnal Graves and Gospel of the Horns arose. This scene's typical style is a mixture of old school black metal and raw thrash metal influenced by old Celtic Frost, Bathory, Venom, and Sodom but also with its own elements.[167]
Since the 1990s, different styles of black metal have emerged and some have melded Norwegian-style black metal with other genres:
In the late 1970s, the form of rough and aggressive heavy metal played by the British band Motörhead gained popularity.[57] Many first wave black metal bands cited Motörhead as an influence.[57] Also popular in the late 1970s, punk rock came to influence the birth of black metal.[57] Tom G. Warrior of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost credited English punk group Discharge as "a revolution, much like Venom", saying, "When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far."[58]

Pioneered by black-doom bands like Ophthalamia, Katatonia, Bethlehem, Forgotten Tomb and Shining, depressive suicidal black metal, also known as suicidal black metal, depressive black metal or DSBM, is a style that melds the second wave-style of black metal with doom metal,[190] with lyrics revolving around themes such as depression, self-harm, misanthropy, suicide and death.[44][45] DSBM bands draws the lo-fi recording and highly distorted guitars of black metal, while employing the usage of acoustic instruments and non-distorted electric guitar's timbres present in doom metal, interchanging the slower, doom-like, sections with faster tremolo picking.[190] Vocals are usually high-pitched like in black metal, but lacking of energy, simulating feelings like hopelessness, desperation and plea.[190] The presence of one-man bands is more prominent in this genre compared to others.[190] Examples of bands include Xasthur,[191] Leviathan,[190] Strid,[190] Silencer,[44][45] Make a Change… Kill Yourself,[190] Lifelover[192] and I Shalt Become.[44][45]

In 1987, in the fifth issue of his Slayer fanzine, Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen wrote that "the latest fad of black/Satanic bands seems to be over",[68] the tradition being continued by a few bands like Incubus[68] and Morbid Angel[68] (from the United States), Sabbat (from Great Britain),[68] Tormentor (from Hungary), Sarcófago (from Brazil), Grotesque,[69][70] Treblinka[70][71] and early Tiamat[69][72] (from Sweden). Other early black metal bands include Sabbat (formed 1983 in Japan),[73] Parabellum (formed 1983 in Colombia),[74] Salem (formed 1985 in Israel) and Mortuary Drape (formed 1986 in Italy).[75] Japanese band Sigh formed in 1990 and was in regular contact with key members of the Norwegian scene. Their debut album, Scorn Defeat, became "a cult classic in the black metal world".[76] In the years before the Norwegian black metal scene arose, important recordings were released by Root and Master's Hammer (from Czechoslovakia), Von (from the United States), Rotting Christ (from Greece), Samael (from Switzerland) and Blasphemy (from Canada), whose debut album Fallen Angel of Doom (1990) is considered one of the most influential records for the war metal style.[77][78][79] Fenriz of the Norwegian band Darkthrone called Master's Hammer's debut album Ritual "the first Norwegian black metal album, even though they are from Czechoslovakia".[80]

Comedian Brian Posehn made a visual reference to Norwegian black metal bands in the music video for his comedy song "Metal by Numbers".[360]
Others shun Satanism, seeing it as Christian or "Judeo-Christian" in origin,[325][326] and regard Satanists as perpetuating the "Judeo-Christian" worldview.[327] Quorthon of Bathory said he used 'Satan' to provoke and attack Christianity. However, with his third and fourth albums, Under the Sign of the Black Mark and Blood Fire Death, he began "attacking Christianity from a different angle", realizing that Satanism is a "Christian product".[326] Nevertheless, some artists use Satan as a symbol or metaphor for their beliefs, such as LaVeyan Satanists (who are atheist). Vocalist Gaahl, who considers himself a Norse Shaman,[328] said: "We use the word 'Satanist' because it is Christian world and we have to speak their language ... When I use the word 'Satan', it means the natural order, the will of a man, the will to grow, the will to become the superman".[329] Varg Vikernes called himself a Satanist in early interviews but "now downplays his former interest in Satanism", saying he was using Satan as a symbol for Odin as the 'adversary' of the Christian God.[330] He saw Satanism as "an introduction to more indigenous heathen beliefs".[331] Some bands such as Carach Angren,[332] Immortal[333] and Enslaved[334][335] do not have Satanic lyrics.

On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist Per "Dead" Ohlin committed suicide while left alone in a house shared by the band.[90][91] Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted and depressed. Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, said that Dead was the first to wear the distinctive corpse paint that became widespread in the scene.[92] He was found with slit wrists and a shotgun wound to the head. Dead's suicide note began with "Excuse all the blood", and apologized for firing the weapon indoors.[91][93] Before calling the police, Euronymous got a disposable camera and photographed the body,[94] after re-arranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album, Dawn of the Black Hearts.[92]

Another major influence on black metal was the Swedish band Bathory. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. Quorthon), created "the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal".[60] Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that later became a common trait.[36] The band played in this style on their first four albums: Bathory (1984), The Return…… (1985), Under the Sign of the Black Mark (1987) and Blood Fire Death (1988). With Blood Fire Death and the two following albums, Bathory pioneered the style that became known as Viking metal.

The Danish band Mercyful Fate influenced the Norwegian scene with their imagery and lyrics.[64] Frontman King Diamond, who wore ghoulish black-and-white facepaint on stage, may be one of the inspirators of what became known as 'corpse paint'. Other acts which adopted a similar appearance on stage were the horror punk band Misfits, Celtic Frost and the Brazilian extreme metal band Sarcófago.[65] Other artists usually considered part of this movement include Kreator, Sodom and Destruction (from Germany),[66] Bulldozer and Death SS (from Italy),[27] whose vocalist Steve Sylvester was a member of the Ordo Templi Orientis.[67]

The term "black metal" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album Black Metal (1982). Although generally deemed speed metal or thrash metal rather than black metal,[39] the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that became widespread among black metal musicians.
666 – At Calling Death (1993) was a documentary released by Nuclear Blast, which provides an abundance of interviews and perspectives on the meaning of both death and black metal genres from musicians who perform these styles, in light of the Norwegian scene church burnings and murders, which had been occurring around that time. The latter half of the documentary focuses on black metal.

Initially a synonym for "Satanic metal",[21] black metal has often sparked controversy, due to the actions and ideologies associated with the genre. Some artists express misanthropic views, and others advocate various forms of extreme anti-Christian sentiment, Satanism, or ethnic paganism. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murders.[22][23] There is also a small neo-Nazi movement within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists.[6][24][25] Generally, black metal strives to remain an underground phenomenon.[26]

The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During 1990–1993, a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon, Enslaved, Thorns, and Gorgoroth. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch and Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth.[6][29] Fenriz of Darkthrone described it as being "derived from Bathory"[85] and noted that "those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s".[86]
Folk black metal, pagan metal and Viking metal are styles that incorporates elements of folk music, with pagan metal bands focusing on pagan lyrics and imagery,[253] and Viking metal bands giving thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age, more influenced by Nordic folk music.[254] While not focused on Satanism, the bands' use of ancient folklore and mythologies still express anti-Christian views, with folk black metal doing it as part of a "rebellion to the status quo", that developed concurrently along with the rise of folk metal in Europe in the 1990s,[255][253] Notable artist include Negură Bunget,[255] Windir,[256] Primordial,[257][258] In the Woods...,[259] Cruachan,[260] and Bathory, to whose albums Blood Fire Death (1988) and Hammerheart (1990) the origin of Viking metal can be traced.[261]
There are many references to black/extreme metal bands (Bathory, Marduk, Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir) in Åke Edwardson's 1999 crime novel Sun and Shadow (Sol och skugga). The plot involves the music of a fictional Canadian black metal band called Sacrament. As part of the inquiry, Inspector Winter tries to distinguish between black and death metal artists.[361]

The imagery of black metal reflects its lyrics and ideology. In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring xeroxed black-and-white pictures and/or writing.[6] This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.[6] Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example Burzum's Filosofem and Emperor's In the Nightside Eclipse) while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example Marduk's Fuck Me Jesus and Dimmu Borgir's In Sorte Diaboli).

The earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings were often made in homes or basements,[28] giving their recordings a distinctive "lo-fi" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.[30][39] Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more "raw" or "cold".[39] A well-known example of this approach is on the album Transilvanian Hunger by Darkthrone, a band who Johnathan Selzer of Terrorizer magazine says "represent the DIY aspect of black metal."[39] In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are not committed. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience.[39] Vocalist Gaahl said that during its early years, "Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction".[29]
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.[110] On the night of 10 August 1993, Varg Vikernes (of Burzum) and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch (of Thorns) drove from Bergen to Euronymous's apartment in Oslo. When they arrived a confrontation began and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.[111]
Black metal was originally a term for extreme metal bands with Satanic lyrics and imagery. However, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and rather used Satanic themes to provoke controversy or gain attention. One of the few exceptions was Mercyful Fate singer and Church of Satan member King Diamond, whom Michael Moynihan calls "one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a poseur using a devilish image for shock value".[313]

Raw black metal is a subgenre that seeks to amplify the primitive qualities of the second wave of black metal, by giving priority to its lo-fi production values.[291][292] To achieve this, bands under this style usually emphasize the usage of higher-pitches in their guitar sound and vocals, while employing techniques such as tremolo picking and blast beats more often.[292] Its imagery is often associated with dystopic and minimalistic tendencies.[291][292] Notable bands include Gorgoroth[291] and Darkthrone.[293]
Director Sam Dunn Picks the Five Most Important Extreme-Metal Bands – Revolver Magazine (13 August 2013)
In the early 1990s, many Norwegian black-metallers presented themselves as genuine Devil worshippers.[314] Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this.[309] They attacked the Church of Satan for its "freedom and life-loving" views;[315] the theistic Satanism they espoused was an inversion of Christianity. Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that they "transform[ed] Venom's quasi-Satanic stage theatrics into a form of cultural expression unique from other forms of metal or Satanism" and "abandoned the mundane identities and ambitions of other forms of metal in favor of religious and ideological fanaticism".[309] Some prominent scene members—such as Euronymous and Faust[27][66]—stated that only bands who are Satanists can be called 'black metal'. Bands with a Norwegian style, but without Satanic lyrics, tended to use other names for their music.[259][297][298] This view is still held by many artists—such as Infernus,[316] Arioch,[317] Nornagest and Erik Danielsson.[318] Some bands, like the reformed Dissection[143][145] and Watain,[319] insist that all members must be of the same Satanic belief, whereas Michael Ford of Black Funeral[120] and MkM of Antaeus[320] believe black metal must be Satanic but not all band members need to be Satanists. Others—such as Jan Axel Blomberg,[321] Sigurd Wongraven[39] and Eric Horner[322]—believe that black metal does not need to be Satanic. An article in Metalion's Slayer fanzine attacked musicians that "care more about their guitars than the actual essence onto which the whole concept was and is based upon", and insisted that "the music itself doesn't come as the first priority".[323] Bands with a similar style but with Pagan lyrics tend to be referred to as 'Pagan Metal' by many 'purist' black-metallers.[324]

Traditional black metal bands tend to favor raspy, high-pitched vocals which include techniques such as shrieking, screaming, and snarling,[28][30] a vocal style influenced by Quorthon of Bathory.[36] Death growls, common in the death metal genre, are sometimes used, but less frequently than the characteristic black metal shriek.[37][38]

Black-doom, also known as blackened doom, is a style that combines the slowness and thicker, bassier sound of doom metal with the shrieking vocals and heavily distorted guitar sound of black metal.[43][180][181] Black-doom bands maintain the Satanic ideology associated with black metal, while melding it with moodier themes more related to doom metal, like depression, nihilism and nature.[43] They also use the slower pace of doom metal in order to emphasize the harsh atmosphere present in black metal.[182] Examples of black-doom bands include Barathrum,[183] Forgotten Tomb,[180] Woods of Ypres,[184] Deinonychus,[185] Shining,[186] Nortt,[187] Bethlehem,[188] early Katatonia,[189] Tiamat,[182] Dolorian,[182] and October Tide.[182]

A part of the underground scene adopted a Jungian interpretation of the church burnings and other acts of the early scene as the re-emergence of ancient archetypes, which Kadmon of Allerseelen and the authors of Lords of Chaos had implied in their writings.[148][52] They mixed this interpretation with Paganism and Nationalism.[52] Varg Vikernes was seen as "an ideological messiah" by some,[149] although Vikernes had disassociated himself from black metal[149][150] and his neo-Nazism had nothing to do with that subculture.[150] This led to the rise of National Socialist black metal (NSBM), which Hendrik Möbus of Absurd calls "the logical conclusion" of the Norwegian black metal "movement".[52] Other parts of the scene oppose NSBM as it is "indelibly linked with Asá Trŭ and opposed to Satanism", or look upon Nazism "with vague skepticism and indifference".[151] Members of the NSBM scene, among others, see the Norwegian bands as poseurs whose "ideology is cheap", although they still respect Vikernes and Burzum, whom Grand Belial's Key vocalist Richard Mills called "the only Norwegian band that remains unapologetic and literally convicted of his beliefs."[149]

The early American black metal bands remained underground. Some of them—like Grand Belial's Key and Judas Iscariot—joined an international NSBM organization called the Pagan Front, although Judas Iscariot's sole member Akhenaten left the organization.[156] Other bands like Averse Sefira never had any link with Nazism.[156] The US bands have no common style. Many were musically inspired by Burzum but did not necessarily adopt Vikernes's ideas.[156] Profanatica's music is close to death metal,[157] while Demoncy were accused of ripping off Gorgoroth riffs.[158] There also emerged bands like Xasthur and Leviathan[47] (whose music is inspired by Burzum[156] and whose lyrics focus on topics such as depression and suicide),[159][160] Nachtmystium,[47] Krallice,[47][161] Wolves in the Throne Room[47][161] (a band linked to the crust punk scene and the environmental movement),[162][163] and Liturgy (the style of whom frontwoman Hunter Hunt-Hendrix describes as 'transcendental black metal').[47][164] These bands eschew black metal's traditional lyrical content for "something more Whitman-esque"[47] and have been rejected by some traditional black-metallers for their ideologies[165] and the post-rock and shoegazing influences some of them have adopted.[161] Also, some bands like Agalloch started to incorporate "doom and folk elements into the traditional blast-beat and tremolo-picking of the Scandinavian incarnation", a style that later became known as Cascadian black metal, in reference to the region where it emerged.[166]

Regarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre: "those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements".[39] The former believe that the music should always be minimalist—performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a low fidelity style. One supporter of this train of thought is Blake Judd of Nachtmystium, who has rejected labeling his band black metal for its departure from the genre's typical sound.[176] Snorre Ruch of Thorns, on the other hand, has said that modern black metal is "too narrow" and believes that this was "not the idea at the beginning".[177]

Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style,[13][14][15] heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.

Black metal lyrics typically attack Christianity and the other institutional religions,[30] often using apocalyptic language. Satanic lyrics are common,[39] and many see them as essential to black metal. For Satanist black metal artists, "Black metal songs are meant to be like Calvinist sermons; deadly serious attempts to unite the true believers".[40] Misanthropy, global catastrophe, war, death, destruction and rebirth are also common themes.[39] Another topic often found in black metal lyrics is that of the wild and extreme aspects and phenomena of the natural world, particularly the wilderness, forests, mountains, winter, storms, and blizzards.[41] Black metal also has a fascination with the distant past. Many bands write about the mythology and folklore[42] of their homelands and promote a revival of pre-Christian, pagan traditions. A significant number of bands write lyrics only in their native language and a few (e.g. Arckanum and early Ulver) have lyrics in archaic languages. Some doom metal-influenced artists' lyrics focus on depression, nihilism, introspection, self-harm and suicide.[43][44][45]

Unlike other metal genres, black metal is associated with an ideology and ethos. It is fiercely opposed to Christianity[16] and the other main institutional religions, Islam and Judaism. Many black metal bands are Satanists and see Satanism as a key part of black metal. Others advocate ethnic Paganism, "often coupled with nationalism",[296] although the early Pagan bands did not call themselves 'black metal'.[259][297][298]

The drumming is usually fast and relies on double-bass and blast beats to maintain tempos that can sometimes approach 300 beats per minute. These fast tempos require great skill and physical stamina, typified by black metal drummers Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) and Hellhammer (Jan Axel Blomberg).[32] Even still, authenticity is still prioritized over technique. "This professionalism has to go," insists well-respected drummer and metal historian Fenriz (Gylve Fenris Nagell) of Darkthrone. "I want to de-learn playing drums, I want to play primitive and simple, I don't want to play like a drum solo all the time and make these complicated riffs".[33]

After Euronymous's death, "some bands went more towards the Viking metal and epic style, while some bands went deeper into the abyss."[109] Since 1993, the Swedish scene had carried out church burnings, grave desecration, and other violent acts. In 1995, Jon Nödtveidt of Dissection joined the Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO).[134] In 1997, he and another MLO member were arrested and charged with shooting dead a 37-year-old man. It was said he was killed "out of anger" because he had "harassed" the two men. Nödtveidt received a 10-year sentence.[135] As the victim was a homosexual immigrant, Dissection was accused of being a Nazi band,[136] but Nödtveidt denied this and dismissed racism and nationalism.[136][137]

Crust punk groups, such as Antisect, Sacrilege and Anti System took some influence from early black metal bands like Venom, Hellhammer, and Celtic Frost,[204] while Amebix's lead vocalist and guitarist sent his band's early demo tape to Cronos of Venom, who replied by saying "We'll rip you off."[205] Similarly, Bathory was initially inspired by crust punk as well as heavy metal.[206] Crust punk was affected by a second wave of black metal in the 1990s, with some bands emphasizing these black metal elements. Iskra are probably the most obvious example of second wave black metal-influenced crust punk;[207] Iskra coined their own phrase "blackened crust" to describe their new style. The Japanese group Gallhammer also fused crust punk with black metal[208] while the English band Fukpig has been said to have elements of crust punk, black metal, and grindcore.[209][210] North Carolina's Young and in the Way have been playing blackened crust since their formation in 2009.[211] In addition, Norwegian band Darkthrone have incorporated crust punk traits in their more recent material.

In a very ironic paradox, black metal and crust punk have recently started to embrace one another. Members of Darkthrone and Satyricon have lately claimed that they love punk, while among crusties, black metal is the latest fashion. In fact, the latest album by crust punk band Skitsystem sounds very black metal—while the latest black metal opus by Darkthrone sounds very punk! This would have been unimaginable in the early 90s.[212]

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of either a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records or an attempt at outdoing a stabbing in Lillehammer the year before by Faust.[112] Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event.[85] He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him.[85][113] Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract that night and "tell him to fuck off", but that Euronymous panicked and attacked him first.[113] He also claims that most of the cuts were from broken glass Euronymous had fallen on during the struggle.[113] The self-defense story is doubted by Faust,[114] while Necrobutcher confirmed that Vikernes killed Euronymous in self-defense due to the death threats he received from him.[115]

Black metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early 1990s, inspired by the Norwegian scene or the older bands, or both. In Poland, a scene was spearheaded by Graveland and Behemoth. In France, a close-knit group of musicians known as Les Légions Noires emerged; this included artists such as Mütiilation, Vlad Tepes, Belketre and Torgeist. In Belgium, there were acts such as Ancient Rites and Enthroned. Bands such as Black Funeral, Grand Belial's Key and Judas Iscariot emerged during this time in the United States. Black Funeral, from Houston, formed in 1993, was associated with black magic and Satanism.[120]

The Swedish band Shining, founded in 1996, began writing music almost exclusively about depression and suicide, musically inspired by Strid and by Burzum's albums Hvis lyset tar oss and Filosofem.[138] Vocalist Niklas Kvarforth wanted to "force-feed" his listeners "with self-destructive and suicidal imagery and lyrics."[109] In the beginning, he used the term "suicidal black metal" for his music.[109][139] However, he stopped using the term in 2001 because it had begun to be used by a slew of other bands, whom he felt had misinterpreted his vision[109][139] and were using the music as a kind of therapy[109][139] rather than a weapon against the listener as Kvarforth intended.[139] He said that he "wouldn't call Shining a black metal band" and called the "suicidal black metal" term a "foolish idea."[109]

A notable black metal group in England was Cradle of Filth, who released three demos in a black/death metal style with symphonic flourishes, followed by the album The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, which featured a then-unusual hybrid style of black and gothic metal. The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal,[121] becoming one of the most successful extreme metal bands to date. John Serba of AllMusic commented that their first album "made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage".[122] Some black metal fans did not consider Cradle of Filth to be black metal. When asked if he considers Cradle of Filth a black metal band, vocalist Dani Filth said he considers them black metal in terms of philosophy and atmosphere, but not in other ways.[123] Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but "began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area" and "almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result".[124] Dayal Patterson says successful acts like Cradle of Filth "provoked an even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground" scene due to concerns about "selling out".[125]

Many bands choose not to play live.[46][47] Many of those who do play live maintain that their performances "are not for entertainment or spectacle. Sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else".[48] Some bands consider their concerts to be rituals[48] and often make use of stage props and theatrics. Bands such as Mayhem, Gorgoroth, and Watain are noted for their controversial shows, which have featured impaled animal heads, mock crucifixions, medieval weaponry and band members doused in animal blood.[49] A few vocalists, such as Dead, Maniac and Kvarforth, are known for cutting themselves while singing onstage.

Slayer is considered a thrash metal band.[145][146][7][147] In an article from December 1986 by the Washington Post, writer Joe Brown described Slayer as speed metal, a genre he defined as "an unholy hybrid of punk rock thrash and heavy metal that attracts an almost all-male teen-age following".[148] Describing Slayer's music, Brown wrote: "Over a jackhammer beat, Slayer's stun guitars created scraping sheets of corrosive metal noise, with occasional solos that sounded like squealing brakes, over which the singer-bassist emitted a larynx-lacerating growl-yowl."[148] In an article from September 1988 by the New York Times, writer Jon Pareles also described Slayer as speed metal, additionally writing that the band "brings the sensational imagery of tabloids and horror movies" and has lyrics that "revel in death, gore and allusions to Satanism and Nazism."[149] Pareles also described other "Big Four" thrash metal bands Metallica and Megadeth as speed metal bands.[149] Slayer's early works were praised for their "breakneck speed and instrumental prowess", combining the structure of hardcore punk tempos and speed metal. The band released fast, aggressive material.[7] The album Reign in Blood is the band's fastest, performed at an average of 220 beats per minute; the album Diabolus in Musica was the band's first to feature C♯ tuning; God Hates Us All was the first to feature drop B tuning and seven-string guitars tuned to B♭.[citation needed] AllMusic cited the album as "abandoning the extravagances and accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returning to perfect the raw approach",[150] with some fans labeling it as nu metal.[151]

The members of Slayer have expressed mixed opinions about a reunion. When asked by the Let There Be Talk podcast in June 2020 about the possibility of the band ever reforming, Holt stated, "If it does, if it ever happens, it has nothing to do with me. Someone else would call and say, 'We wanna [do this].' To my knowledge, it's done. And I think it should be that way. The band went out fucking on a bang, went out on Slayer's terms, and how many people get to say they did that?".[141] Holt stated in March 2021 that he was open to a potential Slayer reunion, but it was unlikely to happen in the near future: "Look, if the powers that be ever — like, in a year or something — said, 'Hey, you know what? We feel like playing some shows,' I'm there to do it. But those aren't decisions for me to make, or even me to really speculate on. As far as my knowledge, the band is over, and the final show was November 30, 2019. And I'm full speed ahead with Exodus now."[142] In October 2021, King expressed regret that Slayer had retired "too early." While congratulating Machine Head on their 30th anniversary as a band, he said, "Apparently, it's 30 years, which is quite an achievement. Not a lot of bands get there. We did, and then we quit too early. Fuck us. Fuck me. I hate fucking not playing."[143] When interviewed two months later by Metal Hammer, King did not rule out the possibility of any more "Big Four" shows with Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax, but expressed doubt that a Slayer reunion would ever happen: "The way that I'm moving forward is I don't think Slayer are ever going to play again. There's no business of me playing by myself!"[144] King's wife Ayesha has also ruled out the possibility of a Slayer reunion, saying that her husband and Araya will "never be Slayer again".[6]

On January 22, 2018, Slayer announced their farewell world tour through a video featuring a montage of press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning the band's entire career. Although the members of Slayer have never publicly explained why they were retiring from touring, it was thought that one of the reasons behind this decision was at the expense of Tom Araya's desire not to tour anymore and to spend more time with his family.[3] This was confirmed by former drummer Dave Lombardo in a 2019 interview, who said: "Apparently, from what I hear. Tom has been wanting to retire when I was in the band — he wanted to stop. He had the neck issues. He's been wanting to retire for a long time now. So now that he's got it, I'm happy for him, and I hope he gets what he wants out of life and his future."[114]
In early 2011, Hanneman was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. According to the band, doctors said that it likely originated from a spider bite. Araya said of Hanneman's condition: "Jeff was seriously ill. Jeff ended up contracting a bacteria that ate away his flesh on his arm, so they cut open his arm, from his wrist to his shoulder, and they did a skin graft on him, they cleaned up ... It was a flesh-eating virus, so he was really, really bad. So we'll wait for him to get better, and when he's a hundred percent, he's gonna come out and join us."[73] The band decided to play their upcoming tour dates without Hanneman.[74] Gary Holt of Exodus was announced as Hanneman's temporary replacement.[75] Cannibal Corpse guitarist Pat O'Brien filled in for Holt during a tour in Europe.[76] On April 23, 2011, at the American Big 4 show in Indio, California, Hanneman rejoined his bandmates to play the final two songs of their set, "South of Heaven" and "Angel of Death". This turned out to be Hanneman's final live performance with the band.[77]

Slayer geared up for a world tour in 1995, with openers Biohazard and Machine Head. A video of concert footage, Live Intrusion was released, featuring a joint cover of Venom's "Witching Hour" with Machine Head. Following the tour, Slayer was billed third at the 1995 Monsters of Rock festival, headlined by Metallica. In 1996, Undisputed Attitude, an album of punk covers, was released. The band covered songs by Minor Threat, T.S.O.L., Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, D.I., Verbal Abuse, Dr. Know, and The Stooges. The album featured three original tracks, "Gemini", "Can't Stand You", "Ddamm"; the latter two were written by Hanneman in 1984–1985 for a side project entitled Pap Smear. Bostaph left Slayer shortly after the album's recording to work on his own project, Truth About Seafood. With Bostaph's departure, Slayer recruited Testament drummer Jon Dette, and headlined the 1996 Ozzfest alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Danzig, Biohazard, Sepultura, and Fear Factory. Dette was fired after a year, due to a fallout with band members. After that, Bostaph returned to continue the tour.[31]

Diabolus in Musica (Latin for "The Devil in Music") was released in 1998, and debuted at number 31 on the Billboard 200, selling over 46,000 copies in its first week.[32] It was complete by September 1997, and scheduled to be released the following month, but got delayed by nine months after their label was taken over by Columbia Records.[33] The album received a mixed critical reception, and was criticized for adopting characteristics of nu metal music such as tuned down guitars, murky chord structures, and churning beats. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin described the album as "a feeble attempt at incorporating updated elements into the group's sound, the presence of which elevated the band's efforts somewhat and offered hope that Slayer could refrain from endlessly rehashing their previous material for their future output",[34] while Ben Ratliff of The New York Times had similar sentiments, writing on June 22, 1998 that: "Eight of the 11 songs on Diabolus in Musica, a few of which were played at the show, are in the same gray key, and the band's rhythmic ideas have a wearying sameness too."[35]

Music author Joel McIver considers Slayer very influential in the extreme metal scene, especially in the development of the death metal and black metal subgenres.[161] According to John Consterdine of Terrorizer, without "Slayer's influence, extreme metal as we know it wouldn't exist."[162] Kam Lee of Massacre and former member of Death stated: "there wouldn't be death metal or black metal or even extreme metal (the likes of what it is today) if not for Slayer."[163] Johan Reinholdz of Andromeda said that Slayer "were crucial in the development of thrash metal which then became the foundation for a lot of different subgenres. They inspired generations of metal bands."[163] Alex Skolnick of Testament declared: "Before Slayer, metal had never had such razor-sharp articulation, tightness, and balance between sound and stops. This all-out sonic assault was about the shock, the screams, the drums, and [...] most importantly the riffs."[164]

Slayer toured playing Reign in Blood in its entirety throughout the fall of 2003, under the tour banner "Still Reigning". Their playing of the final song, "Raining Blood", culminated with the band drenched in a rain of stage blood. Live footage of this was recorded at the Augusta Civic Center in Augusta, Maine, on July 11, 2004 and released on the 2004 DVD Still Reigning. The band also released War at the Warfield and a box set, Soundtrack to the Apocalypse featuring rarities, live CD and DVD performances and various Slayer merchandise. From 2002 to 2004, the band performed over 250 tour dates, headlining major music festivals including H82k2, Summer tour, Ozzfest 2004 and a European tour with Slipknot. While preparing for the Download Festival in England, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was taken to a hospital with an unknown and mysterious illness, and was unable to perform. Metallica vocalist James Hetfield searched for volunteers at the last minute to replace Ulrich; Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered, with Lombardo performing the songs "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen".[43]

The next studio album, Christ Illusion, was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, and would be the first album with original drummer Lombardo since 1990's Seasons in the Abyss.[44] However, the band decided to delay the release of the record, as they did not want to be among the many, according to King, "half-ass, stupid fucking loser bands" releasing records on June 6,[45] although USA Today reported the idea was thwarted because the band failed to secure sufficient studio recording time.[46] Slayer released Eternal Pyre on June 6 as a limited-edition EP. Eternal Pyre featured the song "Cult", a live performance of "War Ensemble" in Germany and video footage of the band recording "Cult". Five thousand copies were released and sold exclusively through Hot Topic chain stores, and sold out within hours of release.[47] On June 30, Nuclear Blast Records released a 7" vinyl picture disc version limited to a thousand copies.[48]

Slayer embarked on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US from October to December 1986, and Malice in Europe in April and May 1987. They also played with other bands such as Agnostic Front, Testament, Metal Church, D.R.I., Dark Angel and Flotsam and Jetsam.[17][22] The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but just one month into it, drummer Lombardo left the band: "I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid."[12] To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987.[12] At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" for the film Less than Zero.[12] Although the band was not happy with the final product, Hanneman deeming it "a poor representation of Slayer" and King labeling it "a hunk of shit", it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.[12]

In the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and King and Hanneman wrote the music with additional arrangement from Lombardo, and sometimes Araya. Araya formed a lyric writing partnership with Hanneman, which sometimes overshadowed the creative input of King.[12] Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music was a "free-for-all": "It's all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with Kerry – it's whoever's hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it's good, we use it; if not, we don't."[155]

In February 1984, King briefly joined Dave Mustaine's new band Megadeth.[13] Hanneman was worried about King's decision, stating in an interview, "I guess we're gonna get a new guitar player."[12] While Mustaine wanted King to stay on a permanent basis, King left after five shows, stating Mustaine's band was "taking too much of my time."[12] The split caused a rift between King and Mustaine, which evolved into a long running feud between the two bands.[14]

A worldwide tour dubbed The Unholy Alliance Tour, was undertaken to support the new record.

Show No Mercy had sold over 40,000 copies,[10] which led to the band returning to the studio to record their second full-length album. Metal Blade financed a recording budget, which allowed the band to hire producer Ron Fair.[12] Released in March 1985, Slayer's second full-length album, Hell Awaits, expanded on the darkness of Haunting the Chapel, with hell and Satan as common song subjects. The album was the band's most progressive offering, featuring longer and more complex song structures.[12] The intro of the title track is a backwards recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating "Join us", ending with "Welcome back" before the track begins. The album was a hit, with fans choosing Slayer for best band, best live band, Hell Awaits, as 1985's best album, and Dave Lombardo as best drummer in the British magazine Metal Forces' 1985 Readers Poll.[19]

In May 1992, Lombardo left the band due to conflicts with the other members, as well as his desire to be off tour for the birth of his first child.[27] Lombardo formed his own band Grip Inc., with Voodoocult guitarist Waldemar Sorychta,[28] and Slayer recruited former Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph to fill in the drummer position. Slayer made its debut appearance with Bostaph at the 1992 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington. Bostaph's first studio effort was a medley of three Exploited songs, "War", "UK '82", and "Disorder", with rapper Ice-T, for the Judgment Night movie soundtrack in 1993.[29]

Slayer is one of the most influential bands in heavy metal history. Steve Huey of AllMusic believes the musical style of Slayer makes the band stronger than the other members of the "Big Four" thrash metal bands Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax, all of which rose to fame during the 1980s.[7][156] Slayer's "downtuned rhythms, infectious guitar licks, graphically violent lyrics and grisly artwork set the standard for dozens of emerging thrash bands" and their "music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal" states MTV, ranking Slayer as the sixth "greatest metal band of all time",[157] ranking number 50 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.[158] Hanneman and King ranked number 10 in Guitar World's "100 greatest metal guitarists of all time" in 2004,[159] and were voted "Best Guitarist/Guitar Team" in Revolver's reader's poll. Original drummer Lombardo was also voted "Best Drummer" and the band entered the top five in the categories "Best Band Ever", "Best Live Band", "Album of the Year" (for Christ Illusion) and "Band of the Year".[160]
In June 1984, Slayer released a three-track EP called Haunting the Chapel. The EP featured a darker, more thrash-oriented style than Show No Mercy, and laid the groundwork for the future direction of the band.[15] The opening track, "Chemical Warfare", has become a live staple, played at nearly every show since 1984.[16]

Slayer's cover of Minor Threat's "Guilty of Being White" raised questions about a possible message of white supremacy in the band's music. The controversy surrounding the cover involved the changing of the refrain "guilty of being white" to "guilty of being right", at the song's ending. This incensed Minor Threat frontman Ian MacKaye, who stated "that is so offensive to me."[189] King said it was changed for "tongue-in-cheek" humor as he thought the allegation of racism at the time was "ridiculous".[190]

Def Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to the song "Angel of Death"[12] which detailed Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi physician Josef Mengele. The album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule.[12] Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the Billboard 200, peaking at number 94,[20] and the band's first album certified gold in the United States.[21]

Following the success of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a recording contract with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, a largely hip hop-based label.[12] The band accepted, and with an experienced producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in Blood, resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. The complex arrangements and long songs featured on Hell Awaits were ditched in favor of stripped down, hardcore punk influenced song structures.[12]

Reign in Blood, Lombardo's brief hiatus and South of Heaven (1986–1989)
Slayer was an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, drummer Dave Lombardo and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Slayer's final lineup comprised Araya, King, drummer Paul Bostaph (who replaced Lombardo in 1992 and again in 2013) and guitarist Gary Holt (who replaced Hanneman in 2011). Drummer Jon Dette was also a member of the band.
In 2008, Araya stated uncertainty about the future of the band,[61] and that he could not see himself continuing the career at a later age. He said that once the band finished its upcoming album, which was the final record in their contract, the band would sit down and discuss its future.[62] King was optimistic that the band would produce at least another two albums before considering to disband: "We're talking of going in the studio next February [2009] and getting the next record out so if we do things in a timely manner I don't see there's any reason why we can't have more than one album out."[63] Slayer, along with Trivium, Mastodon, and Amon Amarth, teamed up for a European tour titled 'The Unholy Alliance: Chapter III', throughout October and November 2008.[64][65] Slayer headlined the second Mayhem Festival in the summer of 2009. Slayer, along with Megadeth, also co-headlined Canadian Carnage, the first time they performed together in more than 15 years when they co-headlined four shows in Canada in late June 2009 with openers Machine Head and Suicide Silence.[66]

The song "Jihad" of the album Christ Illusion sparked controversy among families of the September 11 victims.[193] The song deals with the attack from the perspective of a religious terrorist.

In 1994, Slayer released Divine Intervention, the band's first album with Bostaph on the drums. The album featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which governments went to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much of the content of the lyrics.[11][30]

The album was the band's first to primarily feature dropped tuning, making use of the tritone interval referred to in the Middle Ages as the Devil's interval.[36] Slayer teamed up with digital hardcore group Atari Teenage Riot to record a song for the Spawn soundtrack titled "No Remorse (I Wanna Die)". The band paid tribute to Black Sabbath by recording a cover of "Hand of Doom" for the second of two tribute albums, titled Nativity in Black II. A world tour followed to support the new album, with Slayer making an appearance at the United Kingdom Ozzfest 1998.

In the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, torture, genocide, organized crime, secret societies, occultism, terrorism, religion or antireligion, fascism, racism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups. However, its music has been highly influential, being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.
Slayer returned to the studio in early 1990 with co-producer Andy Wallace to record its fifth studio album. Following the backlash created by South of Heaven, Slayer returned to the "pounding speed of Reign in Blood, while retaining their newfound melodic sense."[25] Seasons in the Abyss, released on October 9, 1990, was the first Slayer album to be released under Rubin's new Def American label, as he had parted ways with Def Jam owner Russell Simmons over creative differences. The album debuted at number 44 on the Billboard 200,[20] and was certified gold in 1992.[21] The album spawned Slayer's first music video for the album's title track, which was filmed in front of the Giza pyramids in Egypt.[26]

In late 1987, Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided to slow down the tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since."[12]

In November 2011, Lombardo posted a tweet that the band had started to write new music. This presumably meant that Hanneman's condition improved, and it was believed he was ready to enter the studio.[83] King had worked with Lombardo that year and they completed three songs. The band planned on entering the studio in either March or April 2012 and were hoping to have the album recorded before the group's US tour in late May and release it by the summer of that year.[84] However, King said the upcoming album would not be finished until September and October of that year, making a 2013 release likely.[85] In July 2012, King revealed two song titles for the upcoming album, "Chasing Death" and "Implode".[86]

Slayer released twelve studio albums, three live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. Slayer sold 5 million copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and over 20 million worldwide.[1][2] The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song "Eyes of the Insane" and one in 2008 for the song "Final Six", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). After more than three decades of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that it would embark on a farewell tour,[3] which took place from May 2018 to November 2019,[4] after which the band disbanded.[5][6]

In March 1985, Slayer began a national tour with Venom and Exodus, resulting in their first live home video dubbed Combat Tour: The Ultimate Revenge. The video featured live footage filmed at the Studio 54 club. The band then made its live European debut at the Heavy Sound Festival in Belgium opening for UFO.[18] Also in 1985, Slayer toured or played selected shows with bands like Megadeth, Destruction, D.R.I., Possessed, Agent Steel, S.O.D., Nasty Savage and Metal Church.[17]

On May 2, 2013, Hanneman died due to liver failure in a local hospital near his home in Southern California's Inland Empire;[91][92] the cause of death was later determined to be alcohol-related cirrhosis.[93] King confirmed that the band would continue, saying "Jeff is going to be in everybody's thoughts for a long time. It's unfortunate you can't keep unfortunate things from happening. But we're going to carry on – and he'll be there in spirit."[94] However, Araya felt more uncertain about the band's future, expressing his belief that "After 30 years [with Hanneman active in the band], it would literally be like starting over", and doubting that Slayer's fanbase would approve such a change.[95] Despite the uncertainty regarding the band's future, Slayer still worked on a followup to World Painted Blood. Additionally, it was reported that the new album would still feature material written by Hanneman.[96]
In February 2013, Lombardo was fired right before Slayer was to play at Australia's Soundwave festival due to an argument with band members over a pay dispute.[87] Slayer and American Recordings released a statement, saying "Mr. Lombardo came to the band less than a week before their scheduled departure for Australia to present an entirely new set of terms for his engagement that were contrary to those that had been previously agreed upon",[88] although Lombardo claimed there was a gag order in place.[87] Dette returned to fill in for Lombardo for the Soundwave dates.[89] It was confirmed that Lombardo was officially out of Slayer for the third time, and, in May, Bostaph rejoined the band.[90]

At the 2014 Revolver's Golden Gods Awards ceremony, Slayer debuted "Implode", its first new song in five years. The group announced that they had signed with Nuclear Blast, and planned to release a new album in 2015.[97] It was reported that Holt would take over Hanneman's guitar duties full-time,[98] although Holt did not participate in the songwriting.[99] In February, Slayer announced a seventeen date American tour to start in June featuring Suicidal Tendencies and Exodus.[100] In 2015, Slayer headlined the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival for the second time.[101] Repentless, the band's twelfth studio album, was released on September 11, 2015.[102] Slayer toured for two-and-a-half years in support of Repentless. The band toured Europe with Anthrax and Kvelertak in October and November 2015,[103] and embarked on three North American tours: one with Testament and Carcass in February and March 2016,[104] then with Anthrax and Death Angel in September and October 2016,[105] and with Lamb of God and Behemoth in July and August 2017.[106] A lone date in Southeast Asia in 2017 was held in the Philippines.[107]

In August 2016, guitarist Kerry King was asked if Slayer would release a follow-up to Repentless. He replied, "We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are way ahead of the ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." King also stated that Slayer was not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018.[108] In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he was "completely open" to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open."[109]

The band's eleventh studio album, World Painted Blood, was released by American Recordings. It was available on November 3 in North America and November 2 for the rest of the world. The band stated that the album takes elements of all their previous works including Seasons in the Abyss, South of Heaven, and Reign in Blood.[67] Slayer, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010 at Bemowo Airport, in Warsaw, Poland. One of the following Big 4 performances in (Sofia, Bulgaria, June 22, 2010) was sent via satellite in HD to cinemas.[68] They also went on to play several other dates as part of the Sonisphere Festival.

Slayer has been accused of holding Nazi sympathies, due to the band's eagle logo bearing resemblance to the Eagle atop swastika and the lyrics of "Angel of Death".[186] "Angel of Death" was inspired by the acts of Josef Mengele,[187] the doctor who conducted human experiments on prisoners during World War II at the Auschwitz concentration camp, and was dubbed the "Angel of Death" by inmates.[188]

In a June 2017 interview with the Ultimate Guitar Archive, Holt said that he was ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album.[110] When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded—some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [Laughs]"[111] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, "It depends on touring—getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time."[112] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'"[113]

The band's 1986 release Reign in Blood has been an influence to extreme and thrash metal bands since its release and is considered the record which set the bar for death metal.[176] It had a significant influence on the genre leaders such as Death, Obituary, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel and Napalm Death.[177] The album was hailed the "heaviest album of all time" by Kerrang!,[178] a "genre-definer" by Stylus,[179] and a "stone-cold classic upon its release" by AllMusic.[180] In 2006, Reign in Blood was named the best metal album of the last 20 years by Metal Hammer.[181] According to Nielsen SoundScan, Slayer sold 4,900,000 copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013.[182]

Slayer returned as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies, and Testament. During the sold out European leg of this tour, tickets had prices skyrocket to 1,000 Deutschmark (US$680) on the black market. With the popularity of American thrash at its peak, the band toured with Testament again in early 1991 and triple-headlined the North American version of the Clash of the Titans tour that summer with Megadeth, Anthrax, and opening act Alice in Chains.[17] The band released a double live album, Decade of Aggression in 1991, to celebrate ten years since their formation. The compilation debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200.[20]

In 1983, Slayer was invited to open for the band Bitch at the Woodstock Club in Anaheim, California to perform eight songs, six of which were covers. The band was spotted by Brian Slagel, a former music journalist who had recently founded Metal Blade Records. Impressed with Slayer, he met with the band backstage and asked them to record an original song for his upcoming Metal Massacre III compilation album. The band agreed and their song "Aggressive Perfector" created an underground buzz upon its release in mid 1983, which led to Slagel offering the band a recording contract with Metal Blade.[10]

In India, Christ Illusion was recalled by EMI India after protests with Christian religious groups due to the nature of the graphic artwork. The album cover was designed by Slayer's longtime collaborator Larry Carroll and features Christ in a "sea of despair", with amputated arms, missing an eye, while standing in a sea of blood with severed heads.[196] Joseph Dias of the Mumbai Christian group Catholic Secular Forum in India took "strong exception" to the original album artwork, and issued a memorandum to Mumbai's police commissioner in protest.[197] On October 11, 2006, EMI announced that all stocks had been destroyed, noting it had no plans to re-release the record in India in the future.[196]

Slayer was formed in 1981 by Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, Dave Lombardo, and Tom Araya in Huntington Park, California. The group started out playing covers of songs by bands such as Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom at parties and clubs in Southern California. The band's early image relied heavily on Satanic themes that featured pentagrams, make-up, spikes, and inverted crosses.[7] Rumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 film of the same name, were denied by King, as he later stated: "We never were; it's a myth to this day."[8] According to Lombardo, the original band name was to be Wings of Fire before they settled in with Slayer. It was he who designed the iconic logo. For inspiration, Lombardo thought in a perspective of a murderer of how they would carve out the logo with a knife and since he's lefthanded, the logo is unintentionally slanted to the right.[9]

During mid-2001, the band joined Morbid Angel, Pantera, Skrape and Static-X on the Extreme Steel Tour of North America, which was Pantera's last major tour.[37][38] After delays regarding remixing and artwork, including slip covers created to cover the original artwork as it was deemed "too graphic", Slayer's next album, God Hates Us All, was released on September 11, 2001. The band received its first Grammy nomination for the lead track "Disciple", although the Grammy was awarded to Tool, for "Schism".[39] The September 11 attacks on America jeopardized the 2001 European tour Tattoo the Planet originally set to feature Pantera, Static-X, Cradle of Filth, Biohazard and Vision of Disorder. The dates in the United Kingdom were postponed due to flight restrictions, with a majority of bands deciding to withdraw, leaving Slayer and Cradle of Filth remaining for the European leg of the tour.[40]

A lawsuit was brought against the band in 1996, by the parents of Elyse Pahler, who accused the band of encouraging their daughter's murderers through their lyrics.[183] Pahler was drugged, strangled, stabbed, trampled on, and raped as a sacrifice to the devil by three fans of the band.[183] The case was unsealed by the court on May 19, 2000, stating Slayer and related business markets distribute harmful products to teens, encouraging violent acts through their lyrics,[183] and "none of the vicious crimes committed against Elyse Marie Pahler would have occurred without the intentional marketing strategy of the death-metal band Slayer."[184] The lawsuit was dismissed in 2001, for multiple reasons including "principles of free speech, lack of a duty and lack of foreseeability."[185] A second lawsuit was filed by the parents, an amended complaint for damages against Slayer, their label, and other industry and label entities. The lawsuit was again dismissed. Judge E. Jeffrey Burke stated, "I do not consider Slayer's music obscene, indecent or harmful to minors."[185]

When writing material, the band would write the music first before incorporating lyrics. King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created, and to get their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band played the riff to get the basic song structure, and figured out where the lyrics and solos would be placed.[155]

Without any recording budget, the band had to self-finance its debut album. Combining the savings of Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist,[11] and money borrowed from King's father,[12] the band entered the studio in November 1983. The album was rushed into release, stocking shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. Show No Mercy, released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band. The group began a club tour of California to promote the album. The tour gave the band additional popularity and sales of Show No Mercy eventually reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.[10]

King and Hanneman's dual guitar solos have been referred to as "wildly chaotic",[7] and "twisted genius".[152] Original drummer Lombardo would use two bass drums (instead of a double pedal, which is used on a single bass drum). Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the "godfather of double bass" by Drummerworld.[153] Lombardo stated his reasons for using two bass drums: "When you hit the bass drum, the head is still resonating. When you hit it in the same place right after that, you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe." When playing the two bass drums, Lombardo would use the "heel-up" technique.[154]

Araya replied, "No. People thought we were serious!...back then you had that PMRC, who literally took everything to heart, when in actuality you're trying to create an image. You're trying to scare people on purpose."[191] Araya also denied rumors that Slayer members are Satanists, but they find the subject of Satanism interesting and "we are all on this planet to learn and experience."[192]

Pantera, Static-X, Vision of Disorder and Biohazard were replaced by other bands depending on location; Amorphis, In Flames, Moonspell, Children of Bodom, and Necrodeath. Biohazard eventually decided to rejoin the tour later on, and booked new gigs in the countries, where they missed a few dates. Drummer Bostaph left Slayer before Christmas in 2001, due to a chronic elbow injury, which would hinder his ability to play.[41] Since the band's European tour was unfinished at that time, the band's manager, Rick Sales, contacted original drummer Dave Lombardo and asked if he would like to finish the remainder of the tour.[42] Lombardo accepted the offer, and stayed as a permanent member.[41]

Wild Rags Records was a record label and store in Montebello, California. It was founded in the 1980s by Ricardo Campos. Though Wild Rags started out as a record store in East LA releasing cassettes from bands such as Cherry Street, the zine later distributed influential releases by the likes of Nuclear Death, Impetigo,[1] Brutality, Blood,[2] Sigh, Blasphemy, Necrophobic, Nuctemeron, Extreme Smoke, Crucifer and Internal Bleeding. Richard C would later concentrate on distributing Brazilian heavy metal and selling catalogues.
Throughout the years, Sadistic Intent has toured in various countries around the world such as Norway, Brazil, Finland, Mexico, Germany, Chile, Holland, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Greece, Belgium, Australia, Singapore, France and the US.
After the demise of Los Angeles, California's Devastation, which formed in 1986, Sadistic Intent began in 1987. The band quickly changed its line-up, then released a few rehearsal tapes and in early 1989 released the Conflict Within demo, which the band pushed and distributed through the international underground scene. Eventually Sadistic Intent signed with a rising label, Wild Rags Records. In 1990, the Impending Doom EP was released and a few tours followed in Mexico as well as the United States. The following year, after bitter disputes with the label, they moved on and self-released a limited edition (1,000 copies) 7-inch EP A Calm Before The Storm. Due to line-up problems, the band would not do any live appearances until 1993.

Eventually by 2007, Jeff Becerra asked Rick and Bay Cortez (the founding members of Sadistic Intent) if they would be interested in doing more Possessed songs and it was then when Becerra decided to call it Possessed, and Sadistic Intent became the members of that band from 2007 through 2010. After that split-up, in 2011 it was announced that drummer Nick Barker (Lock Up and Dimmu Borgir) had joined Sadistic Intent; however, logistically it became too difficult to take place. After taking care of that line-up change with the addition of current drummer Arthur Mendiola in 2011, the next Sadistic Intent release was recorded in 2013 and released in 2014 titled Reawakening Horrid Thoughts, a 12-inch laser-etched EP through Iron Pegasus Records.

In 1994, Sadistic Intent recorded the Resurrection MCD (released through Gothic Records, the re-press would then be done by Dark Realm Records in 1995) with bassist Bay Cortez singing for the first time. After sorting out another line-up problem in 1996, they recorded a tribute song to Celtic Frost for Dwell Records. In 1997, they then released Ancient Black Earth as a limited edition (500 hand-numbered copies) MCD through their own record label, Dark Realm Records. In 1998, a split 7-inch EP with the German black metal group Ungod was released through the German record label Merciless Records. 1999 saw more tribute recordings and releases from Sadistic Intent. One was for a Dwell Records tribute to Los Angeles metal band Slayer and the other for California's Possessed, which featured original Possessed front man Jeff Becerra on vocals. By 2000, Sadistic Intent licensed its Resurrection of the Ancient Black Earth LP to Germany's Iron Pegasus Records, which also released the Morbid Faith 7-inch EP in 2002.
Sadistic Intent is a death metal band from Los Angeles.

In 1995, former rhythm guitarist Mike Torrao joined a new death metal band, Infanticide, but never released any songs to the public. Infanticide broke up in 1997.He has since worked as a landscaper and plays music only in his spare time. As of 2008, Torrao is working with the band INaCAGE[51] in the San Francisco Bay Area.[49]

While Possessed's first album, Seven Churches, was praised for its speed and the brutality of the vocals, the second album, Beyond the Gates, disappointed both fans and critics alike. Released on Halloween of 1986, the album was not as powerful and as influential as its predecessor, and the band's popularity suffered because of it.[47][48]

Possessed spent 1983–1984 practicing and working on their sound by performing at local venues and becoming an active part of the Bay Area thrash scene. They recorded the 3-song demo Death Metal in 1984. After live shows with Metallica and Exodus, the latter group brought the band's demo recording to the attention of Brian Slagel, head of Metal Blade Records.[10][11] Slagel showed interest in the band and offered to put their song "Swing of the Axe" on the upcoming compilation Metal Massacre VI. Following the release of the compilation, guitarist Brian Montana left the band due to creative differences and was replaced by Blizzard guitarist Larry Lalonde. The band then hired Mechanics Bank heiress Debbie Abono (nee Downer), mother of LaLonde's then-girlfriend, Julie, to manage the band.

Author Daniel Ekeroth expanded on Lee's assessment of the 1984 Death Metal demo in his book, Swedish Death Metal:
The band originated in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1983, when San Pablo and El Sobrante residents Mike Torrao (rhythm guitar) and Mike Sus (drums) started a garage band with vocalist Barry Fisk and former Exodus bassist Jeff Andrews under the name Possessed. While the quartet had begun writing some music together, the line-up would be cut short when Fisk committed suicide by gunshot in front of his girlfriend's house in Tara Hills, California, and Andrews subsequently opted not to participate in the group any longer.

In 2017 the band signed a three album recording contract with Nuclear Blast Records.[21] By this time, the band consisted of Becerra and Marquez along with lead guitarist Daniel Gonzalez, bassist Robert Cardenas and rhythm guitarist Claudeous Creamer. Initially set for release in 2018, the band's third studio album Revelations of Oblivion was released on May 10, 2019, their first in 33 years.[22][23] The album entered the UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts at #7 in its first week.[24]
In 1993, former drummer Mike Sus retired from music to pursue other careers, going on to get a degree in psychology and is helping injured people to live a normal everyday life. He is also a drug addiction counselor.[49]
In a February 2021 interview,[25] vocalist Becerra stated that he will begin writing new material for the next Possessed album after the band finishes touring in support of Revelations of Oblivion.[26]
On Halloween 1986, Possessed released their second album Beyond the Gates. They embarked on a short European tour with Voivod and in the U.S. opening for Dark Angel.[15] In May 1987, the band issued a five-song EP produced by guitarist Joe Satriani titled The Eyes of Horror which marked a change in musical direction for the band. The Satanic themes they had become noted for were almost completely absent, and the songs had more of a thrash metal style than their earlier death metal sound. The song "Storm in My Mind" was written by Lalonde and the rest by Torrao, who had written most of the band's earlier material. Soon after the release, internal tensions among the band members led to their break up.

Possessed was different from all the other bands who were coming out at that time. They weren't pure noise, and they attempted to incorporate a lot of different musical ideas into their songwriting, not just rehash the same thing. They were into progressing as a band, which paved the way for other groups to expand their sound and do different things.[41]

Unlike virtually all other contemporary bands, Possessed left the Venom/Motörhead touches behind, creating "symphonic" tunes, and combining loads of complex riffs and drum patterns with the rawest sounds and fastest paces imaginable...Becerra took his vocal style one step beyond anything the world had heard before, as he seemed to scream and grunt at the same time. All these ideas would later be considered trademarks of death metal, and Possessed's demo has since generally been considered the first pure death metal recording.[43]

By late 2012, Possessed had begun writing new material for their first full-length studio album since 1986's Beyond the Gates.[20] They had performed several new songs live which were expected to appear on the new album.
At least four Possessed members who had written and recorded with the band at some point (vocalist/bassist Becerra and former guitarists Torrao, Montana and LaLonde) cite early Exodus and Venom as their main influences, in addition to NWOBHM acts like Motörhead, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, and other bands such as Rush, Scorpions and Van Halen.[27][28][29] Although AllMusic attributed Slayer as being a musical influence for Seven Churches,[30] the first Slayer album Show No Mercy had not been released until December 1983, shortly after members of Possessed were already writing material for their demo and debut album. Lyrically, most of Possessed's songs focused on Satanism and death.

Even while the band had played only a handful of gigs in the Bay Area, they earned a huge capital of popularity in Europe's metal scene.[35] Members of Napalm Death were influenced by Possessed and credit the band for their musical shift from grindcore to a more death metal direction after Scum.[36] In addition to their impression on overseas death metal, the group would also inspire black metal acts like Germany's Falkenbach,[37] Greece's Rotting Christ,[38] Switzerland's Samael[39] and Norway's Dimmu Borgir.[40]
Meanwhile, bassist / vocalist Jeff Becerra had recently split with his band Blizzard in the neighboring city of Pinole. That band included Larry LaLonde and Danny Boland on guitars and Michael Miner on drums, all of whom were high school students in the same graduating class. After being approached by Torrao and Sus, Becerra joined Possessed filling both the vacant vocal and bassist positions. The band had also placed an ad for a new guitarist which was answered by Brian Montana, and the second incarnation of Possessed was formed.[8][9]

The compilation drew the attention of Combat Records who signed the band and released their debut album Seven Churches in 1985,[10][12] with Roadrunner Records handling European distribution. In November of the same year, the band flew to Montreal, Quebec, Canada for the WWIII Weekend Festival in support of the Seven Churches release, playing alongside Celtic Frost, Destruction, Voivod and Nasty Savage. The concert was Possessed's first and largest arena appearance, with nearly 7,000 in attendance.[13] Possessed followed the release with a supporting tour which included a performance with Slayer and Venom at San Francisco's Kabuki in 1986.[14]

In 2007, it was announced Jeff Becerra would be performing under the "Possessed" name at the Wacken Open Air festival and would be backed by the members of Sadistic Intent, one of the bands featured on the Possessed tribute album Seven Gates of Horror released in 2004.[19] They would also headline the Gathering of the Bestial Legions III festival in Los Angeles.This same lineup also performed at Maryland Deathfest VIII in May 2010. After a U.S. tour with Danzig and Marduk, Rick and Bay Cortez along with Ernesto Bueno returned to Sadistic Intent, while drummer Emilio Marquez remained.

Mike Torrao formed an all new version of Possessed in 1990, taking over lead vocals himself, and recorded a two-song demo in 1991. Several different line-ups were attempted, and a four-song demo was recorded in 1993, but the group failed to gain momentum and disbanded shortly after.
Former lead guitarist Larry LaLonde joined the Bay Area thrash metal band Blind Illusion which released The Sane Asylum in 1988, after which Lalonde with Blind Illusion bassist Les Claypool went on to form the influential funk metal band Primus in 1989.[10][50]

Possessed's association with Debbie Abono would be a "first" for both sides: Abono would be the band's first manager, and Possessed were Abono's first managed signed band. A grandmother in her mid-fifties at that time,[44][45] Abono had no previous connection to heavy metal music other than as a concert designated driver for her daughters, one of whom was a girlfriend of guitarist Larry LaLonde.[45] Due to generation gap, Abono also had limited awareness of the sometimes blasphemous themes of heavy metal, and was allegedly offended upon reading the lyric sheet of Seven Churches.[35] Nevertheless, she agreed to manage and represent Possessed as long as Becerra and LaLonde finished high school commitments.[35] Although the group's relationship amongst themselves and their first manager would reach points of discord and eventual termination, Abono would go on to manage additional bands in the Bay Area thrash metal scene like Exodus, Vio-lence and Forbidden Evil, as well as death metal bands like Chicago's Broken Hope and Florida's Cynic and Obituary.[46]

Possessed are often cited as the first death metal band, largely because of the early use of grunted vocals, ultra-fast drumming and guitar tremolo picking as previously noted. In the 2004 book, Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore, Jeff Becerra staked claim to creating the "death metal" nomenclature in 1983.[31] The band's efforts on Seven Churches have been called an influence by groups like Death, Pestilence, Sepultura, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Sadistic Intent, Cannibal Corpse, Gorguts, Sinister, Vader, God Dethroned and Amon Amarth, the latter five bands having appeared on a 2004 Possessed tribute album.[32][33][34] Possessed's "The Exorcist" had been covered earlier by Cannibal Corpse on the 1993 Hammer Smashed Face EP.

Possessed is an American death metal band,[1][2][3] originally formed in 1983. Noted for their fast style of playing and Jeff Becerra's growled vocals, they are often called the first band in the death metal genre,[4] and paved the way for the 1980s Bay Area thrash metal scene, along with Metallica, Exodus, Testament and Death Angel.[5][6][7] The band is also notable for featuring future Primus member Larry LaLonde, who was the lead guitarist for Possessed from 1984 to 1987.
^ Ian Christe (2004). Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal (page 115). Harper Paperbacks. ISBN 0-380-81127-8.
After breaking up in 1987, and reforming from 1990 to 1993, the band reformed again under original bassist and vocalist Jeff Becerra in 2007. Since its inception, Possessed has released three studio albums − Seven Churches (1985), Beyond the Gates (1986) and Revelations of Oblivion (2019) − as well as one live album, two compilation albums and two EPs.
^ Many would however relate the Possessed sound to the old wave of Black Metal which was started by bands such as Venom, Hellhammer and Bathory.Possessed band page, Eduardo Rivadavia, Allmusic: "The brutal Seven Churches was arguably the first true death metal album and set the stage for the genre's breakaway from thrash."

Mayhem guitarist Euronymous was "the central figure involved in the formation of the Norwegian black metal scene",[25][better source needed] which he "almost single-handedly founded".[26] During May–June 1991,[27] he opened a record shop called Helvete[28] (Norwegian for "Hell"). The shop was at Schweigaards gate 56 in Oslo. Norwegian black metal musicians often met at the shop and in its basement. They included the members of Mayhem, the members of Emperor, Varg "Count Grishnackh" Vikernes of Burzum, and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch of Thorns. Euronymous also founded an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. It released albums by Norwegian bands Mayhem and Burzum, Swedish bands Merciless and Abruptum, and a Japanese band Sigh.[29][full citation needed] Euronymous, Varg,[6] and Emperor guitarist Tomas "Samoth" Haugen[30] lived in the shop at various times. Emperor drummer Bård "Faust" Eithun also lived and worked there.[4][6] The shop's walls were painted black and bedecked with medieval weapons, posters of bands, and picture discs, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.[4]
Police initially had no suspects, and Faust remained free for about a year.[82] However, he told Euronymous, Vikernes and a few others what he had done.[82] The day after the stabbing, he returned to Oslo and allegedly burnt down Holmenkollen Chapel with Vikernes and Euronymous. After Euronymous' murder in August 1993, Faust was arrested and confessed to Andreassen's murder. In 1994, he was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment, but was released in 2003.[85]

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at "outdoing" the stabbing in Lillehammer.[95] Vikernes denies this and claims he killed Euronymous in self-defense. He says Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while filming the event, using a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him.[6][89] Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract that night and "tell him to fuck off", but that Euronymous panicked and attacked him first.[89] The self-defense story is doubted by Faust,[96] while Necrobutcher believes Vikernes killed Euronymous due to the death threats he received from him.[97] Necrobutcher later alleged that he also intended to murder Euronymous himself due to him tastelessly capitalizing on Dead's suicide.[98]

According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by him and Euronymous with the goal of spreading fear, promoting black metal and getting more customers for Helvete.[88] Vikernes said of the interview, "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we ... had a good laugh, because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg."[89] He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime.[86] Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, "the journalist edited the interview and ... published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it."[87] Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence.[86]

Dead was found by Mayhem guitarist Euronymous with his wrists and throat slit and a gunshot wound to his forehead. Before calling the police, Euronymous got a camera and photographed the body after re-arranging some items.[6][10][13] One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: Dawn of the Black Hearts.[14]

In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.[77] On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment in Oslo. When they arrived there was a confrontation and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back.[94]

Those who gathered at Helvete have been referred to as the "Black Circle" or "Black Metal Inner Circle", a name allegedly invented by Euronymous.[6] Euronymous presented the "Black Circle" as an organized, cult-like group of militant Satanists whose activities were funded by his record shop, and a 1993 Kerrang! article referred to them as "Satanic terrorists".[33] Faust later said that it was "just a name that was invented for the people who hung around the shop ... there wasn't anything like members and membership cards and official meetings."[34] Likewise, in his review of Lucifer Rising, Varg Vikernes said, "The so-called 'Black Circle' was something Euronymous made up because he wanted to make people believe there was such a thing, but it was nonsense and never existed. The media on the other hand believed it existed for a while, but quickly stopped talking about it when they understood it was a fake rumor."[35]

Shortly after this episode, the Oslo police dispatched its Church Fire Group to Bergen, where they set up a makeshift headquarters in the Hotel Norge. According to Lords of Chaos, citing a police report, Vikernes knocked on their door and "virtually forced his way into the suite". He was "dressed in chain mail, carrying two large knives in his belt, and flanked by the two young men who apparently behaved as if they were his bodyguards or henchmen." Vikernes "stated that he was fed up with being harassed by the authorities, and that the police investigation into the Black Metal scene should be stopped." When police told him he had no right to issue orders, Vikernes "took one step back and raised his right arm in a Roman salute."[93]

Well, the original idea was to make a specialist shop for metal in general, but that's a long time ago. Normal metal isn't very popular any more, all the children are listening to 'death' metal now. I'd rather be selling Judas Priest than Napalm Death, but at least now we can be specialized within 'death' metal and make a shop where all the trend people know that they will find all the trend music. This will help us earning money so that we can order more EVIL records to the evil people. But no matter how shitty music we have to sell, we'll make a BLACK METAL look on the shop, we've had a couple of 'actions' in churches lately, and the shop is going to look like a black church in the future. We've also thought about having total darkness inside, so that people would have to carry torches to be able to see the records.
The Norwegian black metal scene was bitterly opposed to Christianity and organized religion as a whole. In interviews during the early 1990s, Euronymous and other members of the scene presented themselves as militant misanthropic Devil worshippers[39][better source needed] who wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. They attacked the Church of Satan for being too "humane".[40] The theistic Satanism they espoused was an inversion of Christianity.[41] Euronymous was the key figure behind this ideology.[31][25][better source needed] He professed to be in favor of totalitarianism and against compassion, peace, happiness and fun.[42] When asked why such statements were made to the press, Ihsahn of Emperor said, "I think that was very much to create fear among people."[43] He added that the scene "wanted to be in opposition to society" and "tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy".[44] Vikernes said that the reason they claimed to advocate "evil" was to provoke.[45]

According to Stian "Occultus" Johannsen, the space that Euronymous rented "was far too big and the rent was too high. That's the reason why it never did well." Only a small part of the building was used for the shop itself.[36] Euronymous shut Helvete in early 1993 when it began to draw the attention of the police and media. The store has since been reopened under the name Neseblod Records, in the same location but with much less floor space.[37] ('Neseblod' is Norwegian for 'nosebleed'.) Many of the original artifacts still remain, and the store also identifies as a "black metal museum".[38]

There was also rivalry between Norwegian and Finnish black metal bands. Impaled Nazarene printed "No orders from Norway accepted" and "Kuolema Norjan kusipäille!" ('Death to the arseholes of Norway!') on early pressings of their first album and innuendo and snarky comments were made in fanzines. Beherit's mainman 'Nuclear Holocausto' used the rivalry to play a series of telephone pranks on Mika Luttinen (of Impaled Nazarene) in which he would call him in the dead of the night playing nursery rhymes at high speed on a cassette recorder. At the time, Luttinen maintained that the messages were threats from Norwegian black metallers.[101] The Finnish band Black Crucifixion criticized the Norwegian band Darkthrone as "trendies" due to Darkthrone originally being a death metal band who later played black metal.[102]

Regarding the term "black metal", Euronymous said that it applies to any heavy metal band who are theistic Satanists and write Satanic lyrics.[42] Such ideas were repeated by other scene members, such as Faust.[56] At the time, bands with a style similar to Norwegian black metal, but without Satanic lyrics, tended to use other terms for their music.[57][58][59]

To coincide with the release of Mayhem's De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, Vikernes and Euronymous had allegedly plotted to bomb the Nidaros Cathedral, which appears on the album cover.[10] The musicians Faust,[70] Samoth,[68] (both of Emperor), and Jørn Inge Tunsberg (of Hades Almighty)[68][2] were also convicted for church arsons. Those convicted for church burnings showed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic "retaliation" against Christianity in Norway.[71] Mayhem drummer Hellhammer said he had called for attacks on mosques and Hindu temples, on the basis that they were more foreign.[72] Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Many musicians, singers, and songwriters in the early Norwegian black metal scene, such as Infernus and Gaahl of Gorgoroth, continue to praise the church burnings, with the latter saying "there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them."[19] Others, such as Necrobutcher and Kjetil Manheim of Mayhem and Abbath of Immortal,[19] see the church burnings as having been futile. Manheim claimed that many arsons were "just people trying to gain acceptance" within the black metal scene.[10] Watain vocalist Erik Danielsson respected the attacks, but said of those responsible: "the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course."[73]
In August 1993, several of its members were arrested and in May 1994 were convicted variously for arson, murder, assault and possession of explosives. Most showed no remorse for their actions at the time. The Norwegian media covered events closely, but the reporting was often sensationalist. Some referred to them as "Satanic terrorists" and one Norwegian TV channel interviewed a woman who claimed Satanists had sacrificed her child and killed her dog.[2] The early Norwegian black metal scene has since been the subject of books and documentaries.

They told the journalists details about the arsons that had not been released to the press and so BT spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details.[86] The article was published on 20 January as the front page of the BT. It was headlined "Vi tente på kirkene" ("We set the churches on fire") and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly hidden, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police allegedly found him by going to an address printed on a Burzum flyer,[86] although Vikernes believes that Tønder betrayed him.[87]
Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's "evil" image and claimed Dead had killed himself because black metal had become "trendy" and commercialized.[15] He made necklaces which he claimed as being made with bits of Dead's skull and gave them to musicians he deemed worthy.[16][17][18][19][20] There was also a false rumor that he had made a stew with bits of Dead's brain.[17][18]

Visually, the dark themes of their music were complemented with corpse paint, which became a way for black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the time,[9] yet some bands such as Emperor and Satyricon ceased wearing corpse paint, often citing its loss of meaning or trendiness due to use by so many bands.
In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, Bergens Tidende (BT), brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.[86] Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it.[86] In the anonymous interview, "Count Grishnackh" (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer.[86] BT journalist Finn Bjørn Tønder set up a meeting with "Count Grishnackh". The journalists were summoned to an apartment and, allegedly, warned they would be shot if the police were called.[86] There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and warned the attacks would continue. They claimed to be Devil worshippers and said, "Our intention is to spread fear and evil."

Some bands in the scene were interested in pre-Christian Norway and its traditions, and there was an undercurrent of romantic nationalism in the scene. Some scene members also flirted with Nazi imagery, but this was largely an attempt to provoke.[60][better source needed] In a private letter written in the early 1990s, Euronymous claimed that "almost all" Norwegian black metal bands at the time were "more or less Nazis".[61] He was interested in totalitarian communist states and said he wished to see people "rot under communist dictatorship".[62] However, apart from Varg Vikernes, the scene was largely non-political.[63][better source needed]

Faust claimed he felt no remorse at the time.[84] In the late 1990s, he said of the murder, "I was outside, just waiting to get out some aggression. It's not easy to describe why it happened. It was meant to happen, and if it was this man or another man, that's not really important."[84] Ihsahn, his bandmate in Emperor, said Faust "had been very fascinated by serial killers for a long time, and I guess he wanted to know what it's like to kill a person."[80] The media linked the murder to black metal, Satanism and fascism. In a 2008 interview, Faust said, "I was never a Satanist or fascist in any way, but I put behind me the hatred and negativity. Those feelings just eat you up from inside."[85]
Two other members of the scene would later commit suicide: Erik 'Grim' Brødreskift (of Immortal, Borknagar, Gorgoroth) in 1999[22][23] and Espen 'Storm' Andersen (of Strid) in 2001.[24]

Within just a few months [of Helvete opening], many young musicians had become obsessed with Euronymous and his ideas, and soon a lot of Norwegian death metal bands transformed into black metal bands. Amputation became Immortal, Thou Shalt Suffer turned into Emperor, and Darkthrone swapped their Swedish-inspired death metal for primitive black metal. Most notoriously, Old Funeral's guitar player Varg Vikernes had already left the band to form his own creation, Burzum.[32]

The early Norwegian black metal scene of the 1990s is credited with creating the modern black metal genre and produced some of the most acclaimed and influential artists in extreme metal. It attracted massive media attention when it was revealed that its members had been responsible for two murders, a suicide, and a wave of church burnings in Norway.
During the time it was open, Helvete was the focal point of the Norwegian black metal scene. Jon "Metalion" Kristiansen, writer of the fanzine Slayer, said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene".[31] Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,

In retrospect, Metalion wrote, "In the past, people just wrote about Satan, but now people meant it. I believe it was serious—maybe not all the Satanism, but definitely the approach to the music and the lifestyle. It was certainly more destructive than metal had been in the past."[54] Tenebris from the Misanthropic Luciferian Order (a Swedish Satanic order) wrote that the Norwegian scene "meant a lot as long as it lasted. Back then, in 1991, things mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism (not so much practical Satanism, but anyway ...) ... It grew quickly to become a sort of black metal army ... and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop. Therefore, it vanished with his death in '93 ... Sadly enough, many people involved at the time betrayed their ideals and lost their interest when things fell apart. Like it was nothing more than a hype of temporary nature."[55]

According to the book Lords of Chaos, many who knew Euronymous say that "the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that – a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality."[46] They include Necrobutcher,[47] Kjetil Manheim,[11] Vikernes,[6] and Blackthorn[48] (the latter two were convicted for his murder). Faust said that with Euronymous, "there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire."[4] Mortiis, however, said that Euronymous "was such a devil worshipper you wouldn't believe it",[49] and Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985[50] and considered him to be his best friend)[51] said Euronymous "was always telling what he thought ... worshipping death and being extreme."[31] As for the other scene members, Samuel Fridh says there is no evidence to support their early claims of being Devil worshippers,[52] and Leif A. Lier, who led the police investigation after Euronymous's death, said he and his men had not met one Satanist.[2] Faust said that "For some people it [Satanism] was bloody serious, but to a lot of them it was all a big hype."[53]
On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist and lyricist Per Yngve Ohlin (known by the stage name "Dead") committed suicide via shotgun blast while alone in a house shared by the band.[10][11] Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted and depressed. For performances, he made himself look like a corpse and would self-harm while performing.[4][12]

Mayhem bassist Jørn 'Necrobutcher' Stubberud noted that "people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself [...]; I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene."[21] The suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, especially Necrobutcher, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead.[10] Some claimed Euronymous "went into a fantasy world" and "tried to be as extreme as he had talked about".[10]

In 1992, members of the Norwegian black metal scene began a wave of arson attacks on Christian churches. By 1996, there had been at least 50 attacks in Norway;[2][28] in every case that was solved, those responsible were black metal fans.[65] Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. The first was Norway's Fantoft Stave Church, which was burnt to the ground in June 1992. Police believe Varg Vikernes of Burzum was responsible.[2] The cover of Burzum's EP Aske ("ashes") is a photograph of the destroyed church.[64] On 16 May 1994,[66] Vikernes was found guilty for burning down the Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church, and Åsane Church.[67][6] In addition, he was found guilty for an attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives.[68] Members of the Swedish black metal scene started to burn churches as well in 1993.[69]

Well, the original idea was to make a specialist shop for metal in general, but that's a long time ago. Normal metal isn't very popular any more, all the children are listening to 'death' metal now. I'd rather be selling Judas Priest than Napalm Death, but at least now we can be specialized within 'death' metal and make a shop where all the trend people know that they will find all the trend music. This will help us earning money so that we can order more EVIL records to the evil people. But no matter how shitty music we have to sell, we'll make a BLACK METAL look on the shop, we've had a couple of 'actions' in churches lately, and the shop is going to look like a black church in the future. We've also thought about having total darkness inside, so that people would have to carry torches to be able to see the records.

During the 1980s, black metal was a loose grouping of a handful of heavy metal bands who shared Satanic lyrics, although most of the "first wave" bands referred to Satanism only for shock value.[3] During 1990–1992, a number of Norwegian artists, who were strongly influenced by those bands, began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music. The surge of interest and popularity that followed is often referred to as the "second wave of black metal". The Norwegian bands developed the style of their 1980s forebears as a distinct genre of heavy metal music. This was partly thanks to a new style of guitar playing developed by Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns and Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth of Mayhem, in which guitarists played full chords using all the strings of the guitar in place of power chords, which use only two or three strings.[4][5] Gylve "Fenriz" Nagell of Darkthrone has credited them with this innovation in a number of interviews. He described it as being "derived from Bathory"[6] and noted that "those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s".[7] Black metal music also became much more satanic and the term 'TRVE KVLT Black Metal'[8] has since become the term for satanic-leaning black metal.

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993, and many other members of the scene were taken in for questioning around the same time.[90] Some confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for possession of 150 kg of explosives. Two churches were burned the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".[68] Blackthorn was sentenced to eight years in prison for being an accomplice to the murder.[68] That month saw the release of the Mayhem album De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, which features Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.[4] Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes, but Hellhammer said, "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record."[4] Vikernes was released from prison in 2009.[99]

Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media.[90] Vikernes condemned Euronymous for shutting the shop rather than taking advantage of the publicity, stating, "by doing so he also made all my efforts more or less pointless. I spent six weeks in custody because of that."[91] Norwegian magazine Rock Furore published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he said of the prison system, "It's much too nice here. It's not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It's completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence."[92] He was released in March for lack of evidence.[86]

There was a strong rivalry between Norwegian black metal and Swedish death metal scenes. Fenriz and Tchort have noted that Norwegian black metal musicians had become "fed up with the whole death metal scene"[100] and that "death metal was very uncool in Oslo" at the time.[10] A number of times, Euronymous sent death threats to some of the more 'mainstream' death metal groups in Europe.[10] Allegedly, a group of Norwegian black metal fans even plotted to kidnap and murder certain Swedish death metal musicians.[10]

The scene had an ethos and the core members referred to themselves as "The Black Circle" or "Black Metal Inner Circle". It consisted primarily of young men, many of whom gathered at the record shop Helvete ("Hell") in Oslo. In interviews, they voiced extreme anti-Christian and misanthropic views, presenting themselves as a cult-like group of militant Satanists who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil. They adopted pseudonyms and appeared in photographs wearing "corpse paint" and wielding medieval weaponry. The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those it deemed to be "trve"[1] or committed. Musical integrity was highly important and artists wanted black metal to remain underground and uncorrupted.
