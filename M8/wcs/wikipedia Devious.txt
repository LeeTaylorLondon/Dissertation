The fourth and final season premiered on June 6, 2016, and its main mystery is the sudden murder of Peri Westmore, and the involvement of a cult known as "The Circle" in the events leading up to it. Rosie takes charge in the investigation when Spence is wrongly incarcerated for the crime while also working two jobs, one as Genevieve's new maid and the other as Peri and Spence's son's (Carter Birchwell) nanny when Peri's sister Shannon (Katherine LaNasa) gets custody of him. Zoila has permanently quit being Genevieve's maid following the loss of her child when in labor, but due to the absence of her new employer (Kate Beahan) she's able to masquerade as a Beverly Hills' socialite and land a new man - Kyle (Ryan McPartlin) - who has an extremely close bond with his mother (Stephanie Faracy), the secret leader of "The Circle". Marisol's book is in the process of being made into a movie which leads her into the arms of studio head Peter Hudson (James Denton), but continues to have lingering feelings for Jesse, who has a fling with Danni (Sol Rodríguez), Carmen's daughter that she gave away at birth and now is starting to build a relationship with. Meanwhile, Adrian goes to great lengths to try and win Evelyn back who's moved in with and began working for Marisol on her journey to getting a divorce.

The fourth series, which saw the show undergo a significant overhaul and format switch, was hosted by JD Roberto with Don Priess announcing.
Pleased with the popularity of the reruns, PAX commissioned a new Shop 'til You Drop series that began airing on April 3, 2000. This series ran for two seasons and ended on May 24, 2002. Reruns of this 2000 series were picked up by GSN and began airing on December 2, 2013.[2][3]

The "Shopper's Challenge Round" was played after round two. During the round, the host asked a series of rapid-fire multiple-choice questions, again related to entertainment and shopping. The round was played for a 90-second time limit, and a correct answer awarded 50 points. Only one team member could answer each question, and partners switched places after a question was asked. If a team responded incorrectly, their opponents were given the chance to answer.
After the first stunt was played, the remaining team played the second stunt. Whichever team did not have the choice of playing or passing the first stunt in round one had the option in round two.
On December 19, 1993,[1] a one-hour Christmas special aired featuring celebrities playing for charity. Four teams competed instead of two, and gameplay was modified so that after the stunt round, the two lower-scoring teams were eliminated and the remaining two teams competed in the Shoppers' Challenge Round to determine a winner, where each correct answer was worth $500 and the time limit was increased to two minutes. Teams also played for money instead of points. In the Shop 'til You Drop round, the target was raised to $5,000 with a $10,000 bonus for reaching or exceeding that goal.

The backdrop of gameplay was a two-story shopping mall containing 14 stores. Two teams each consisting of two people (almost always male-female, married, engaged, dating, siblings, or best friends) competed against each other to win prizes and a trip.

Pat Finn hosted the first three editions of Shop 'til You Drop, beginning in 1991 and ending in 2002. The announcers for those series were Mark L. Walberg, who announced from 1991 to 1994 and served as an on-air assistant, Jason Grant Smith, who was the original announcer for the second series in 1996 and 1997, and Dee Bradley Baker, who announced and co-hosted from 1997 to 1998 and again from 2000 until 2002.
Round three, the "Shopper's Challenge" round, remained the same as in previous versions.
Successfully completing the stunt earned points (100 in round one, 200 in round two) and allowed the team to choose a store located on the first floor of the mall, winning a prize associated with that store. Although the stores and prize specialty associated with each store varied from episode to episode, each generally featured prizes typical of game shows (furniture, electronics, artwork, etc.). One of the stores each day featured the "Shopper's Special", which also awarded a mini vacation if chosen.
During the show's first season, in order to win the trip, the team only needed to obtain $1,000 in prizes during the Shop 'til You Drop Round. Also, in the first season, there was always at least one store which featured a prize worth $500 or more. In addition, some of the boxes contained gag gifts, which were typically worth less than $50. Later in the first season, there were always at least two stores which featured prizes worth $300 or more. The gag gifts were eliminated when the goal was raised to $2,500 at the start of the second season.
However, according to the Copyright Office registration record for the Shop 'til You Drop Christmas special, the original publication of the show took place December 27, 1993.

The Family Channel (American TV network, founded 1990) original programming
Shop 'til You Drop aired on Lifetime from July 8, 1991, to September 30, 1994, with reruns airing until May 31, 1996. The show was produced by Stephen Brown. On June 17, 2015, GSN began airing reruns of this version, starting with episodes from 1993.
The warehouse store edition of Shop 'til You Drop premiered on October 6, 2003, and ran until May 27, 2005. Reruns continued until August 11, 2006, by which time PAX had been rebranded as i: Independent Television (later changed to Ion Television).
The shopper stood in front of a table with six boxes, each concealing a prize. When the round began, the shopper opened the first box and decided whether or not to keep the prize. If the prize was kept, the runner brought the box to a table across the stage and rang a bell signaling the shopper to open the next box. If the shopper wanted to exchange the prize, the runner took the box to any of the 14 stores in the mall, left the opened item there and brought the unopened box from the new store to the prize table and rang the bell. Play continued until six items were kept/exchanged, or until time ran out. At least one of the stores in the mall contained a prize worth at least $700.

In 1996, The New Shop 'til You Drop was developed for The Family Channel as part of its afternoon game show block. The revival debuted on September 30, 1996, and ran until August 14, 1998.

After each completed challenge, as before, the team would win a prize of their choice. To choose, the other member of the team would run into the store and pick up a gift box from one department, then run it back to the gameplay area. Each department had a sign with a blue light on it, but the teams could only take from departments where the lights were flashing. The Shopper's Special was still attached to one of the prizes.
For the Shop 'til You Drop Round, team members alternated roles instead of one defined as the shopper and the other as the runner. One team member opened a box and the other handed the item off to their partner, who decided whether to keep or exchange the item for any prize in a department with a flashing light, then brought the associated box to a table and rang a bell. That team member then came back and handed off the next item to their teammate, who repeated the process. The 90-second time limit and $2,500 goal remained the same.

Shop 'til You Drop is an American game show that was on the air intermittently between 1991 and 2005. Four different series were produced during that time, with the first premiering on Lifetime on July 8, 1991, and the fourth series airing its final episode on May 27, 2005, on PAX TV.
Once the first half of the round was completed, the retail values of the prizes on the table were added one-by-one. If the total of the prizes reached or exceeded $2,500, the couple also won a trip. Regardless of the outcome, the couple kept all prizes that were placed on the table prior to time expiring, as well as any prizes won during the first two rounds of gameplay.

The team with the most points at the end of the round won the game and advanced to the bonus round. If a tie occurred, a final question was asked. A team who buzzed-in and answered correctly advanced to the bonus round. If a team answered incorrectly, the other team automatically won the game.
Reruns of the 1996 series, as well as of the final season of the Lifetime edition, aired on PAX TV from April 5, 1999, until March 31, 2000, as part of an hour block of game show reruns with the final season of Supermarket Sweep. GSN reran the entire 1997–98 season in 2015.
The bonus round involved a shopping spree in which the team tried to accumulate a prize package of at least $2,500 within 90 seconds. One of the team members was the shopper while the other team member was the runner.
Nearly all of the stunts were mini-games played in a one-minute time limit, which tested popular culture and consumer knowledge. The winners of a coin toss followed the host to the play area of the first stunt. After being told the specific gameplay, the team decided whether to play the stunt or pass and force their opponents to play. Stunts varied widely, but most involved the team answering questions based upon a pop culture category, or various other games based on pricing merchandise.
During the first season of the Lifetime version, stunts similar to those on Beat the Clock (such as the female partner stuffing a certain number of balloons into a pair of oversized trousers worn by her husband without breaking any) were also played in the first two rounds. Some early stunts were played with a 30-, 45-, or (rarely) 90-second time limit.

According to Marcos Carnevale, the writer of the Argentine version, Manzanares was the hardest thing to adapt. The houses had to look “more Latin”, but still remain similar to the original show's street, so the houses were painted in a more Latino style (for example, the Solises’ house is red instead of yellow).

At the end of Manzanares, by Carla's house, there is a cul-de-sac. However, cars are seen both entering and leaving the neighborhood from there.
Buena Vista International, a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company (which also owns ABC, the channel on which Desperate Housewives airs in the United States), searched in Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia to find a production company capable of adapting the series for the Spanish-speaking market. Adrian Suar and Fernando Blanco's Pol-Ka Producciones in Argentina was selected. Immediately, the actresses were chosen and the construction of Manzanares Street began on the town of Pilar, Buenos Aires.
From the outside, Vera's home has a set of windows either side of the front porch. However indoors, windows can only be seen on one side of the front door. This is because the inside of Vera's house is actually shot on a soundstage. Along with the houses of Lía, Marta Hidalgo, Carla and Alicia, is just a façade.
Based on the American television series, Desperate Housewives, it was developed for Argentina by Buena Vista International Television (Disney) and Pol-Ka Producciones. The show's only season was broadcast by Canal 13 in Argentina, and also by other networks in Uruguay and Paraguay.

The set of the street, some of which is made up of real houses, is located on a studio of Pol-ka, in Pilar, Buenos Aires, which was land due to be turned into an upscale gated community. Manzanares was specially built for the production of the three Desperate Housewives versions: the Argentine, Latin (USA), Colombian-Ecuadorian and Brazilian versions.
After Carla's house was burned down in the first episode, her new house started being built next to her old. The old house façade was kept, repainted, and the interior was reconstructed and was used on episode 21 as the Obligado's house (Mullins in the original show).

Amas de casa desesperadas is an Argentine television series, it was originally Canal 13 from 30 August 2006 to 24 January 2007. Set in the fictional Manzanares Street, a suburb surrounding Buenos Aires, the series follows the lives of four housewives and the domestic problems and daily mysteries surrounding their husbands, friends and neighbors, which can be more sinister than they appear. The series' tone combines elements of drama, comedy, mystery, farce, soap opera and satire.
The show opens with the mysterious suicide of housewife Alicia Oviedo on a beautiful day in the suburbs, on a street called Manzanares. Alicia, who narrates the show from the afterlife, had four friends: Vera Sherer, the seemingly perfect mother of two teenagers struggling to save her marriage; Lía Salgarí, the mother of four whose husband is always away on business; Susana Martini, the divorced mother in search of love, who finds it in the form of her new neighbour Miguel Delfino, who has a secret of his own; and Gabriela Solís, the materialistic ex-runway model who cheats on her husband. While trying to be good wives and mothers, the four friends also try to find out why their friend committed suicide. The discovery of a blackmail note among Alicia's belongings, a therapy session tape in which she admits her real name was Angela, and her widowed husband's strange behaviour really make them wonder about the mystery surrounding their deceased friend.

There is a 10th house on the street, that is hidden (next to Elvira Reinoso's house) and can only be seen when the camera pulls away on the ending of the first episode. The “production house” is used by the crew as an office.

Brian Lowry of Variety gave the show a negative review saying, "Like so many former primetime titans, it's perplexing to see Barr reduced to this [...]" and "Why Barr wanted to participate in this sort of "celebreality" unscripted sitcom—especially if she hates Hollywood as much as she says—is a little less obvious, especially since she professes not to need the money and, given her syndication bounty, shouldn't".[22] David Hinckley of the Daily News gave it two out of five stars. He said, "Roseanne fans will be reassured, though not surprised, to hear that she sounds and acts exactly the same on the plantation as she did on her sitcom set".[23]

"Roseanne to Return to TV in New Lifetime Reality Show"
During its second week the first episode brought in 1,037,000 viewers with a Rating/Share of 0.4, a three-point decrease from the premiere. The second episode remained at a 0.4 Rating/Share with 977,000 viewers. It did the same as repeats of Pawn Stars that aired before Rosanne's Nuts, but Pawn Stars had more total viewers.[3] During its sixth week it dropped to 711,000 viewers, losing more than half its premiere audience and scoring a 0.3 Rating/Share.[7] The season finale brought in 629,000 viewers with a 0.2 Rating/Share.[12]
David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a positive review and welcomed Barr back to television.He wrote: "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her up as much as they do her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience".He also noted that a reality show format "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...]". He ended his review: "The wild pigs might not want to stick around, but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least.[19]Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune wrote in his review, "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".[21]
Lifetime sent only the first episode to critics in advance.[19]Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote a positive review. She said, "There are no overproduced glamorous outings, no sound-track manipulated showdowns, no manufactured feuds — everyone in the pilot has the easy genial mien of friends helping out an odd but beloved neighbor. There's even a trio of local musicians providing a transitional tune", calling the result, "occasionally weird, occasionally hilarious show that is simultaneously a window into the life of an eccentric performer and a wickedly fun send-up of the genre, dating all the way to Paris Hilton and The Simple Life.She also compared a scene in the first episode where Barr hunts wild pigs to Sarah Palin's Alaska as a spoof.[20]

Two participants from Season 3, Vanessa Nelson and David Norton, both took part in the first season of the second spinoff Married at First Sight: Second Chances. Both David and Vanessa selected from a group of men (for Nelson) and women (for Norton) to date in a format similar to that of The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, ultimately ending with each of them choosing someone to marry. The groups were narrowed down from one hundred (in a speed dating-like situation) to twenty-five, to ten. After Vanessa and David each picked their top ten, they eliminated one person each episode (with the exception of one week's double elimination) until finding 'the one'. The first season premiered on 27 April 2017 and concluded on 6 July 2017 with Vanessa becoming engaged to Andre, although they ultimately ended their relationship, and David choosing to marry no one.

The Hollywood Reporter was founded in 1930 by William R. "Billy" Wilkerson (1890–1962) as Hollywood's first daily entertainment trade newspaper.[1] The first edition appeared on September 3, 1930, and featured Wilkerson's front-page "Tradeviews" column, which became influential. The newspaper appeared Monday-to-Saturday for the first 10 years, except for a brief period, then Monday-to-Friday from 1940. Wilkerson used caustic articles and gossip to generate publicity and got noticed by the studio bosses in New York and some studio lots tried to ban the paper.[2]

In 1932, Variety sued The Hollywood Reporter, alleging that THR was plagiarizing information from Variety following its publication in New York on Tuesdays, by way of phoning or wiring the information back to Hollywood, so that THR could publish the information before Variety reached Hollywood three days later on Friday.[3] Then, in 1933, Variety started its own daily Hollywood edition, Daily Variety, to cover the film industry.[4]

In March 2006 a private equity consortium led by Blackstone and KKR, both with ties to the conservative movement in the United States, acquired THR along with the other assets of VNU.[14] It joined those publications with AdWeek and A.C. Nielsen to form The Nielsen Company.[15]
However, staffing levels began to drop again in 2008. In April, Nielsen Business Media eliminated between 40 and 50 editorial staff positions at The Hollywood Reporter and its sister publications: Adweek, Brandweek, Editor & Publisher and Mediaweek.[53] In December, another 12 editorial positions were cut at the trade paper.[54] In addition, 2008 saw substantial turnover in the online department: THR.com Editor Melissa Grego left her position in July to become executive editor of Broadcasting & Cable,[55] and Managing Editor Scott McKim left to become a new media manager at Knox College. With the entertainment industry as a whole shrinking, "Hollywood studios have cut more than $20 million from the Motion Picture Association of America budget this year. The resulting staff and program reductions are expected to permanently shrink the scope and size of the six-studio trade and advocacy group."[56]

From the late 1930s, Wilkerson used The Hollywood Reporter to push the view that the industry was a communist stronghold. In particular, he opposed the screenplay writers' trade union, the Screen Writers Guild, which he called the "Red Beachhead".[7][8] In 1946 the Guild considered creating an American Authors' Authority to hold copyright for writers, instead of ownership passing to the studios. Wilkerson devoted his "Tradeviews" column to the issue on July 29, 1946, headlined "A Vote for Joe Stalin." He went to confession before publishing it, knowing the damage it would cause, but was apparently encouraged by the priest to go ahead with it.[7][9]
