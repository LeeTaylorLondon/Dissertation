Psychological warfare can involve creating annoyances to distract and wear down the resistance of the target. For example, in 1993, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) played music "specifically selected for its irritation ability" on loudspeakers outside the Branch Davidian church in Waco, Texas in an attempt to bring about the surrender of David Koresh and his followers.[2]
Various reasons exist for why one finds particular stimuli annoying. Measurement of annoyance is highly subjective. As an attempt at measurement, psychological studies on annoyance often rely on their subjects' own ratings of levels of annoyance on a scale. Any kind of stimuli can cause annoyance, such as getting poked in the side or listening to a song repeatedly.Many stimuli that one is at first neutral to, or even finds pleasant, can turn into annoyances from repeated continued exposure.One can often encounter annoyance factors in media, including popular music, memes, commercials, and advertising jingles, which by their nature are continually repeated over a period of weeks or months.

Annoyance is an unpleasant mental state that is characterized by irritation and distraction from one's conscious thinking. It can lead to emotions such as frustration and anger. The property of being easily annoyed is called irritability.
This page was last edited on 10 March 2023, at 14:31 (UTC).
A study published in the International Journal of Conflict Management found that one's response to an annoyance, at least when the perceived cause is another person, escalate to more extreme levels as they go unresolved.[1] It also found that one was more likely to blame the party who was causing the annoyance in the study, rather than one's self, for the annoyance as it escalated.
In the sense of "nuisance", the noun "annoyance" is found in the English "Jury of Annoyance" appointed by an act of 1754 to report upon obstructions in the highways.[3]

"Rude" was named after the reggae term "rude boy" and originally based on a real-life situation. The lead singer of Magic!, Nasri, had been in an unhealthy relationship with a previous girlfriend. After the two of them got into a fight with each other, the band based the song off that headline. The couple was in a "mean time" when they were both being rude to each other, as Nasri says in what he describes as a "dark vibe".[4]

Rude is a surname. Notable people with the surname include:
Gilbert T. Rude (1881–1962), American Coast and Geodetic Survey and Navy officer

However, there is no universal rule about which terms are considered derogatory and which questions are inappropriate under what circumstances. A question or comment that is acceptable between family members might be resented from strangers, just like a question that is acceptable among young people in one culture might be unacceptable to older people or to young people in a different culture.
Rude ways of speaking include inappropriately discouraging a person's participation in a conversation with rude phrases, such as shut up or using a tone of voice that indicates disrespect for the other person. An impolite tone may amplify obviously rude remarks or contradict nominally polite words. A rude person may interrupt a speaker to indicate that the first speaker is unimportant.
Both manners and morality deal with whether a thing is morally good or bad, but at different levels. Unlike morality, which, for example, condemns murder as a violation of a person, manners primarily concerns itself with violations of human dignity, rather than the person's health or property.[2] Rude behaviour is a violation of human dignity or of the respect due to others.[citation needed]
Failing to speak can also be rude:a rude person might pointedly ignore a legitimate and polite greeting or question to communicate disregard for the other person, or might fail to express appropriate thanks for favors or gifts by way of communicating either a sense of selfish entitlement or a disregard for the efforts of the giver. Sometimes people will leave very short gaps when speaking that may allow another person to begin speaking on a subject, however that can vary, and sometimes two or more people speaking at the same time can be considered rude. Which acts and communications require a response from which persons, under which circumstances, and what kind of response is required, depends on the culture and the social situation of the people concerned.
In every culture, it is possible to act rudely, although what constitutes rude behaviour varies. The following are examples of behaviour that many Western societies would consider rude or a breach of etiquette, though views may vary by culture, setting, or individual circumstances:
Miss Manners rescues civilization: from sexual harassment, frivolous lawsuits, dissing, and other lapses in civility
Many behaviours can be rude.These often depend upon the context, including time, place, and culture.

What constitutes rude speech depends on the culture, the setting, and the speaker's social position in the culture. In every culture, some words or statements are considered hate speech or inappropriate ethnic slurs (such as using the word Hun to a German, using the word Jap to a Japanese person, etc.). In most modern cultures, insulting a person or group of people, especially for any reason outside their immediate control, such as having a medical condition, being a particular gender, or being poor, is considered rude. Rude speech also includes derogatory terms describing an individual person and asking inappropriate questions or pressing for answers to a question.
One last form of using rudeness is as a rite of passage. For example, some black communities in the United States use The Dozens as a mechanism to promote verbal abuse resilience and maturity among young people.

Cultural differences also appear over time. In the mid-20th century, the meaning of eye rolling changed from its older signal of lust and passion to expressing contempt.[4]

This includes a failure to dress appropriately for an occasion, whether by dressing too informally, too formally, immodestly, or otherwise inappropriately (e.g., a young woman in public without a veil in Iran; a young woman in public with a veil in France).C. S. Lewis writes that "A girl in the Pacific islands wearing hardly any clothes and a Victorian lady completely covered in clothes might both be equally 'modest,' proper, or decent, according to the standards of their own societies"—but that in each culture, the idea of immodest, improper, and indecent dress existed, and that violating the culture's standard was rude.[8]
Robin Lakoff addressed what she named "strategic rudeness", a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists (attack therapy) to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.[5]Rudeness in everyday speech "is frequently instrumental, and is not merely pragmatic failure".[6] Most rude speakers are attempting to accomplish one of two important instrumental functions: to vent negative feelings, and/or to get power.[7]
The specific actions that are considered polite or rude vary dramatically by place, time, and context. Differences in social role, gender, social class, religion, and cultural identity may all affect the appropriateness of a given behaviour.Consequently, a behaviour that is considered perfectly acceptable by one group of people may be considered clearly rude by another. For example, in medieval and Renaissance Europe, it was rude to indicate that a man wearing a mask in public could be recognized.[3] Instead, polite behaviour demanded that the masked person be treated as a completely unknown person and that no one ever attribute the masked person's actions to the individual who performed them. By contrast, in the modern era, greeting a friend by name while he is wearing a mask, or talking to them later about their costume or activities, is not generally regarded as rude.
"Oh, Please: When did we start rolling our eyes to express contempt?"
Forms of rudeness include acting inconsiderate, insensitive, deliberately offensive, impolite, obscenity, profanity and violating taboos such as deviancy. In some cases, an act of rudeness can go so far as to be a crime, for example, the crime of hate speech.
Rudeness (also called effrontery) is a display of actual or perceived disrespect by not complying with the social norms or etiquette of a group or culture. These norms have been established as the essential boundaries of normally accepted behavior. To be unable or unwilling to align one's behavior with these norms known to the general population of what is socially acceptable is to be rude and are enforced as though they were a sort of social law, with social repercussions or rewards for violators or advocates, respectively.
Other rude behaviours have the effect of communicating disrespect for other people.In extreme cases, this can rise to complete and deliberate social exclusion of the disrespected person; in others, the rudeness is only temporary and may be unintentional.For example, it can be rude to use electronic devices, such as mobile phones, if this results in ignoring someone or otherwise indicating that the present company is less interesting or important than the people elsewhere or the text messages they send.Similarly, cutting in line signals that the person cutting in the line believes themselves to be more important that the people their action delays.Barging into someone else's space without permission, whether that be a violation of personal space or crashing a party, is rude because it does not respect the person's property rights or right to make personal choices.
Labov, W. (1972). Language in the inner city: Studies in the Black English vernacular. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. ISBN 978-0-8122-1051-4.
Rudeness, "constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium".[1] Rudeness, particularly with respect to speech, is necessarily confrontational at its core.
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviours to achieve a goal. Early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication. However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.

Samobor is one of the earliest tourist resorts in the region, with the first tourist facilities dating back to 1810, catering to anglers, hunters and hikers. The town's beautiful surroundings and vicinity to the capital have supported this tourist tradition to the present day. In 1846, Samobor was paid a visit by the composer Franz Liszt, who at that time was visiting Zagreb during one of his numerous concert tours. Liszt came to Samobor to see his friend Ferdo Livadić, in his lodgings at the Livadić mansion, which is today the town museum.At the beginning of the 20th century, the Livadić mansion came under the ownership of a Jewish family named Daničić. They were forced to leave as a result of the Nazi invasion in 1941. Shortly after this, the mansion wasconfiscated by the newly formed Independent State of Croatia and never returned to the Daničić family. On Tepec hill, a 10-minute walk from the city centre, there are still-visible remains of the Samobor Castle fortress built in the 13th century.
Srednja škola Samobor (English: Samobor High School), consisting of two academies teaching arts such as economy and trade; the Gimnazija Antuna Gustava Matoša (English: Antun Gustav Matoš Comprehensive School);

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Samobor was a district capital in the Zagreb County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.

One of the chief industries in Samobor is crystal cutting, acclaimed in Europe and all over the world.
On the side, Jake recorded albums with his other bands, Tennessee Voodoo Coupe and Blue Mercury Coupe.
His European tours inspired him to make a new jump blues influenced live album with his 7-piece band and special guests. Live & Out Loud was recorded in November 2011 in front of a live audience at The Drake Hotel in Toronto, funded in large part by fans through the crowdfunding platform RocketHub.
Jake stepped away from recording and touring for several years, during which time he began practicing Zen Buddhism.He returned in 2009 with a new album, Quicksand. He started touring Canada and Europe again in 2010, as well as playing in the United States.
Seeking to get this record distributed in the US, Big Rude Jake left Toronto, establishing himself in Brooklyn, New York, where he signed a record deal with Roadrunner Records. A third album, Big Rude Jake, was released in 1999. While one of the most well known at the time, it is the hardest album for fans to find, as Jake had control of distribution over all albums except this one.
Hiebert died on 16 June 2022, at the age of 59, from metastatic small cell carcinoma of the bladder.[3]

Butane Fumes & Bad Cologne, the first record by Big Rude Jake and his Gentlemen Players, was recorded in 2 days, on 26 and 27 July 1993 in Toronto. With what the group described as a "ridiculous puny budget", the idea was to record "live off the floor, just like the old cats did".[2] The album was produced by Gordie Johnson of local rock act Big Sugar and Pete Prilesnick. The executive producer was Michael L. Johnson.
Hiebert also played music for seniors in long term care for many years.
In 2002, he recorded a fourth album, Live Faust, Die Jung, which is totally different from the first three.It was produced by Jake Langley and Big Rude Jake, but was never officially released, as he was badly injured one night after being struck by a taxi.He 'disappeared' from the public eye for a while, going into semi-retirement.When he began playing publicly again, he used the moniker Chet Valiant, stepping back from the "big suit party animal persona" of Big Rude Jake.Maintaining a lower profile, he focused on honing his ragtime guitar skills and kept composing.He began to play a few shows as Big Rude Jake again in 2006.

Big Rude Jake's bio on VH1 Archived 1 October 2007 at the Wayback Machine
Andrew Jacob Hiebert (1 March 1963 – 16 June 2022), known professionally as Big Rude Jake, was a Canadian songwriter, singer, musician, and bandleader based in Toronto. The original "Swing Punk", he was associated with the neo-swing trend of the 1990s. Jake was drawn to the roots of American music, and incorporated elements of jazz, blues, gospel, jump, and rockabilly, among others.[1] His finger picking ragtime guitar style was inspired by the likes of Mose Scarlet and Leon Redbone.
In 2020, he launched Fanfare Music Enrichment Services, serving intellectually challenged clients.

Blue Pariah, the second album, followed in 1996, and "Swing Baby!" was aired in college radios across Canada and United States. It was produced by Gordie Johnson, and engineered and mixed by Peter Prilesnik.Blue Pariah also featured Ashley MacIsaac on violin.This album was deliberately designed to set Big Rude Jake apart from all the other bands on the swing scene. It uses what some thought to be rather elaborate production techniques.

Produced with the assistance of the Canadian Film Centre,[7] Rude was the first Canadian dramatic feature to be written, produced, and directed by an all-black team.[8] It was hailed, along with Soul Survivor, as ushering in a new Black Canadian film aesthetic.[9]
Set in Toronto, Ontario,[3] the film tells three distinct but interrelated stories about Black Canadian life in the impoverished Regent Park neighbourhood of the city.[4] One focuses on "The General" (Maurice Dean Wint), a drug dealer trying to rebuild his life with the help of his brother Reece (Clark Johnson) after being released from prison; one centres on Jordan (Richard Chevolleau), an amateur boxer who is convinced to take part in a gay-bashing which forces him to finally confront his own repressed homosexuality; the third centres on Maxine (Rachael Crawford), a woman who has recently been dumped by her longtime boyfriend after having an abortion.[5] All three stories are tied together by the voice of Rude (Sharon Lewis), a disc jockey for a pirate radio station in the neighbourhood.[6]
