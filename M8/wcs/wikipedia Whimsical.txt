Whimsical Willy is a minor antagonist from the Cartoon Network animated series The Powerpuff Girls, only appearing in the episode "Neighbor Hood".
Just then, Dynamite Dog ran in and warned Whimsical Willy about an evil cloud of darkness, that was engulfing Daydream Lane. Whimsical Willy told the kids watching that only they had the ability to save them from the evil cloud of darkness. Whimsical Willy told the kids that if they sent them enough "Happy Paper", then they would be able to shoo the darkness cloud away. Whimsical Willy showed everybody an address, for them to send the happy paper to.

Kids all over Townsville believed this, and they gathered together a bunch of money and sent it to the address. Bubbles broke into the bank and stole all of the money in Townsville and brought it straight to Whimiscal Willy.
Whimsical Willy and his scheme is a reference to a real-life incident, that occurred on New Year's Day of 1965, where an episode of The Soupy Sales Show, had a message to children, telling them to steal "green pieces of paper with pictures of guys with beards on it" from their parents and send it to a specific address, which was the address of show runner, Milton Supman. Sure enough, many children actually followed these instructions, and Supman raked in a rough total of eighty thousand off of this scam.
Blossom and Buttercup saw Bubbles on TV, and learned about what just happened. They went to the set of the show, to prove to Bubbles that everything was fake and revealed to her that Whimsical Willy was nothing but a lying, thieving, con artist. Bubbles was heartbroken, to hear about her idol being a liar. She furiously kicked his butt, and knocked him out cold with a happy face mask, sending him straight to jail. In prison, Whimsical Willy was soon beaten senseless, by his former minions, as they also had to get sent to jail.

The children of Pokey Oaks kindergarten rushed home to catch the new episode of "The Wondrous World of Whimsical Willy", a children's TV show that was all the rage. Bubbles watched the show from her house, and so did many other kids, as well as The Mayor. The episode started off innocently enough, with Whimsical Willy, just showing his audience a bunch of random objects, such as happy face and sad face masks. Whimsical Willy went to Daydream Lane to see his friends, Maid Mary, Kitty the Elephant, and Duke Monday.

Smith has the distinction of being the last member of the Cardinals to wear the number 51. In his major league debut, he donned the number associated with retired fan favorite Willie McGee, upsetting many fans. Shortly thereafter, Smith agreed to change his number to 52 and no one has used 51 since.
Smith was most recently a member of the Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball League in 2007 until retiring from baseball.
For his career, Smith was 7–8 with a 4.95 earned run average in 132.7 innings. He made 27 appearances with 24 starts, with the no-hitter being his only complete game shutout.
Smith's major league career was short but notable, as he became the 18th rookie since 1900 to throw a no-hitter. Smith's Cardinals defeated the San Diego Padres 4–0 on September 3, 2001, with the rookie hurler giving up four walks but no hits, while throwing 134 pitches in the game.[2] Due to Smith's high pitch count entering the later innings, Cardinal pitching coach Dave Duncan was actually hoping someone would break up the no-hitter, fearing that his young pitcher might tire, although he went against that judgment in allowing Smith to finish the game. As of February 2023[update], Smith's is the most recent no-hitter by a Cardinals' pitcher.[3]
In 2000, Smith led the minor league Cardinal organization with a 2.26 ERA (among starters) and 17 wins (5 with AAA Memphis and 12 with AA Arkansas) and threw two no-hitters of the seven-inning variety against Midland and San Antonio.His 2000-year performance earned him Baseball Weekly's Minor League Pitcher of the Year award.[1]
Smith had an impressive rookie season in 2001, compiling a 6–3 record and 3.83 earned run average in 16 games, good for fourth in Rookie of the Year voting. However, after posting a dreadful 6.94 era in his sophomore season, he never pitched at the major league level again.
On July 29, 2002, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with infielder Plácido Polanco and relief pitcher Mike Timlin for third baseman Scott Rolen, relief pitcher Doug Nickle and cash. Smith never made a major league appearance for the Phillies, and on October 15, 2004, was granted free agency. He later signed with the Minnesota Twins on December 14, 2004.
