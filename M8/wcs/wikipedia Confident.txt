Upon its release, Confident received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Awarding the album four stars at AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing, "the cumulative result is a messy, colorful modern pop record that is greater than the sum of its parts."[16] Annie Zaleski from The A.V. Club gave the album a B+, saying, "Confident is an impressive album by a pop star who knows what she wants—and also knows exactly how to get there."[60] The Guardian gave a mixed review of the album, saying, "Only a certain sheen that turns her vocals into a generic hybrid of Sia and Kelly Clarkson stops Confident from being one of the pop albums of 2015."[64] Mike Wass from Idolator gave a mixed review, saying, "There's no right or wrong approach, but if you're going to relaunch as an irreverent pop siren like Teenage Dream-era Katy Perry, you better have an album full of surefire hits to back it up. And Confident is lacking in that department."[67] Nick Levine gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, saying, "It's powerful stuff, especially from a singer who has bravely spoken out about her past struggles with depression, drug and alcohol abuse and an eating disorder, but ultimately Confident feels a bit relentless."[20]

The album's fourth track is "For You", Maura Johnston of Billboard described it as a "majestic devotional". She noted the song "has a backup choir singing "For you I would do anything" as Lovato sings about summoning strength, her performance making her inner power even more plain."[32] The album first ballad, "Stone Cold" discusses the pain of watching an ex move on and be happy with someone else.[32] The song incorporates pop and soul influences, and is centered on a piano melody, with a stripped down production aimed at highlighting Lovato's vocals.[33] "Stone Cold" received comparisons to Lovato's 2011 song "Skyscraper" and the work of English singer Adele.[32] The album follow with the trap-pop song "Kingdom Come"[17][32][34][35] it features vocal appearance by rapper Iggy Azalea. Several critics noted that the song is comparable to Azalea's "Black Widow" (2014), featuring Rita Ora.[17][24] "Waitin for You" featuring vocals by singer Sirah, musically, it's an R&B and hip hop[30] song that starts with a "dark and atmospheric opening" and is characteristic for having "a massive beat increase which appears to result in a impending crescendo but then results in a beat-drop". "Wildfire" is a soul-pop song.[30] In the song, Lovato sings with synths and snaps floating around her voice.[32] "Yes" was described as a sultry R&B song while in "Father" Lovato uses a higher vocal register, which "maximizes her emotional impact".[30] The stripped down gospel song "Father" is dedicated for Lovato's biological father who died in 2013. It is the most personal song on the album.[17][18][20][32] The Sleigh Bells-sampling twelfth track "Stars"[36][37] is an uptempo pop song with a "killer chorus", while the last track of Confident's deluxe edition "Mr. Hughes" is a "retro-R&B" song.[31]
"Cool for the Summer" reached international success, it was serviced as the lead single from the record on July 1, 2015, it debuted at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100 in its first week dated July 18, 2015, selling 80,000 copies in.[45] It entered the Hot 100's top 20 on the chart dated August 15, 2015 and peaked at number 11.[46] It has since been certified double platinum in the US by the RIAA.[47] The song went top 10 in the UK, New Zealand, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Lebanon and top 20 in Canada, Ireland, Australia and Spain.[48][49][50][51]

The ballad "Father" is the most personal song on the album. It is dedicated to Lovato's biological father who died in 2013.[11] The song was co-written by Lovato and Swedish musician Laleh Pourkarim who also produced the song and contributed on the background vocals. Lovato said that recording the song was therapeutic in a way, and helped her reconcile her conflicting emotions. "To know that it wasn't really his fault really was saddening to me," Lovato continued. "I wanted to write about it. I wanted to process it, and 'Father' really helped me do that."[12] Lovato and Pourkarim with Gustaf Thörn also co-wrote "Stone Cold" and "Yes".[8] The musician Jason Evigan wrote and produced "Old Ways" with Olivia Waithe and additional production by Scott Hoffman (credited Babydaddy).[8] "Kingdom Come" was co-written by Steve Mac, Julia Michaels and the Australian rapper Iggy Azalea who features guest appearance on the song. In an interview with MTV News, Lovato explained how her collaboration came together – and how Azalea knew exactly what to do without any idea what the song sounded like. "When we finally made the decision of which songs were making the album I said, 'OK, I want her on this one.' So I called her and was like, 'Hey will you do a song?' And she's like, 'Yeah sure I'll go into the studio tonight,'" Lovato said. "I was like, 'Do you want to hear it first?' She's like, 'No it's cool.' I'm like, 'You're an amazing friend and I love you.'"[13] Mac also composed "Waitin for You" with Evigan, American rapper Sirah and Mitch Allan. He produced and played all keyboards in "Lionheart".[8] "Wildfire" was written by Ryan Tedder, and Nicole Morier and the Norwegian production team Stargate who produced the track.[14]

Lovato also expressed wishes to work with rapper Iggy Azalea on the album.[7]

Confident debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 98,000 units (77,000 in pure album sales), behind Pentatonix's self-titled album.[72] It has since sold over 1,000,000 copies in the country,[73] and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[47] In the United Kingdom, the album opened at number six on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Lovato's highest-charting album there at the time.[74]
The title track, "Confident", was released as the second single on September 18, 2015, with the album's pre-order and eventually peaked at number 21 in the US. The song peaked number 1 on US Hot Dance/Club Songs.[52] The music video for "Confident" was released on October 9, 2015, through Lovato's Vevo channel.[53] It went top 20 in the Czech Republic as well as top 30 in Canada, Scotland, New Zealand and Slovakia.[54][55] The track was certified triple platinum in the United States.[47]

Glenn Gamboa from Newsday gave a more positive review, saying, "On Confident, Lovato's swaggering search for self is remarkably revealing, as she tackles everything from sexual experimentation to mental health issues to her relationship with her estranged father."[34] Writing for Billboard, Maura Johnston gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying, "[Lovato's] willingness to own every step and misstep, and to show her audience how the rough times helped her become the woman she is, makes Confident a surprisingly compelling listen."[61] Tim Stack from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, saying, "Over 11 tracks Lovato's energy is unwavering, sometimes to a fault. So it's a welcome relief that she takes a moment to reveal a softer side on the gospel-tinged ballad "Father," a tear-jerking tribute to her estranged late dad."[62] Richard Godwin from the Evening Standard gave the album a negative review, saying, "[Lovato's] more at home on the ballads such as Lionheart, while Kingdom Come, an atmospheric prowl featuring Iggy Azalea, all moody changes and trap beats, is a welcome respite from a personality record weirdly lacking in personality."[63] Patrick Ryan from USA Today gave the album 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying, "Confident is overall an assured step forward for Lovato, who should only hone her sound and style by the time album No. 6 rolls around."[66]

After releasing her fourth studio album Demi in May 2013,[3] Lovato confirmed in February 2014 that she was working on her fifth studio effort, stating, "The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." Lovato also said, "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist when it comes down to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do."[4] The following October, Lovato's then-manager confirmed to Billboard that she had "done some songs, but certainly the majority of it will kick off next year", following her Demi World Tour.[5]

For Confident, Lovato worked with music producers such as Max Martin, Ilya Salmanzadeh, Ali Payami, Jason Evigan, Johan Carlsson, Steve Mac, Stargate, Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Babydaddy and Peter Carlsson.[8] Discussing the album's direction, Lovato told Ryan Seacrest that "I'm no longer serious", stating: "I'm done with the sob stories. New chapter, new life, new album, new single — this is a completely new Demi." She also revealed that it would feature "a lot of provocative songs".[9] The first songs "Confident" and "Cool for the Summer" among with "Stars" and "Mr. Hughes" were recorded at MXM Studios, Chalice Studios, Westlake Audio Studios in Los Angeles, California and Wolf Cousins Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm. Lovato co-wrote both tracks with Martin, Kotecha, Alexander Erik, Payami and Salmazadeh. The horn arrangement from "Confident" was provided by musician Jonas Thander. The songs were both mixed by Serban Ghenea and mastered by Tom Coyne. Others songs of the album also were recorded at Rokstone Studios and The Hide Out Studios in London, United Kingdom.[8] "For You" was one of the first songs recorded for the album, describing how it was working with the producer Max Martin in the song's production, Lovato revealed, "I was just so excited to get to work with Max Martin on this song and his camp. I was so nervous when I went in. I wanted to put my everything into that performance because I knew that I was given the opportunity that I waited for for so many years to be able to work with somebody like him."[10]

On February 4, 2014, it was announced that Nick Jonas would be working as the Musical and Creative Director for the tour. Jonas told Rolling Stone "I'm overseeing video content, wardrobe, lighting, and staging, and then I'm extending into the musical side of things, which includes creating the arrangements for the songs. I'm building what Demi wanted, which is a show without stops and starts. Demi and I have the same manager, so I was immediately excited when I was offered the position. The relationship that Demi and I had over eight years really gives me the insight into how to best communicate with her and her team."I've been in rehearsals with the band for the last two weeks. The biggest challenge has been just trying to rethink some of the music and see how we could complement it with lights and video. I sat down with the band and said to them, 'You need to step into this like it's a new gig. None of these arrangements are going to sound like the originals, so you need to have an open mind.'"[6]
The encore begins with video content showing the media response to Lovato being admitted to rehab in 2010. This is followed by highlights of her success since her recovery, and when the video concludes, Lovato enters the stage. This is the only outfit change of the show, with Lovato wearing a long black dress to sing "Skyscraper". At the final chorus Lovato is lifted off the stage on a platform, a series of spotlights directed upon her. Lovato closes the show by ripping theur dress off to reveal the outfit that she wore for the rest of the show, and putting on a leather jacket to sing the final song, "Give Your Heart a Break". Overall the concert uses significant amounts of pyrotechnics, lighting, and video content; with little choreography allowing Demi to use the stage in her signature rock style.[8]

The concert began with an opening underwater video sequence of Lovato, shown on the stage screens, accompanied with a black stage. The film showed heart beats, suggesting the opening song of "Heart Attack". At the end of the underwater video, shots of the "Heart Attack" video begin to appear, Lovato singing the opening lines, before rising up out of the stage, surrounded by jets of steam, and going on to sing "Heart Attack". "Remember December" is performed with an accompanying music video showing Lovato surrounded by snow, in a winter environment. The song is based on a brand new arrangement, with white stage lighting and strobe effects. "Fire Starter" sees the stage lit up with fire effects, while "The Middle" begins with Lovato playing a set of drums, before kicking off into the also newly arranged song, an accompanying video showing Lovato in a desert. "Really Don't Care" begins with Lovato leaning up against the lead guitarist center stage. The stage is then lit up in bright pink and blue to match the song's 'girl power' vibe. The stage is bathed in blue lights while Lovato slows down with renditions of "Stop the World", "Catch Me", and "Here We Go Again". These see Lovato play the guitar, and at certain US concerts she is joined by Nick Jonas, who accompanies her with a duet.
This set list is representative of the performance in East Rutherford on March 7, 2014. It does not represent all concerts for the duration of the tour.[15]

Jason Lipshutz from Billboard called the show "a highly enjoyable evening", and found the performance of "Neon Lights" to be the show's "most memorable moment". He also referred to the opening video for "Skyscraper" as being "A candid, surprisingly affecting montage."[9] Mary Diaz from 99.7 NOW praised the show as "MORE than worth the wait!", deeming it "jam packed with talent, beauty, amazing voices, beautiful stage sets, and magic."[10] Mike Wass from Idolator called the show "flashy yet strikingly intimate", stating "there was no choreography and only one costume change, but you don't need shiny distractions when you can belt out songs like Demi and connect with the crowd on such an emotional level. That's not to say that the production was boring. Far from it."[11] Maychelle Ornos from International Business Times called the tour "epic" and "something to look forward to because Demi has taken all the steps to please and wow her fans."[12]Kayla Ziadie of Sun-Sentinel also gave a positive review, feeling the show "truly began" with Lovato's performance of "Heart Attack".[13] Jim Harrington from San Jose Mercury News gave a negative review, criticizing Lovato's live vocals and calling the show "just barely interesting enough to keep one's attention."[14]

On September 27, 2013, a video was published on Lovato's Facebook page with the words "Neon Lights" formed out of neon lights and at the end, it said: "Sunday 6PM EDT".[1][2] On the following Sunday, the Neon Lights Tour was announced along with the dates. The tour is named after the third single from the album Demi, "Neon Lights". Fifth Harmony, Little Mix, Cher Lloyd, and magician Collins Key were featured as opening acts. Tickets became available on October 5, 2013.[3] During the season finale of The X Factor 2013, Lovato announced her plans to leave the show, instead endeavoring to focus on music and touring for 2014. When asked about her plans for the tour, Lovato stated "You can expect a show that I've never put on before, I'm really excited. Other shows I've had have been all about the music, but this time I want it to be about girl empowerment, I want it to be a huge party that everyone has fun at and leaves with an incredible experience." In the same interview, she teased about a possible cover collaboration on the tour with the girls of Fifth Harmony.[4] Upon another interview Demi stated she had been working with longtime friend Nick Jonas on the show, stating "He's helping create the show for my tour next year, today we were talking about designs and music and how we can really make my show incredible and like nothing I've done.[5]

Prior to beginning off the tour, Lovato released a teaser video on her YouTube channel displaying video content that would be used during the show. Nick Jonas told MTV News: "there's a lot of exclusive content for this tour. Demi came to the whole team just on the creative side — both video and music, and she said, 'I want to give fans something special for every bit of the show.'" Lovato went on to comment that one of her inspirations for the tour was Beyoncé, stating "I was also really inspired by Beyoncé, who had a music video for every single song on the album. Some of these I had music video ideas for a while, and I'm excited for people to see it." In the same interview, both Jonas and Lovato went on to describe the "re-imagining" of Lovato's older songs, saying she went online to see what her fans wanted to hear, and what Lovato had played on her last two tours. Jonas commented that "a lot of these songs aren't even the original arrangements. They've been completely re-imagined." Lovato also went on to say, "we've made them more current too, so we've transformed songs that went from being made a couple years ago to actually sounding like today's music."[7]

"Here We Go Again" is the most significantly changed song, made into a slow, sultry rock song. Lovato goes on to play "Made in the USA", "Nightingale", and "Two Pieces." At the end of "Two Pieces" Lovato heads down into the crowd, where she performs among the audience. At this point there is a guitar solo. "Warrior" sees Lovato strip down, playing the piano, an accompanying music video of her clad in armor being shown. Before this song Lovato gives a signature speech to each city, making it one of the most personal part of the concert. "Let It Go" is performed as a pop rock song, and at the end of "Don't Forget", a video montage is shown of Lovato's musical journey, displaying various music videos of her songs. She then breaks into "Got Dynamite" after saying "that was me throughout the years..... and then..... I grew up." "Unbroken" and "Neon Lights" are both the club style song of the tour, with Cole Plante joining as a guest DJ on the US shows. During "Neon Lights", fans are able to use their phones on the Demi Lovato Official App, where they light up in time with each other, the stage is lit with Neon Lights, with an accompanying video being shown. During the choruses, steam it blown at around the stage, and strobe lights are shone out. As the song closes Lovato is lowered back into the stage, confetti being blown around the arena.

Artists often choose songs that are more up-tempo, yet representative of the album's sound, as lead singles.Such songs are often catchier and attract the attention of listeners. The subsequent single might then be slower in tempo, in order to demonstrate the range of the album. Female vocalists like Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera often maintain a formula of an up-tempo first lead single with a slow ballad follow-up. For example, two singles were released by Miley Cyrus before her album Bangerz – an up-tempo track called, "We Can't Stop" was released as the first, and a slow-ballad song, "Wrecking Ball" as the second. This was a successful practice of 1980s heavy metal bands. Girls Aloud chose to use "The Show", a dance-pop and electropop song, as their lead single for their second album, What Will the Neighbours Say?, following the fact that their previous singles from their debut album Sound of the Underground were "quite down and moody"[citation needed] according to band member Cheryl. However, not all artists decide to choose their lead single with the up-tempo criteria. Artists may release a lead single that has a message they want to convey to listeners instead of a song with more commercial potential, such as Fall Out Boy who chose to release "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" over the radio-friendly "Thnks fr th Mmrs".[1]
Japanese artists such as Ayumi Hamasaki, Namie Amuro and B'z may release four to eight singles before their albums to achieve record-breaking debut-week sales. The lead singles in Japan are very heavily advertised and promoted, in some cases even more than the album itself. With album sales continuously declining in the United States, record labels often release singles before the album's release date to online music retailers including iTunes, ranging in price from $0.99 to $1.29. This trend has become increasingly popular in many markets.[citation needed]

A lead single (also known as a debut single) is the first single to be released from a studio album by an artist or a band, usually before the album itself is released and also occasionally on the same day of the album's release date.
In the 2000s, a common trend developed to release a lead single months in advance of the album release date. It has equally become common for further singles to be released before the release of the album. For example, Usher issued the lead single "Love in This Club" four months before the May 29, 2008, release of Here I Stand. The second single "Love in This Club Part II" was released one month before the album release date. Another example is Justin Timberlake's 2013 album, The 20/20 Experience, which was released on March 19, 2013. The first single off it is "Suit & Tie", released 2 months before the album hit stores. One month before the release of the album, another single called "Mirrors" was released.[3] Katy Perry released "California Gurls" as a single on May 7, 2010, and "Teenage Dream" on July 23, 2010, leading to the release of the album Teenage Dream on August 24, 2010. Ed Sheeran did something similar, releasing both "Shape of You" and "Castle on the Hill" as double lead singles from his album ÷, although these songs were both released on the same day, 6 January 2017.[4]
"Why Your Favorite Artist Is Releasing More Singles Than Ever"
In the late 2010s, artists began a trend of releasing multiple singles before eventually releasing a studio album. An unnamed A&R representative confirmed to Rolling Stone in 2018 that "an artist hasto build a foundation to sustain" and adding that "When artists have one big record and go run with that, it doesn't work because they never had a foundation to begin with." The same article cited examples such as Cardi B, Camila Cabello and Jason Derulo releasing four or more singles before their album releases.[2]

The video takes place in a suburban neighborhood where Lovato and Marshmello both wake up in bedrooms that belong to the younger versions of themselves. Lovato and their younger version both trash the bedroom, cutting between scenes of older Lovato singing in the center. Everyone eventually strolls around their neighborhood while singing and dancing to the song, and while Marshmello rolls around the front yard and rides his bike. The video ends with information about "Hope for the Day" and resources for suicide prevention.[10]

The song has been nominated in the 2010 Teen Choice Awards, as Teen Choice Hook-Up between the band and Lovato.
The song debuted at number 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, making the band's second entry on this chart. It has since peaked at number 76. As of October 2017, the song has sold 314,000 copies.[3]
The music video premiered on MTV on April 22, 2010 and was directed by Raul B. Fernandez. The video begins, as various teens prepare and as they head off to what appears to be a camp. At the camp, the band starts playing. During Lovato's verse, she walks through the teens as they throw pillows at each other. Later, the teens throw such things as a bucket of chocolate, Silly String, water balloons and toilet paper at each other. In the end, the teens are covered with their stuff. The video ends, as Lovato and Travis Clark, lead singer of the band, look at each other.

Forbes contributor Hugh McIntyre described "Sorry Not Sorry" as "an unapologetic, braggadocious look in the mirror, with Lovato taking the opportunity to praise herself, and rightfully so," and further opined that "Lovato really packs a punch with her powerful vocals, which have been setting her apart from other female pop stars for years now."[15] Elias Leight of Rolling Stone described the song as a "gleeful revenge on a callous ex" with "heavy rhythmic effects."[16] Christopher Rosa of Glamour felt the song "takes self-empowerment to new heights."[17] Lars Brandle of Billboard wrote it was "bound to be embraced as a girl-power anthem."[18] On a less positive note, Mike Wass from Idolator stated that its theme was something that had "been done several dozen times before," as the concept is a "fairly tired tale of turning the tables on an ex/hater," and felt the chorus "offers more of the same."[19]
"Watch Demi Lovato perform 'Sorry Not Sorry' live on TODAY". October 5, 2017.
Felder revealed to Songwriter Universe that the concept of the track was inspired by a phone conversation with his wife which Lovato "connected" to. "It connected specifically for her, because there's a lot of things in her past that people are looking for her to be apologetic for," he added.[6]

Lovato told Noisey that she had always wanted "Sorry Not Sorry" to be the lead single of Tell Me You Love Me but her inner circle felt the title track was a better choice "because it's emotional—it's vulnerable". Lovato then played both songs to the founder of Roc Nation, which her management Philymack was partnered with, Jay-Z. "And he said 'Sorry Not Sorry' because it was lighthearted. He was like, 'A lot of people see you do the emotional thing all the time, but they don't see you have fun!' And I was like, 'That's such a good point.' And [his opinion] kind of persuaded other people, too."[8]
