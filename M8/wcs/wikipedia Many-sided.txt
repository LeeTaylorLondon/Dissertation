A skew hexadecagon is a skew polygon with 24 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an hexadecagon is not generally defined. A skew zig-zag hexadecagon has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.

A regular hexadecagon is a hexadecagon in which all angles are equal and all sides are congruent. Its Schläfli symbol is {16} and can be constructed as a truncated octagon, t{8}, and a twice-truncated square tt{4}. A truncated hexadecagon, t{16}, is a triacontadigon, {32}.

The most common high symmetry hexadecagons are d16, an isogonal hexadecagon constructed by eight mirrors can alternate long and short edges, and p16, an isotoxal hexadecagon constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular hexadecagon.
In mathematics, a hexadecagon (sometimes called a hexakaidecagon or 16-gon) is a sixteen-sided polygon.[1]
Deeper truncations of the regular octagon and octagram can produce isogonal (vertex-transitive) intermediate hexadecagram forms with equally spaced vertices and two edge lengths.[5]

A hexadecagram is a 16-sided star polygon, represented by symbol {16/n}. There are three regular star polygons, {16/3}, {16/5}, {16/7}, using the same vertices, but connecting every third, fifth or seventh points. There are also three compounds: {16/2} is reduced to 2{8} as two octagons, {16/4} is reduced to 4{4} as four squares and {16/6} reduces to 2{8/3} as two octagrams, and finally {16/8} is reduced to 8{2} as eight digons.
In the early 16th century, Raphael was the first to construct a perspective image of a regular hexadecagon: the tower in his painting The Marriage of the Virgin has 16 sides, elaborating on an eight-sided tower in a previous painting by Pietro Perugino.[6]
The regular hexadecagon has Dih16 symmetry, order 32. There are 4 dihedral subgroups: Dih8, Dih4, Dih2, and Dih1, and 5 cyclic subgroups: Z16, Z8, Z4, Z2, andZ1, the last implying no symmetry.
The regular hexadecagon is the Petrie polygon for many higher-dimensional polytopes, shown in these skew orthogonal projections, including:
On the regular hexadecagon, there are 14 distinct symmetries. John Conway labels full symmetry as r32 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars) Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.[3]
Each angle of a regular hexadecagon is 157.5 degrees, and the total angle measure of any hexadecagon is 2520 degrees.
Because the hexadecagon has a number of sides that is a power of two, its area can be computed in terms of the circumradius R by truncating Viète's formula:

An octagonal star can be seen as a concave hexadecagon:
A truncated octagon is a hexadecagon, t{8}={16}. A quasitruncated octagon, inverted as {8/7}, is a hexadecagram: t{8/7}={16/7}. A truncated octagram {8/3} is a hexadecagram: t{8/3}={16/3} and a quasitruncated octagram, inverted as {8/5}, is a hexadecagram: t{8/5}={16/5}.

The area of a regular hexadecagon with edge length t is
Since the area of the circumcircle is πR2,{\displaystyle \pi R^{2},} the regular hexadecagon fills approximately 97.45% of its circumcircle.
A regular skew hexadecagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew hexadecagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of an octagonal antiprism with the same D8d, [2+,16] symmetry, order 32. The octagrammic antiprism, s{2,16/3} and octagrammic crossed-antiprism, s{2,16/5} also have regular skew octagons.
Hexadecagrams (16-sided star polygons) are included in the Girih patterns in the Alhambra.[7]
Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g16 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.

A realization of an abstract apeirogon is defined as a mapping from its vertices to a finite-dimensional geometric space (typically a Euclidean space) such that every symmetry of the abstract apeirogon corresponds to an isometry of the images of the mapping.[3]: 121 [4]: 225  Two realizations are called congruent if the natural bijection between their sets of vertices is induced by an isometry of their ambient Euclidean spaces.[3]: 126 [4]: 229  The classical definition of an apeirogon as an equally-spaced subdivision of the Euclidean line is a realization in this sense, as is the convex subset in the hyperbolic plane formed by the convex hull of equally-spaced points on a horocycle.[5] Other realizations are possible in higher-dimensional spaces.
A regular apeirogon can be defined as a partition of the Euclidean line E1 into infinitely many equal-length segments. It generalizes the regular n-gon, which may be defined as a partition of the circle S1 into finitely many equal-length segments.[2]

The realizations of two-dimensional abstract polytopes (including both polygons and apeirogons), in Euclidean spaces of at most three dimensions, can be classified into six types:
McMullen, Peter (1994), "Realizations of regular apeirotopes", Aequationes Mathematicae, 47 (2–3): 223–239, doi:10.1007/BF01832961, MR 1268033
For abstract polytopes of rank 2, this means that: A) the elements of the partially ordered set are sets of vertices with either zero vertex (the empty set), one vertex, two vertices (an edge), or the entire vertex set (a two-dimensional face), ordered by inclusion of sets; B) each vertex belongs to exactly two edges; C) the undirected graph formed by the vertices and edges is connected.[3]: 22–25 [4]: 224
Abstract apeirogons may be realized in all of these ways, in some cases mapping infinitely many different vertices of an abstract apeirogon onto finitely many points of the realization. An apeirogon also admits star polygon realizations and antiprismatic realizations with a non-discrete set of infinitely many points.

Generally, the moduli space of realizations of an abstract polytope is a convex cone of infinite dimension.[3]: 127 [4]: 229–230  The realization cone of the abstract apeirogon has uncountably infinite algebraic dimension and cannot be closed in the Euclidean topology.[3]: 141 [4]: 232

The regular pseudogon is a partition of the hyperbolic line H1 (instead of the Euclidean line) into segments of length 2λ, as an analogue of the regular apeirogon.[2]
An abstract polytope is called an abstract apeirotope if it has infinitely many elements; an abstract 2-apeirotope is called an abstract apeirogon.[3]: 25
Given a point A0 in a Euclidean space and a translation S, define the point Ai to be the point obtained from i applications of the translation S to A0, so Ai = Si(A0). The set of vertices Ai with i any integer, together with edges connecting adjacent vertices, is a sequence of equal-length segments of a line, and is called the regular apeirogon as defined by H. S. M. Coxeter.[1]

Apeirohedra are the 3-dimensional analogues of apeirogons, and are the infinite analogues of polyhedra.[7] More generally, n-apeirotopes or infinite n-polytopes are the n-dimensional analogues of apeirogons, and are the infinite analogues of n-polytopes.[3]: 22–25
In an abstract polytope, a flag is a collection of one face of each dimension, all incident to each other (that is, comparable in the partial order); an abstract polytope is called regular if it has symmetries (structure-preserving permutations of its elements) that take any flag to any other flag. In the case of a two-dimensional abstract polytope, this is automatically true; the symmetries of the apeirogon form the infinite dihedral group.[3]: 31
In geometry, an apeirogon (from Ancient Greek.mw-parser-output .noitalic{font-style:normal}ἄπειρος apeiros 'infinite, boundless', andγωνία gonia 'angle') or infinite polygon is a polygon with an infinite number of sides. Apeirogons are the two-dimensional case of infinite polytopes. In some literature, the term "apeirogon" may refer only to the regular apeirogon, with an infinite dihedral group of symmetries.[1]

An abstract polytope is a partially ordered set P (whose elements are called faces) with properties modeling those of the inclusions of faces of convex polytopes. The rank (or dimension) of an abstract polytope is determined by the length of the maximal ordered chains of its faces, and an abstract polytope of rank n is called an abstract n-polytope.[3]: 22–25
The infinite dihedral group G of symmetries of a realization V of an abstract apeirogon P is generated by two reflections, the product of which translates each vertex of P to the next.[3]: 140–141 [4]: 231  The product of the two reflections can be decomposed as a product of a non-zero translation, finitely many rotations, and a possibly trivial reflection.[3]: 141 [4]: 231

The result differs from the area of its circumscribed circle by up to 40 parts per billion.
In geometry, a myriagon or 10000-gon is a polygon with 10000 sides. Several philosophers have used the regular myriagon to illustrate issues regarding thought.[1][2][3][4][5]
A myriagram is a 10,000-sided star polygon. There are 1999 regular forms[a] given by Schläfli symbols of the form {10000/n}, where n is an integer between 2 and 5,000 that is coprime to 10,000. There are also 3000 regular star figures in the remaining cases.

The regular myriagon has Dih10000 dihedral symmetry, order 20000, represented by 10000 lines of reflection. Dih10000 has 24 dihedral subgroups: (Dih5000, Dih2500, Dih1250, Dih625), (Dih2000, Dih1000, Dih500, Dih250, Dih125), (Dih400, Dih200, Dih100, Dih50, Dih25), (Dih80, Dih40, Dih20, Dih10, Dih5), and (Dih16, Dih8, Dih4, Dih2, Dih1). It also has 25 more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z10000, Z5000, Z2500, Z1250, Z625), (Z2000, Z1000, Z500, Z250, Z125), (Z400, Z200, Z100, Z50, Z25), (Z80, Z40, Z20, Z10), and (Z16, Z8, Z4, Z2, Z1), with Zn representing π/n radian rotational symmetry.

The measure of each internal angle in a regular myriagon is 179.964°. The area of a regular myriagon with sides of length a is given by
^ 5000 cases - 1 (convex) - 1,000 (multiples of 5) - 2,500 (multiples of 2)+ 500 (multiples of 2 and 5)
John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.[6] r20000 represents full symmetry, and a1 labels no symmetry.He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry.
In the novella Flatland, the Chief Circle is assumed to have ten thousand sides, making him a myriagon.
^ Paolo Fabiani, The philosophy of the imagination in Vico and Malebranche: p. 222
A regular myriagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {10,000} and can be constructed as a truncated 5000-gon, t{5000}, or a twice-truncated 2500-gon, tt{2500}, or a thrice-truncated 1250-gon, ttt{1250), or a four-fold-truncated 625-gon, tttt{625}.
Because 10,000 = 24 × 54, the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Fermat primes nor a power of two. Thus the regular myriagon is not a constructible polygon. Indeed, it is not even constructible with the use of an angle trisector, as the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Pierpont primes, nor a product of powers of two and three.

The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }/nZ{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }, i.e., to Hol(Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }/nZ{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1}and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, ..., n − 1 coprime to n.
All the reflections are conjugate to each other whenever n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.

If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane.This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication.This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).

The orthogonal group O(2), i.e., the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.

For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

In general, the group Dn has elements r0, ..., rn−1 and s0, ..., sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups.It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle).r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.

In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.

3The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, ... , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, ... ,rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections, in each case acting on the stop sign with the orientation as shown at the top left.

It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.
Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
For n > 2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[7][8][9]
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! forn = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.

As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object.With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.[6]

The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).

D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.

In general, the matrices for elements of Dn have the following form:
The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2.Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }m. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n.See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
The notation for the dihedral group differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, D2n refers to this same dihedral group.[3] This article uses the geometric convention, Dn.

Coxeter expanded his usage of the Schläfli symbol to quasiregular polyhedra by adding a vertical dimension to the symbol. It was a starting point toward the more general Coxeter diagram. Norman Johnson simplified the notation for vertical symbols with an r prefix. The t-notation is the most general, and directly corresponds to the rings of the Coxeter diagram. Symbols have a corresponding alternation, replacing rings withholes in a Coxeter diagram and h prefix standing for half, construction limited by the requirement that neighboring branches must be even-ordered and cuts the symmetry order in half. A related operator, a for altered, is shown with two nested holes, represents a compound polyhedra with both alternated halves, retaining the original full symmetry. A snub is a half form of a truncation, and a holosnub is both halves of an alternated truncation.

The Schläfli symbol can represent a finite convex polyhedron, an infinite tessellation of Euclidean space, or an infinite tessellation of hyperbolic space, depending on the angle defect of the construction. A positive angle defect allows the vertex figure to fold into a higher dimension and loops back into itself as a polytope. A zero angle defect tessellates space of the same dimension as the facets. A negative angle defect cannot exist in ordinary space, but can be constructed in hyperbolic space.

In 3D, a p-gonal bipyramid, is represented as { } + {p}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [2,p].
The Schläfli symbol is named after the 19th-century Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli,[1]: 143  who generalized Euclidean geometry to more than three dimensions and discovered all their convex regular polytopes, including the six that occur in four dimensions.
Axial polytopes containing vertices on parallel offset hyperplanes can be represented by the || operator. A uniform prism is {n}||{n} and antiprism {n}||r{n}.
Pyramidal polytopes containing vertices orthogonally offset can be represented using a join operator, "∨". Every pair of vertices between joined figures are connected by edges.
In addition to describing Euclidean polytopes, Schläfli symbols can be used to describe spherical polytopes or spherical honeycombs.[1]: 138
Gosset's form has greater symmetry, so the number of dimensions is the number of vertical bars, and the symbol exactly includes the sub-symbols for facet and vertex figure. Gosset regarded | p as an operator, which can be applied to | q | ... | z | to produce a polytope with p-gonal faces whose vertex figure is | q | ... | z |.
A regular polytope also has a dual polytope, represented by the Schläfli symbol elements in reverse order. A self-dual regular polytope will have a symmetric Schläfli symbol.
The Schläfli symbol of a (convex) regular polygon with p edges is {p}. For example, a regular pentagon is represented by {5}.
See the six convex regular and 10 regular star 4-polytopes.
In 4D, a {p,q}-hedral bipyramid is represented as { } + {p,q}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [p,q].
The Schläfli symbol of a regular polyhedron is {p,q} if its faces are p-gons, and each vertex is surrounded by q faces (the vertex figure is a q-gon).

(1973). Regular Polytopes (3rd ed.). New York: Dover.
In general, a regular polytope {p,q,r,...,y,z} has z {p,q,r,...,y} facets around every peak, where a peak is a vertex in a polyhedron, an edge in a 4-polytope, a face in a 5-polytope, and an (n-3)-face in an n-polytope.
For example, the 120-cell is represented by {5,3,3}. It is made of dodecahedron cells {5,3}, and has 3 cells around each edge.
A regular polyhedron that has q regular p-sided polygon faces around each vertex is represented by {p,q}. For example, the cube has 3 squares around each vertex and is represented by {4,3}.
If the sequence is palindromic, i.e. the same forwards and backwards, the polytope is self-dual. Every regular polytope in 2 dimensions (polygon) is self-dual.
For (nonconvex) star polygons, the constructive notation {p⁄q} is used, where p is the number of vertices and q−1 is the number of vertices skipped when drawing each edge of the star. For example, {5⁄2} represents the pentagram.
In 2D, an isosceles triangle can be represented as ( ) ∨ { } = ( ) ∨ [( ) ∨ ( )].

In geometry, the Schläfli symbol is a notation of the form {p,q,r,...}{\displaystyle \{p,q,r,...\}} that defines regular polytopes and tessellations.
See the 5 convex Platonic solids, the 4 nonconvex Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.
In 2D, a rectangle is represented as { } × { }. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [2].
The Schläfli symbol of a regular 4-polytope is of the form {p,q,r}. Its (two-dimensional) faces are regular p-gons ({p}), the cells are regular polyhedra of type {p,q}, the vertex figures areregular polyhedra of type {q,r}, and the edge figures are regular r-gons (type {r}).
There are also 4 regular compact hyperbolic tessellations including {5,3,4}, the hyperbolic small dodecahedral honeycomb, which fills space with dodecahedron cells.
In 4D, a p-q duopyramid is represented as {p} + {q}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [p,2,q].
Alternations have half the symmetry of the Coxeter groups and are represented by unfilled rings. There are two choices possible on which half of vertices are taken, but the symbol doesn't imply which one. Quarter forms are shown here with a + inside a hollow ring to imply they are two independent alternations.

Schläfli symbols are closely related to (finite) reflection symmetry groups, which correspond precisely to the finite Coxeter groups and are specified with the same indices, but square brackets instead [p,q,r,...]. Such groups are often named by the regular polytopes they generate. For example, [3,3] is the Coxeter group for reflective tetrahedral symmetry, [3,4] is reflective octahedral symmetry, and [3,5] is reflective icosahedral symmetry.

A regular polytope has a regular vertex figure. The vertex figure of a regular polytope {p,q,r,...,y,z} is {q,r,...,y,z}.
Topologically, a regular 2-dimensional tessellation may be regarded as similar to a (3-dimensional) polyhedron, but such that the angular defect is zero. Thus, Schläfli symbols may also be defined for regular tessellations of Euclidean or hyperbolic space in a similar way as for polyhedra. The analogy holds for higher dimensions.
Regular star polygons are not convex, and their Schläfli symbols {p/q} contain irreducible fractions p/q, where p is the number of vertices, and q is their turning number. Equivalently, {p/q} is created from the vertices of {p}, connected every q. For example, {.mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}5⁄2} is a pentagram; {5⁄1} is a pentagon.

When mixing operators, the order of operations from highest to lowest is ×, +, ∨.
A truncated regular polygon doubles in sides. A regular polygon with even sides can be halved. An altered even-sided regular 2n-gon generates a star figure compound, 2{n}.
Altered and holosnubbed forms have the full symmetry of the Coxeter group, and are represented by double unfilled rings, but may be represented as compounds.
Uniform prismatic polytopes can be defined and named as a Cartesian product (with operator "×") of lower-dimensional regular polytopes.
In 3D, a p-gonal prism is represented as { } × {p}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [2,p].
The Schläfli symbol is a recursive description,[1]: 129  starting with {p} for a p-sided regular polygon that is convex. For example, {3} is an equilateral triangle, {4} is a square, {5} a convex regular pentagon, etc.
If a polytope of dimension n ≥ 2 has Schläfli symbol {p1,p2, ..., pn − 1} then its dualhas Schläfli symbol {pn − 1, ..., p2,p1}.
Regular polytopes can have star polygon elements, like the pentagram, with symbol {5⁄2}, represented by the vertices of a pentagon but connected alternately.
For higher-dimensional regular polytopes, the Schläfli symbol is defined recursively as {p1, p2,...,pn − 1} if the facets have Schläfli symbol {p1,p2,...,pn − 2} and the vertex figures have Schläfli symbol {p2,p3,...,pn − 1}.
Usually, a facet or a vertex figure is assumed to be a finite polytope, but can sometimes itself be considered a tessellation.
Schläfli's work was almost unknown in his lifetime, and his notation for describing polytopes was rediscovered independently by several others. In particular, Thorold Gosset rediscovered the Schläfli symbol which he wrote as | p | q | r | ... | z | rather than with brackets and commas as Schläfli did.[1]: 144

In 1995, Weisstein converted a Microsoft Word document of over 200 pages to hypertext format and uploaded it to his webspace at Caltech under the title Eric's Treasure Trove of Sciences. After Weisstein transferred to the University of Virginia to continue his work in astronomy, he continued to refine his fledgling encyclopedia. In November 1998, Weisstein made a deal with the CRC Press to publish his encyclopedia in book format as the CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics. A year later, in 1999, Weisstein accepted the position of encyclopedist at Wolfram Research, Inc. (WRI). MathWorld was ready to be unveiled in December 1999 with nearly 13,000 entries, most of them written by Weisstein, encompassing a variety of disciplines, including algebra, geometry, calculus, discrete mathematics, topology, number theory, statistics, and the foundations.

Another three-dimensional version of the octagram is the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron (quasirhombicuboctahedron), which can be thought of as a quasicantellated (quasiexpanded) cube, t0,2{4/3,3}.
Deeper truncations of the square can produce isogonal (vertex-transitive) intermediate star polygon forms with equal spaced vertices and two edge lengths. A truncated square is an octagon, t{4}={8}. A quasitruncated square, inverted as {4/3}, is an octagram, t{4/3}={8/3}.[2]
There are two regular octagrammic star figures (compounds) of the form {8/k}, the first constructed as two squares {8/2}=2{4}, and second as four degenerate digons, {8/4}=4{2}. There are other isogonal and isotoxal compounds including rectangular and rhombic forms.
The name octagram combine a Greek numeral prefix, octa-, with theGreek suffix -gram. The -gram suffix derives from γραμμή (grammḗ) meaning "line".[1]

A myriagram is a 10,000-sided star polygon. There are 1999 regular forms[a] given by Schläfli symbols of the form {10000/n}, where n is an integer between 2 and 5,000 that is coprime to 10,000. There are also 3000 regular star figures in the remaining cases.

The regular myriagon has Dih10000 dihedral symmetry, order 20000, represented by 10000 lines of reflection. Dih10000 has 24 dihedral subgroups: (Dih5000, Dih2500, Dih1250, Dih625), (Dih2000, Dih1000, Dih500, Dih250, Dih125), (Dih400, Dih200, Dih100, Dih50, Dih25), (Dih80, Dih40, Dih20, Dih10, Dih5), and (Dih16, Dih8, Dih4, Dih2, Dih1). It also has 25 more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z10000, Z5000, Z2500, Z1250, Z625), (Z2000, Z1000, Z500, Z250, Z125), (Z400, Z200, Z100, Z50, Z25), (Z80, Z40, Z20, Z10), and (Z16, Z8, Z4, Z2, Z1), with Zn representing π/n radian rotational symmetry.
5000 cases - 1 (convex) - 1,000 (multiples of 5) - 2,500 (multiples of 2)+ 500 (multiples of 2 and 5)
The measure of each internal angle in a regular myriagon is 179.964°. The area of a regular myriagon with sides of length a is given by
^ 5000 cases - 1 (convex) - 1,000 (multiples of 5) - 2,500 (multiples of 2)+ 500 (multiples of 2 and 5)
John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.[6] r20000 represents full symmetry, and a1 labels no symmetry.He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry.
In the novella Flatland, the Chief Circle is assumed to have ten thousand sides, making him a myriagon.
^ Paolo Fabiani, The philosophy of the imagination in Vico and Malebranche: p. 222
A regular myriagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {10,000} and can be constructed as a truncated 5000-gon, t{5000}, or a twice-truncated 2500-gon, tt{2500}, or a thrice-truncated 1250-gon, ttt{1250), or a four-fold-truncated 625-gon, tttt{625}.
Because 10,000 = 24 × 54, the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Fermat primes nor a power of two. Thus the regular myriagon is not a constructible polygon. Indeed, it is not even constructible with the use of an angle trisector, as the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Pierpont primes, nor a product of powers of two and three.

Since DOI is a namespace within the Handle System, it is semantically correct to represent it as the URI info:doi/10.1000/182.
A DOI aims to resolve to its target, the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL where the object is located. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from ISBNs or ISRCs which are identifiers only. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata.

An alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,[34] which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.

A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify various objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).[1] DOIs are an implementation of the Handle System;[2][3] they also fit within the URI system (Uniform Resource Identifier). They are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications. DOIs have also been used to identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.

The CrossRef recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyperlinked to its appropriate URL – the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.[20]
Registration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a not-for-profit cost recovery basis.
A DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.[29]

Contrary to the DOI Handbook, CrossRef, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, https://doi.org/10.1000/182) instead of the officially specified format (for example, doi:10.1000/182)[17][18] This URL is persistent (there is a contract that ensures persistence in the DOI.ORG domain), so it is a PURL – providing the location of an HTTP proxy server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item.[9][19]

The DOI syntax is a NISO standard, first standardised in 2000, ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2005 Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier.[41]
A DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a Uniform Resource Name (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.

URN architecture assumes a DNS-based Resolution Discovery Service (RDS) to find the service appropriate to the given URN scheme. However no such widely deployed RDS schemes currently exist.... DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System. It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string urn:doi:10.1000/1 rather than the simpler doi:10.1000/1) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution. If RDS mechanisms supporting URN specifications become widely available, DOI will be registered as a URN.

The names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model.

Other DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include the Handle System and PANGAEA. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a non-paywalled (often author archived) version of a title and redirects the user to that instead of the publisher's version.[31][32] Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016[33] (later Unpaywall). While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).[31][33]
The DOI system offers persistent, semantically interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as "identifiers" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other "identifier systems" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).

Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level 10 prefix.[36]

DOI name resolution is provided through the Handle System, developed by Corporation for National Research Initiatives, and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its  field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.

The IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of persistent identification, in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated (although when the publisher of a journal changes, sometimes all the DOIs will be changed, with the old DOIs no longer working). It also associates metadata with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure.
Another approach, which avoids typing or cutting-and-pasting into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as https://doi.org/ (preferred)[30] or http://dx.doi.org/, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI 10.1000/182 can be included in a reference or hyperlink as https://doi.org/10.1000/182. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.

The Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the URI specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on open architectures, incorporates trust mechanisms, and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.[25] DOI name-resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.[26] However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents, that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.[27]

For example, in the DOI name 10.1000/182, the prefix is 10.1000 and the suffix is 182. The "10" part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,[A] and the characters 1000 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. 182 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the DOI Handbook).

The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000.[8] Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs.[9] The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF.[10] By late April 2011 more than 50 million DOI names had been assigned by some 4,000 organizations,[11] and by April 2013 this number had grown to 85 million DOI names assigned through 9,500 organizations.
The DOI system is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.[37] The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation – Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval. The relevant ISO Working Group later submitted an edited version to ISO for distribution as an FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot,[38] which was approved by 100% of those voting in a ballot closing on 15 November 2010.[39] The final standard was published on 23 April 2012.[1]

The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI should provide a more stable link than directly using its URL. But if its URL changes, the publisher must update the metadata for the DOI to maintain the link to the URL.[4][5][6] It is the publisher's responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link, leaving the DOI useless.[7]
The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is at least a four digit number greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants.[12][13] The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.[14]

The indecs Content Model as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.

An icositrigon is not origami constructible either, because 23 is not a Pierpont prime, nor a power of two or three.[4] It can be constructed using the quadratrix of Hippias, Archimedean spiral, and other auxiliary curves; yet this is true for all regular polygons.[5]

The regular icositrigon is not constructible with a compass and straightedge or angle trisection,[1] on account of the number 23 being neither a Fermat nor Pierpont prime. In addition, the regular icositrigon is the smallest regular polygon that is not constructible even with neusis.
A regular icositrigon has internal angles of 378023{\textstyle {\frac {3780}{23}}} degrees, with an area of A=234a2cot⁡π23=23r2tan⁡π23≃41.8344a2,{\textstyle A={\frac {23}{4}}a^{2}\cot {\frac {\pi }{23}}=23r^{2}\tan {\frac {\pi }{23}}\simeq 41.8344\,a^{2},} where a{\displaystyle a} is side length and r{\displaystyle r} is the inradius, or apothem.
In geometry, an icositrigon (or icosikaitrigon) or 23-gon is a 23-sided polygon. The icositrigon has the distinction of being the smallest regular polygon that is not neusis constructible.
Concerning the nonconstructability of the regular icositrigon, A. Baragar (2002) showed it is not possible to construct a regular 23-gon using only a compass and twice-notched straightedge by demonstrating that every point constructible with said method lies in a tower of fields over Q{\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } such that Q=K0⊂K1⊂⋯⊂Kn=K{\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} =K_{0}\subset K_{1}\subset \dots \subset K_{n}=K}, being a sequence of nested fields in which the degree of the extension at each step is 2, 3, 5, or 6.

Below is a table of ten regular icositrigrams, or star 23-gons, labeled with their respective Schläfli symbol {23/q}, 2 ≤ q ≤ 11.
If we can construct the regular p-gon, then we can construct ζp=e2πip{\displaystyle \zeta _{p}=e^{\frac {2\pi i}{p}}}, which is the root of an irreducible polynomial of degree p−1{\displaystyle p-1}. By Theorem 5.1, ζp{\displaystyle \zeta _{p}} lies in a field K{\displaystyle K} of degree N{\displaystyle N} over Q{\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }, where the only primes that divide N{\displaystyle N} are 2, 3, and 5. But Q[ζp]{\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} [\zeta _{p}]} is a subfield of K{\displaystyle K}, so p−1{\displaystyle p-1} divides N{\displaystyle N}. In particular, for p=23{\displaystyle p=23}, N{\displaystyle N} must be divisible by 11, and for p=29{\displaystyle p=29}, N must be divisible by 7.[2]
This result establishes, considering prime-power regular polygons below the 100-gon, that it is impossible to construct the 23-, 29-, 43-, 47-, 49-, 53-, 59-, 67-, 71-, 79-, 83-, and 89-gons with neusis. But it is not strong enough to decide the cases of the 11-, 25-, 31-, 41-, and 61-gons. Elliot Benjamin and Chip Snyder discovered in 2014 that the regular hendecagon (11-gon) is neusis constructible; the remaining cases are still open.[3]
