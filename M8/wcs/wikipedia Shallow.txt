Shallow returned as a "Favorite" and part of the Malakal tribe. She formed a close bond with James Clement and the two formed an alliance with another couple consisting of Amanda Kimmel and Ozzy Lusth. After their tribe lost the first Immunity Challenge, they tried swinging Jonny Fairplay over to their side to gain a majority over the alliance of Yau-Man Chan, Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Jonathan Penner. However, Fairplay was voted out instead as per his wishes, since he was aching to return home to his pregnant girlfriend. Shallow then made a pact with Cirie Fields to go all the way to the Final Three with Kimmel. After losing the third Immunity Challenge, Shallow was targeted by the opposing alliance, but her own alliance (now with Fields) succeeded in voting off strategic threat Chan.
In 2014, Shallow began dating fellow Survivor alum John Fincher, who competed on Survivor: Samoa. They announced their engagement in January 2017 and married on July 16, 2017.[22][23] They had a daughter in July 2018.[24] In August 2021, Shallow filed for divorce from Fincher after four years of marriage.[25] It was later revealed that Shallow had obtained a temporary domestic violence restraining order against Fincher.[26]

She beat out Hantz, who received zero votes, but was defeated by Diaz-Twine, who got the votes of all the Heroes, plus Yates, who was in an alliance with Diaz-Twine while still in the game. By the end of Heroes vs. Villains, Shallow had played a total of 114 days on Survivor, the most at that time.

At the tribal switch, Shallow and Clement were separated from their alliance as they moved to Airai. However, she remained safe as her tribe won the remaining tribal Immunity Challenges. On day 20, she made a deal with Natalie Bolton for an alliance with Clement and Alexis Jones, plus a Final Four deal with Jones and Kimmel; Bolton accepted both deals.

In the official issue of CBS Watch commemorating the 15th anniversary of Survivor, Shallow was voted by viewers as the fourth greatest contestant in the history of the series (only behind Cesternino, Hantz, and Mariano), and was the highest-ranking female contestant.[14] Also, she was the only three-time contestant in the top ten to have all three of her seasons also be ranked by viewers as among the top ten greatest seasons of all time—Cook Islands was ranked tenth, Micronesia was ranked third, and Heroes vs. Villains was ranked first.[15] In addition, she came in second in the same magazine's poll for the most attractive female contestant, only behind Brenda Lowe of Survivor: Nicaragua and Survivor: Caramoan.[16] Accordingly, Shallow was the only female contestant to appear in both polls, and one of only two contestants overall to appear in the "greatest players" poll and one of the "most attractive" polls, the other being Lusth, her fellow Cook Islands and Micronesia player. In 2017, Entertainment Weekly had fans of the series rank the 34 winners and Shallow came in 1st place.[17]
On day 25, the Heroes and Villains merged into Yin Yang and went to live at the old Heroes camp. Shallow and Hantz came up with this story that they both played their idol, negating all votes, and that in the re-vote, they eliminated Courtney Yates. The new tribe quickly alienated Shallow, making her swear to get revenge on all of the Heroes. For the immunity challenge on day 27, she and DiLorenzo were the last two remaining. Shallow decided to concede immunity, because she already had one idol. Before Tribal Council, Hantz gave her his idol, as well. She then went and talked to Kimmel, who warned that Shallow should play the idol for herself. But at Tribal Council, Shallow, not trusting Kimmel's warning,played both idols on Sandra Diaz-Twine and Manthey, sending Thomas home in a 5–0 vote.

Shallow returned to play Survivor for a third time as a part of the Villains tribe. She quickly accepted an alliance with Russell Hantz and Danielle DiLorenzo. On day 18, the Villains lost immunity, and the alliance of Shallow, Hantz, and DiLorenzo were still struggling to gain control of the game. They finally gained control when they persuaded Jerri Manthey to switch sides and vote out Hantz's rival, Rob Mariano. Because the Villains had yet to vote out a female member at that point in the game, the Heroes assumed that the Villains tribe was being run by an all-women alliance, led by Shallow. When the Villains lost immunity again on day 21, they decided to further confirm the Heroes' belief of that, by voting out Benjamin "Coach" Wade. Shallow and DiLorenzo both found the hidden immunity idol together and decided not to tell Hantz. On day 24, the Villains lost immunity again and James "J. T." Thomas Jr. gave his idol to Hantz, in hopes that he would use it to vote out Shallow. Hantz, however, showed it to Shallow, along with DiLorenzo and Manthey.
Shallow made it all the way to the Final Three with Fields and Kimmel (as promised). However, she was heartbroken to learn that only two of them would face the jury. She was eliminated first at the Final Immunity Challenge but was chosen to be in the Final Two by Kimmel as Kimmel felt that Fields would be extremely tough to beat at the Final Tribal Council. At the Final Tribal Council, Shallow convinced the jury to vote for her because of her aggressive game play compared to her previous season. Despite being accused of being a mean person by Orlins and a backstabber by Lusth, the jury decided to award Shallow the title of Sole Survivor with a close vote of 5–3, getting votes from Orlins, Siska, Jones, Bolton, and Fields.

At the merge, Shallow found herself in a good position as she was allied with six (Jones, Kimmel, Fields, Bolton, Lusth, Clement) of the nine people left. During the tenth Immunity Challenge, Shallow convinced Jason Siska to step down from the challenge so that she could win Immunity, which worked (under the condition that the tribe would not vote off Siska). However, her "Couples Alliance" decided to go back on their word and they targeted Siska. However, Fields saw this as an opportunity to blindside physical threat Lusth instead, and she needed Shallow's help for it to work. Shallow agreed to this and recruited her Airai female allies Bolton and Jones to the plan, and Lusth was voted off 5–4. Afterward, Shallow found herself in a failed attempt to patch things up with Clement and Kimmel (who kept her distrust to herself). The five remaining women then formed an alliance to vote off the men, starting with Siska. However, when Clement was evacuated and Erik Reichenbach won Immunity, they were forced to vote off one of their own. Kimmel was the intended target, a plan of which Shallow did not want any part. So she helped Kimmel find the Hidden Immunity Idol (which was buried under the tribal flag) and together, they voted off possible jury threat Jones.
Shallow currently resides in Los Angeles, California and is a yoga teacher.[27][28]

Shallow once again returned to compete on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War. She was a member of the Sele tribe and aligned with fellow old schoolers Boston Rob Mariano, Ethan Zohn, and Danni Boatwright. However, when Sele lost immunity on day 6, Boatwright felt betrayed by Shallow and told Mariano to target Shallow instead of one of the new school players. Mariano told Shallow this plan, and Boatwright was voted out unanimously. Shallow was able to survive a few more votes until the tribe swap. After the swap, she remained on Sele along with former Sele member Michele Fitzgerald and three former Dakal members—Yul Kwon, Nick Wilson, and Wendell Holland. After losing the second immunity challenge as new tribes, Shallow found herself in the minority along with Fitzgerald. She was unsuccessful in convincing Wilson to flip and was voted out in episode 6 in a 3-2 vote, becoming the seventh person sent to the Edge of Extinction. She bequeathed her fire tokens to Fitzgerald. Shallow's journey for this season came to an end on day 35 after failing to win the chance to re-enter the game in the second and final Edge of Extinction challenge. As a juror, she cast her vote for eventual runner-up Natalie Anderson.[6][7]

With 149 days played over four seasons, Shallow had played the second-longest Survivor career, only behind Mariano's 152, both of which surpassed the previous record set by Ozzy Lusth after his participation in Survivor: Game Changers in 2017, at 128.[8]
Shallow began competing in boxing in 2004. She and some fellow boxers created a non-profit organization titled "Knockouts for Girls", a charity that provides scholarships and boxing lessons for underprivileged girls.[4]
At the merge, despite coming with a 5–4 member advantage over Aitu, Shallow found herself in the minority as Penner betrayed his former tribe mates and joined the Aitu Four in voting out Nate Gonzalez. She became angry with Penner, and a day after his betrayal, when she cut her thumb with a machete while cutting a coconut, she said that she was imagining the coconut was Penner's head. After alliance member Woodcock was eliminated, Shallow and Gentry found themselves fighting for survival. Despite being on the outside, Shallow was able to retain her strength and win two reward challenges, one being the "loved one" challenge. This worried the Aitu Four, who were dissatisfied with how Gentry and Shallow lay around camp sleeping, while they worked and got their food. In an attempt to stay in the game, Gentry and Shallow talked to Yul Kwon about voting out Penner first in exchange for their jury votes, a plan which succeeded. On day 36, Shallow was finally voted out in a 4–2 vote when the Aitu Four saw her craftiness as more of a threat than Gentry's physical strength. As a juror, she cast her vote for eventual runner-up Ozzy Lusth.

On day 33, Hantz won immunity, and decided to turn on his alliance. He tried to pit Shallow and DiLorenzo against each other, but failed. He then aligned with the Heroes to vote DiLorenzo out, and with some help from Manthey, DiLorenzo was voted out in a 4–3 vote. He then aligned with the Heroes again and decided to target Shallow. However, his plan was ruined when she won immunity on day 36. Shallow then won her third challenge on day 37, and they voted the last Hero, Colby Donaldson, out of the game in a 4–1 vote. After Shallow failed to win the final immunity challenge, it seemed that she would be voted out, since everyone wanted her gone. She, on the other hand, wanted to get rid of Diaz-Twine, thinking she would get a lot of votes in the end. However, the four remaining players voted out Manthey in a 3–1 vote; Hantz had believed he would get her vote to win Sole Survivor.

Shallow originally appeared as part of the Rarotonga (Raro) tribe, which represented Caucasians, along with Adam Gentry, Jonathan Penner, Jessica "Flicka" Smith, and Candice Woodcock. Her tribe did not face any danger for the first six days as they had won immunity. At the end of the second immunity challenge, Billy Garcia of the Aitutaki (Aitu) tribe told Shallow and Woodcock that he was next to go. Woodcock replied, "We love you," and Garcia believed that Woodcock had fallen in love with him. Shallow was particularly allied with Gentry and Woodcock, who truly were romantically involved. When the four tribes were merged into two, Shallow and Gentry remained in Raro while their other tribe mates were sent to Aitu. Despite being stronger in number, the new Raro continually lost in challenges. Shallow pressed for the elimination of J.P. Calderon, whom she thought as arrogant, and he became the fourth person voted out despite his physical strength. Shallow survived her tribe's next three Tribal Councils as Calderon, Stephannie Favor, and Cristina Coria were each voted off. When the contestants were down to 12, a "Mutiny" twist was presented where anybody could change tribe affiliations, and for the first time it was accepted. Shallow's former tribe mates Penner and Woodcock decided to jump back to Raro. Raro lost the next two Immunity challenges, but Shallow remained loyal to her original Raro tribemates by eliminating Brad Virata, Rebecca Borman, and Jenny Guzon-Bae.

Colby and Tina each pleaded their case for a million dollars. Tina asked the jury not to vote for someone because they got their feelings hurt and that what she was going home to was worth more than a million dollars. Colby said that while he did not beat Tina in strategy, he did everything pretty well. Each member of the jury asked the two contestants a question. For their closing arguments, Colby had no comments. Tina talked about backgammon and how it related to her personal strategy, and that no one's vote off was personal.
Tina Wesson was named the Sole Survivor, defeating Colby Donaldson by a jury vote of 4–3 and winning a prize of US$1,000,000. Wesson became the first female winner of the series. The series was generally well received, with many outlets considering it one of the best Survivor series. The opening episode premiered after Super Bowl XXXV to 43.5 million viewers.
At tree mail on day 40, the final three were given wood, paint, and feathers to create idols, which would be given back to the land. On the way to their immunity challenge, they walked past the torches of those who left before them. At the end of the walk, they found a quiet spot to reflect on their time in the Outback, then threw their idols into the river. Keith said he realized that it was not about the money and that you should walk away with something much more valuable; Tina said she had learned how much her family means to her; Colby said making the idol made him appreciate and remember why he was there.
After two tied votes between Colby and Jeff, a Tribal Council countback was called as a tiebreaker. Colby had no previous votes but Jeff had two, therefore Jeff was eliminated.

Tina and Keith were concerned about their position in the tribe following the previous night's Tribal Council, where Jerri said she was friends with everyone except them. Kimmi led Kucha to win the reward challenge and receive three chickens and a rooster. Michael wanted to eat the chickens as soon as possible, but Nick told him that they needed to make decisions as a group. With Nick's help, Michael caught and killed a pig. Ogakor took a 3–2 lead in a trivia immunity challenge, but Kucha pulled even and then won thanks to Alicia answering the final question correctly.
With the end near, the contestants talked about how much they missed their families. At the last reward challenge, an obstacle course composed of stages from challenges, the final four had a chance to redeem themselves from past challenges. Colby was the first through the rope course and the puzzle, followed by Elisabeth, Keith, and Tina. Colby and Elisabeth were dead even at the fire station, but Colby's bucket rose first, continuing his winning streak. The prize was a Pontiac Aztek, a good night's sleep, a hot shower and meal.

The challenge boosted everyone's spirits; Colby said that for that one day, no one cared about winning a million dollars. The next morning, after a long night of rain, Keith and Rodger found a smoldering log from a forest fire, which helped them rekindle their fire. After rationing the rice for the number of days they had left, Keith continued to make more rice. Boredom began to set in, as there was nothing to do around camp.

Survivor is a reality television show created by Mark Burnett and Charlie Parsons and based on the Swedish show Expedition Robinson.[1] The series follows a number of participants who are isolated in a remote location, where they must provide food, fire, and shelter for themselves.[1] Every three days, one participant is removed from the series by majority vote, with challenges being held to give a reward (ranging from living and food-related prizes to a car) and immunity from being voted off the show.[2] The last remaining player is awarded a prize of $1,000,000.[2]

During a reward trip, contestant Colby Donaldson broke an Australian law by breaking off coral from the Great Barrier Reef which could have resulted in a fine of A$110,000. The helicopter pilot involved in the reward trip also broke an Australian law as he flew over sea bird rookeries.[32] Producer Mark Burnett apologized on behalf of Donaldson and the production team after the season had aired.[33]

Colby and Jeff were not eligible to vote in the second Tribal Council vote.
The cast consisted of 16 contestants, who were initially separated into two tribes: Ogakor, named after the word for "crocodile" in the Kunjen language, and Kucha, named after the word for "kangaroo" in the Pakanha language. Midway through the season, the remaining ten players merged into a single "Barramundi" tribe, named after the river fish. The final seven eliminated contestants comprised the jury that decided who would be the winner.[2]

Back at camp, they received a mirror and a scale in tree mail to see how much weight they had lost and how they looked. Tina had lost 16 pounds, Elisabeth 12, Keith 27, and Colby 25. The women gave a "car-warming" gift of wildflowers to Colby. Jeff Probst took Colby to his new car and joined him at dinner. They feasted on appetizers for a few minutes, until Probst had the food brought out – by Colby's mother. He was in disbelief and excited to see her and gave her a long hug. His mom said she was not prepared to see how much weight he had lost. Colby brought his mom back to camp, and she brought care packages and news from everyone's families. Eventually, the helicopter came to take Colby's mom away.

Although Ogakor fared significantly worse in challenges, the tribes were merged with five members apiece after Kucha member Michael Skupin suffered third-degree burns from a campfire and had to be medically evacuated.[16] The first vote after the merge saw a tie, but Kucha member Jeff Varner was eliminated due to previous votes being cast against him. Ogakor's majority alliance of Colby Donaldson, Keith Famie, and Tina Wesson alternated between eliminating former Kucha members and betraying former tribe-mates Jerri Manthey and Amber Brkich. The three stayed together until the end, and Donaldson took Wesson with him into the final Tribal Council. Tina's strategic plan was valued over Colby's prowess in challenges, and she was awarded the title of Sole Survivor by a jury vote of 4–3.

The final immunity challenge took place at Tribal Council. The contestants had to answer questions about the players who made up the Barramundi tribe. Colby took the lead after 7 questions, but Tina pulled even. After 11 questions, they were tied, but Colby answered the final question correctly, continuing his dominance and allowing him to choose whom to take with him to the final two. Colby chose philanthropy over strategy and picked Tina, making Keith the final member of the jury.
The merge was on Kucha's mind; they wanted to go in 6–4 and knew the next immunity challenge would be key. In the reward challenge, the tribes were blindfolded except for one member each, who had to navigate the tribe through a series of tasks. The winning tribe would receive a picnic basket of chips and soda. Ogakor became excited at the thought of a picnic and did yoga to prepare themselves; Kucha was more focused on not having Ogakor win. Ogakor led at the beginning, but Amber veered off track and Alicia and Jeff from Kucha narrowly beat her to the end. Frustrated, Colby filled up a bucket of water and threw it at Jerri.

Since Kimmi told Ogakor that Debb voted for Jeff Varner at the first Tribal Council, Jeff Varner was worried that his previous number of votes would cause him to lose after a 5–5 tie. At Ogakor, they waited for information regarding the accident. Ogakor's tree mail told the men to go to the other tribe to scout the other tribe's camp; Kucha's tree mail told the women to go. When Elisabeth and Alicia showed up at Ogakor, they filled the women in on Michael's accident. The women were shocked, but relieved to hear that it was not life-threatening. The Kucha men were surprised to see Keith and Colby and sensed that Keith was the outsider of the tribe.

Michael became fixated on providing for his tribe and was determined to ambush and catch a pig. In the reward challenge, one member had to hold a shoulder pole while a "loader" placed buckets on the pole. The remaining tribe members would then traverse a long balance beam with a pole on their shoulder and one bucket on either side and hang it on the opposing tribe's pole. When neither Ogakor's Colby nor Kucha's Michael cracked, a run-off race was arranged. Ogakor won and received some fishing gear.

The owners decided to field teams of replacement players to fulfill their obligation to the ticket holders and television networks.Hogeboom led the Colts replacement players to a 2–0 record before being injured in the second game. This injury was caused by veteran defensive end Marty Lyons flagrantly spearing him on a quarterback sneak play, breaking a rib in his back and puncturing a lung.[16] Although the Colts lost the last strike game with a new quarterback, the victories in the previous contests were crucial in securing the franchise's first playoff berth in ten years.
Hogeboom was assumed to be lost for the season and rookie Jack Trudeau was forced into the starting lineup and the team struggled through the season with thirteen straight losses. After the last loss, Dowhower was fired and former Southern Methodist University and New England Patriots coach Ron Meyer was brought in.[14]
Hogeboom surprised everyone by returning and starting for Meyer's first game as the Colts coach. They were matched against the Atlanta Falcons and were a heavy underdog, Hogeboom played a great game helping the Colts come from behind to win on a blocked punt at the end of the fourth quarter. The Colts shocked the league by winning the last three games of the season to finish up at 3–13 and generating optimism heading into the next season.[15]

Prior to the 1983 season, the Cowboy players and fans began to lobby for Hogeboom to be the starting quarterback. White had led the team to three straight NFC Championship game appearances after taking over for Hall of Famer Roger Staubach, but couldn't win a Super Bowl. The players also felt that White had betrayed them because of his public support for the NFL team owners during the 1982 NFL players strike. Furthermore, White was seen as quiet and standoffish, unlike the more vocal and personable Hogeboom.[citation needed]
After acquiring Hogeboom the Indianapolis Colts traded Mike Pagel, who had been the previous starter at quarterback, to the Cleveland Browns for a ninth round pick(#247-Bob Ontko) in the 1987 NFL Draft.[12]

After the strike, Jack Trudeau started the next four games with a 2–2 record. After a win against the New England Patriots, the Colts made a blockbuster trade to get star running back Eric Dickerson. Since Hogeboom's injury had healed, he was re-inserted as the starter, helping the team win against the Miami Dolphins, but also lost against the New England Patriots. In the next game, he led the Colts to a rousing home win versus the Houston Oilers. However, Hogeboom was to again be injured in this game. On a 22-yard touchdown pass to Albert Bentley, Hogeboom was struck on the inside part of his throwing arm by a blitzing Jeff Donaldson. This blow drove his arm up in an unnatural way, dislocating his right shoulder and sending him to the injured reserve list.[17]
Hogeboom started out well, completing 33 passes (club record) for 343 yards and one touchdown in a season opening win on Monday night on national TV against the Los Angeles Rams. However, in the next game against the New York Giants, linebacker Lawrence Taylor sacked him four times and the Cowboys lost, 28–7. Despite the Cowboys 5–3 record, White relieved Hogeboom three games in a row, so Landry went back to the more experienced White against the Indianapolis Colts and New York Giants.[8][9]

In 2005, Hogeboom was a contestant on Survivor: Guatemala, the 11th season of the CBS reality TV show Survivor.He kept his professional sports past a secret and even sneakily claimed that he was a landscaper named Gary Hawkins.He did this out of fear that he would be eliminated right away if the other competitors assumed he was already wealthy, being a former NFL quarterback.Unfortunately for him, his plan failed when another contestant, Danni Boatwright, who worked in sports radio, recognized him immediately.Despite this confrontation between the two, Danni would be Gary's closest ally throughout the game. In fact, post-show interviews from other contestants revealed that they actually all knew his real identity but didn't care, because he was a strong, well-liked player.
On August 28, he was named the starter during a press conference where head coach Tom Landry began by announcing that offensive tackle Phil Pozderac would be the starter, only to catch the error and mispronounce the last name by saying "Hogenbloom".[7]
In 1989, he was inducted into the Central Michigan Athletics Hall Of Fame. In 1994, he was inducted into the Mid-American Conference Sports Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was inducted into the Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame.

The Colts got off to a shaky start losing in New England 33–3. The next week against the Miami Dolphins, the Colts lost both the game and Hogeboom, when he was injured after picking up an Albert Bentley fumble and being tackled by Dolphin's safety Lyle Blackwood at the end of a 50-yard run. On the play Hogeboom had the opportunity to run safely out of bounds, but instead tried to gain additional yards. Blackwood physically picked Hogeboom up and drove him into the ground, causing a serious right (throwing) shoulder separation.[13] Colts General Manager Jim Irsay had this to say of the tackle:"The way it looked on TV, it was a malicious tackle," "If that's the case, I think a player should be suspended. You're talking about knocking out a team's starting quarterback."
The excitement was high at Hogeboom's arrival, as the franchise had not seen quality quarterback play since the days of Bert Jones. It was thought that giving head coach Rod Dowhower something to work with would yield great results, as he made his name with the St. Louis Cardinals where he helped develop Neil Lomax.
He was acquired because of Neil Lomax's problematic arthritic left hip, which eventually forced him to retire. Hogeboom was named the starter and posted career highs with 2,591 passing yards, 14 touchdowns and 19 interceptions, but finished with a 5–8 record.[21] The next year Joe Bugel was hired as the new head coach and Hogeboom was waived on September 3, 1990.[22]

As a junior in 1978, he became the starter at quarterback in a triple-option wishbone offense, registering 1,095 passing yards, 5 passing touchdowns, 329 rushing yards and 5 rushing touchdowns, while contributing to a 9–2 record.[1] The next year, he posted 1,404 passing yards, 9 passing touchdowns, 417 rushing yards and 9 rushing touchdowns, leading his team to the school's first Mid-American Conference title with a 10–0–1 record.
Hogeboom was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round (133rd overall) of the 1980 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he earned a roster spot following the retirement of Roger Staubach. He was the third-string quarterback in his first 2 seasons.
With a potential player strike looming, the Colts started the 1987 season with two losses, one was with Jack Trudeau who was replacing an injured Hogeboom. At this point the NFL Players Association chose to call a work stoppage and Hogeboom was one of the handful of players who chose to cross the picket lines and keep playing. At issue was specific language in Hogeboom's contract which potentially could have cost him all his remaining salary.
After a poor performance by both quarterbacks against the Giants, Hogeboom regained the starting position. The constant change at quarterback didn't help to improve the team's inconsistent play, eventually resulting in a 14–3 loss to the previously winless Buffalo Bills. White would go on to start the last 4 games, putting an end to one of the most famous quarterback controversies in NFL history.[10] Hogeboom produced a 6–4 record in 10 starts, posting 2,366 passing yards, 7 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.
In the 1984 pre-season, Hogeboom completed 18 out of 32 attempts for 255 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions, compared to White's 46 out of 83 attempts for 609 yards, 3 touchdowns and 4 interceptions.[6]

Jack Trudeau would finish out the season as the starter, taking the Colts to their first playoff game since 1977, which they would lose21–38 against the Cleveland Browns.[18]
Against the San Diego Chargers, coach Meyer unveiled the wishbone offense, in which Hogeboom would be used on occasions during the season.[19] He also came off the bench for an injured Chandler, to lead the team to a 17–14 win against the Buffalo Bills. At the end of the year, he was left unprotected—eligible to sign with any team that wanted him—under Plan B free agency.

In 1982, he passed Glenn Carano on the depth chart for the backup quarterback role behind Danny White.[2] In the 1982 NFC title game against the Washington Redskins, he replaced a concussed White at the start of the second half and helped the team get back in the contest with 2 consecutive scoring drives, until making two critical interceptions, one returned by Darryl Grant for a touchdown that sealed the 31–17 loss. He completed 14 out of 29 attempts for 162 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.[3] He began to garner attention and opened some eyes from Cowboys coaches and players alike with this performance.[4]

Hogeboom played for eleven seasons (1980–1990) and passed for 9,346 yards, 49 touchdowns and 60 interceptions, along with 164 rushing yards and 4 rushing touchdowns.
White responded to the criticism by having his best statistical season ever in 1983 and leading the Cowboys to a 12–2 record going into a home matchup against the Redskins. However, the Cowboys were beaten at home by a score of 31–10, and the Redskins would go on to finish the season at 14–2, and reach their second straight Super Bowl. The Cowboys, meanwhile, would lose soundly 42–17 the next week to the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football, and then lose 24–17 in the wildcard playoff game at home against the Los Angeles Rams. The rumblings for White to be benched got stronger and Hogeboom also began demanding to be traded.[5]
The team gave Hogeboom more playing time in the pre-season, where he completed 42 out of 74 attempts for 475 yards, 4 touchdowns, 3 interceptions and a 77.1 quarterback rating.[citation needed]
Hogeboom was eliminated on Day 30 and became the third jury member, after saving himself from elimination by using the hidden immunity idol at a previous Tribal Council; his elimination was unrelated to the issue of his true identity, simply coming down to the powerful alliance of Rafe Judkins, Stephenie LaGrossa, Cindy Hall, Lydia Morales, and Judd Sergeant voting off non-alliance members. After Hogeboom was voted out, he confessed in his final words that his name was Gary Hogeboom and he was an ex-NFL quarterback. He went down in Survivor history as the first person to ever find and play a hidden immunity idol at Tribal Council.

On August 2, 2006, Hasselbeck got into a heated debate in which she strongly opposed the Food and Drug Administration's plan to sell the "morning-after pill" as an over-the-counter drug. Hasselbeck stated, "I believe that life begins at the moment of conception." She said the over-the-counter distribution of the pill should be banned even in cases of rape and incest, because "life still has value." Hasselbeck argued that advocates of the drug use the "rape or incest" exception as a "bait-and-switch" distraction from the goal of making it universally accessible. She argued that if the "rape or incest" exception were all advocates cared about, they would not support its over-the-counter status.[9] On air, moderator Barbara Walters advised Hasselbeck to calm down after she became emotional about the topic. When the live show went to a commercial break, Hasselbeck ripped up her cue cards and stormed off the set. In an expletive-laden off-air conversation picked up on a live mic, Hasselbeck explained to co-host Joy Behar that she did not appreciate being reprimanded on live TV by Walters for being passionate about the topic. She threatened to quit, but producer Bill Geddie convinced her to come back to the set. As the show came back from the break, Walters and Elisabeth appeared together on a couch, awkwardly making up for the situation. Hasselbeck hugged Walters, sat on her lap, and ended up backing off from her threat to quit.

In 2001, Hasselbeck (then Elisabeth Filarski) was cast in Survivor: The Australian Outback, and was originally a member of the Kucha tribe. She avoided being voted out at the first Tribal Council which her tribe attended. She then went on a winning streak but lost once again in episode five, where they voted out Kimmi. In episode six, Hasselbeck's tribemate Michael Skupin fell into the campfire and had to be medically evacuated, therefore sending the Kucha and Ogakor tribes into the merge with five members each. When the merge came, she lasted almost nine hours in the first individual immunity challenge in which contestants had to stand on a perch in the water for as long as possible. When the first vote came, her tribemate Jeff was voted out due to previous votes cast against him. This led to another Kucha member Alicia being voted out and sent to the jury. Filarski was next on the block when the biggest threat in her original tribe, Nick, won immunity, but she swayed the votes of Ogakor members Tina Wesson and Colby Donaldson her way, and had Jerri Manthey voted out. At the final five, her closest ally throughout the entire game, Rodger Bingham, was voted out. She then became the sole remaining Kucha member and was voted out, coming in fourth overall. She was one of four votes for Tina to win. She was one of two people who were asked to return for Survivor: All-Stars and declined, the other being Colleen Haskell of Survivor: Borneo.

On May 23, 2007, Hasselbeck was involved in a heated on-air argument with co-host Rosie O'Donnell concerning the war in Iraq, which she supported and O'Donnell opposed. When O'Donnell asked, "655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists?"[10] O'Donnell was criticized by conservative commentators (including Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly) for her question and she (O'Donnell) complained about Hasselbeck's unwillingness to defend O'Donnell's statements in the controversy that followed. Hasselbeck responded "defend your own insinuations," adding that she should not have to defend anyone else's words for them, especially when that person has a forum in which to present a defense.[11]

Wendell Holland returned to compete on Survivor: Winners at War.
The 20 castaways were divided into two tribes: Malolo and Naviti. Naviti fared better in challenges but was divided by a conflict between Domenick and Chris. Through two tribe shuffles, Naviti held the majority on every tribe; some, such as Kellyn, held strong to eliminate original Malolos, while others, like Domenick and his closest ally Wendell, worked to consolidate power at the merge, forming an alliance with original Malolos Donathan and Laurel.

Chris received a hidden immunity idol on Ghost Island which could only be used at the following Tribal Council; however, a game of chance allowed him to extend the idol's power for one more Tribal Council; however, he lost the game of chance afterwards and therefore lost his vote at the next Tribal Council.
The final four were Domenick, Laurel, Wendell and outsider Angela. Domenick won the final immunity challenge and turned on Wendell as the biggest remaining threat. He decided to bring Laurel to the end of the game, leaving Angela to face Wendell in the fire-making challenge to determine the third finalist, which Wendell won. At the final Tribal Council, the jury debated between Domenick’s more aggressive strategic game and Wendell’s more relaxed social game, and the ten jurors tied the vote, with five votes each on Domenick and Wendell. Laurel, as the third-place finalist with zero votes, cast the tie-breaking vote for Wendell, crowning him the Sole Survivor.
Wendell won immunity again. Donathan told Domenick he'd take him to the end after getting asked, while Wendell considered giving his idol to Angela, Donathan, or Laurel, but he and Domenick realized Laurel was their biggest threat in immunity challenges. At Tribal Council, Domenick played his idol on himself, while Wendell played his idol for Laurel, negating one vote against her. Ultimately, Donathan was unanimously sent to the jury.
Donathan played a hidden immunity idol on himself, therefore one vote against him was not counted.
^ a b The vote resulted in a tie. Per the rules, a second vote was held where the castaways involved in the tie would not vote and the remaining castaways could only vote for those who tied.

Naviti won the challenge, and also received a flint reward, as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge. For winning the immunity challenge, Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island, where they would be immune from the vote; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history. On Ghost Island, Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage; if he lost, he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council. He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra’s legacy advantage from Game Changers. He had to will it to someone from Naviti, and he chose Morgan. He also made a fake idol. At Malolo, the tribe had to come up with a new plan, as Jacob was their intended target. Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe’s weakest link, but at Tribal Council, her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates, asking who they were targeting that night. Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan, it was revealed that they had lied to her, and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided, becoming the first person voted out.

Immunity Challenge: Castaways will have to swim out to a bamboo cage, hop over and dive in the cage to release a door underwater. They will then need to take a chest in the cage ashore, and race it across a track. On the track, tribes will need to use a grappling hook to connect a missing piece of the track allowing them to get the chest to a perch. Using the balls in the chest, they will need to get all five of them on top of a narrow perch to win immunity.
Immunity Challenge: Each castaway must balance a small metal ball on a wooden cylinder, while holding the center cylinder in place with two wooden handles. After a certain amount of time, new pieces of the wooden rod will be added, making it harder to balance the ball on the center cylinder. The castaway who balances their ball the longest wins immunity.

For Malolo and Naviti, respectively, Michael and Sebastian were selected to run the course, while Laurel and Desiree were selected for the puzzle. Chris pulled the lever on Desiree, preserving Naviti’s fishing kit, but giving the larger reward to Malolo. As the Malolo tribe set up their shelter and got to know each other, Jacob openly stated his intention to search for a hidden immunity idol, causing his tribemates to distrust him. He also poured some of the tribe’s rice in his dirty sock to see if a clue was hidden in the jar, though there was not. Meanwhile, at the Naviti camp, a power struggle started between Chris and Domenick, who questioned Chris’s decision to forfeit the opening challenge.

Chris led Naviti to an easy victory. The tribe instantly decided to go to rocks to determine who from Malolo would go to Ghost Island. Stephanie was sent to Ghost Island; her urn was empty. At Naviti, Chris and Donathan bonded over having to take care of their families.
The morning after Libby's elimination, Desiree plotted with the old Malolo members to bring in Chelsea and Angela to overthrow the Naviti majority because she felt like she was on the bottom, but Laurel was skeptical.

Reward/Immunity Challenge: Castaways will need to jump between three sets of raised ramps to a sand pit, where they will need to dig out a heavy ladder. Using the ladder, one tribe member will need to retrieve a monkey’s fist on top of a tripod, which they will use to climb the first ramp of the tower. The tribe will then need to hoist each other to the top of a second ramp, where two members will need to solve a tiki head puzzle to win immunity and a tarp.

With few exceptions, castaways were exiled to Ghost Island after being chosen by the winners of the reward challenge. The challenge winners were required to unanimously choose a losing castaway; if they were unable to do so, the losing castaways would draw colored rocks to determine who would be exiled. On Ghost Island, exiled castaways were instructed to smash the next in a series of urns, some of which would allow the castaway to compete in a game of chance for an advantage in the game. The advantages were taken from previous seasons of Survivor, all of which were misplayed in their original seasons. Exiled castaways were given the opportunity to acquire these advantages under the premise of learning from past castaways' mistakes.
Wendell forgot one of Yanuya's bags, but he made up for the deficit, leading his tribe from last to first place, and Naviti placed second. Desiree was upset with herself over her poor leadership in the challenge, but Kellyn suggested to her and Angela that they vote out James, who later tried to bring Angela to his side. After a talk with Angela, Kellyn was skeptical of Angela's loyalty, but at Tribal Council, Angela stayed loyal and Michael joined the former Naviti members in blindsiding James out of the game.
Sebastian won reward and chose to share it with Domenick, Wendell, Donathan and their loved ones. Sebastian also had to send one of the other four to Ghost Island where an advantage will be available off the bat, unless he or one of the other reward participants volunteers to give up their reward. Wendell volunteered, and he received Malcolm's final immunity challenge advantage from Philippines. On reward, Domenick tried to align with Donathan and Sebastian, but Donathan was wary. At camp, Kellyn was bitter about not getting chosen for reward or for the advantage on Ghost Island; she and Angela plotted a girls' alliance out of revenge. Laurel weighed the pros and cons of turning on Domenick and Wendell.
Immunity Challenge: Castaways would have to eat exotic dishes and show their empty tongues to finish, in which a certain number of fastest finishers would advance to the next round. The castaway that finishes all stages wins immunity.
After Tribal Council, Domenick expressed his gratitude toward Laurel for saving him, Wendell, and Kellyn, but Kellyn still wanted to pick off the old Malolo members. Meanwhile, Chelsea felt she was in danger since she had been blindsided by the previous vote. Domenick also considered turning against Wendell before looking for an idol. He found the fake idol Jay played in Millennials vs. Gen X, which still had no power, but Domenick had the opportunity to use it to trick the other players with it. Before the challenge, Jeff announced a random draw of two "tribes" for that day only, each of which would go to Tribal Council, meaning two people would be eliminated that night and Ghost Island was not in play.

Everyone dropped their stack at least once, but Domenick managed to win his third immunity challenge, as well as the right to choose who to take to the end with him. The final 4 ventured to Ghost Island, where Laurel tried to convince Domenick that she wouldn't beat Wendell in the fire-making challenge. Angela tried to convince Domenick that Laurel was a bigger threat in the Final Tribal Council. A note told Domenick to choose one of three voting urns to be used at the Final Tribal Council, all of which were cursed due to a contestant taking the wrong person to the end; the urns were from The Australian Outback, Game Changers, and Cagayan. He chose the Cagayan urn. He also privately considered giving his immunity necklace to Angela and taking on Wendell himself in the fire-making challenge. However, he chose to keep immunity and brought Laurel to the end; Wendell won the fire-making challenge, making Angela the 10th member of the jury.

On Day 29, a double Tribal Council was held where the tribe was divided into two groups of five each; each group went to Tribal Council separately to eliminate one castaway from each.
Domenick and Wendell won reward; they chose Laurel to join them and sent Sebastian to Ghost Island. There was a 3 in 4 chance of getting an advantage, and Sebastian won Kellyn's misplayed extra vote that came back into play. While on reward, Laurel was secretly ready to turn on Domenick and Wendell. Back at camp, Donathan told Wendell he would cast his jury vote for Domenick over him, in hopes that they would turn on each other, but they saw through the plan.
Since Donathan was not picked, he had no shot at reward but was ineligible for Ghost Island. The team of Chelsea, Jenna, Kellyn, Michael, and Sebastian won the challenge; Angela got sent to Ghost Island via rock draw. While on reward, Michael told Chelsea, Kellyn, and Sebastian he was willing to work with them as an extra number, but Kellyn wanted to stay strong with Naviti and pick off the Malolo members. On Ghost Island, Angela played the game of chance but lost her vote after choosing the wrong chest. At camp, Laurel told Domenick about Desiree potentially turning on them, and Domenick told Kellyn, who was shocked. Michael started searching for an idol, and Donathan joined him, eventually finding Scot's idol from Kaôh Rōng. It was powerless unless Tai's matching idol from the same season, which was hidden under the shelter, completed the idol. After a while, Donathan found the second half of the idol but was forced to tell the other old Malolo members about it as several tribemates shuffled in and out of camp.

Yanuya placed first and Malolo finally ended their losing streak, sending Naviti to Tribal Council. Bradley targeted Libby, but Chelsea talked to Libby about voting out Bradley. She and Domenick were later torn between voting out Libby or Bradley, but ultimately, they decided to unanimously vote Bradley out.
This season introduced Ghost Island, a secluded location similar to Exile Island, where castaways were banished for short periods.[3] The island was decorated with mementos and props from previous seasons of Survivor, including torch snuffers and immunity idols.

Immunity Challenge: Castaways must pull up on a bar to keep a ball wedged between a set of jaws. If they release the bar, the lower jaw will fall, causing their ball to fall out. Once their ball falls, they are out. The last person remaining from each team wins immunity. Additionally, the last person left standing overall allows their team to view the results of first team's Tribal Council and vote second.
Malolo lost yet another challenge. For placing first, Naviti had the power to send someone from either Yanuya or Malolo to Ghost Island; they unanimously decided to send Kellyn, since she had been there before. On Ghost Island, Kellyn was again given a game of chance to play. She was to pick from three urns instead of two; two held advantages, while one would cost her vote at the next Tribal Council. She won the vote stealer from Game Changers that Michaela failed to find, now downgraded to only an extra vote. At Naviti, Bradley's condescending attitude towards Donathan and Domenick rubbed them the wrong way. At Yanuya, Wendell took advantage of an opportunity to look for an idol while his tribemates were asleep. He spotted a unique tree and discovered a map to a hidden immunity idol at its base, which he then found. The idol was revealed to be the immunity necklace that Erik gave to Natalie in Micronesia and getting voted out. At Malolo, the tribe burned their flag's banner under Desiree's lead to reverse the curse of their losing streak.

Immunity Challenge: Starting on the beach, one runner from each tribe will grab a boogie board attached to a large spool of rope and race across a series of floating balance beams to a set of four satchels with numbered tiles. Grabbing only one satchel, the runner will get on the boogie board in the water, where their tribemates will have to reel them onto shore. Once the runner returns to shore, another person goes out. Once they have all four satchels, tribes will make their way to the finish deck, where they will used the numbered tiles to solve a combination lock, obtaining a key, which unlocks the tribe's sliding puzzle. The first tribe to finish their puzzle wins immunity.

If they fall off the perch or their tiki statue drops, they are out of the challenge. The last person standing wins.
Angela defeated Michael in the final round to win immunity. Angela's allies tried to sway Donathan to their side with an idea to split the vote between Michael and Libby. Michael pitched to the other former Malolo members to vote out Wendell, while Domenick assured Libby she was safe. Wanting to make a move and even the playing field, Donathan told Libby of Naviti's plan to split the vote between her and Michael, making Libby unsure of whom to trust. At Tribal Council, the Malolo plan fell through as they joined the original Navitis in splitting the vote against Libby and Michael. Michael played his idol, negating seven votes, sending Libby to the jury with four votes.

Malolo won the challenge; after they couldn't decide who from Naviti to send to Ghost Island, the Naviti members drew rocks to determine who would go. Chris drew the odd-colored rock, foiling Domenick's plan to blindside him. On Ghost Island, the urn Chris smashed was empty, and he opened up about his mother's struggle with multiple sclerosis. At Naviti, Angela wanted to stay strong with her old tribe members and vote out Libby, but Wendell saw Angela as Chris's "right-hand man", and started to rally votes against her. Meanwhile, Domenick showed his fake idol to the former Malolo members to build trust with them, but James didn't believe him and, seeing an opportunity to control the vote as Naviti was set to turn on Angela, pitched an idea to the other former Malolo members to vote out Morgan, which Libby objected to. However, at Tribal Council, Libby reluctantly sided with the majority, sending a shocked Morgan out of the game. Before her exit, Morgan willed the legacy advantage to Domenick.
Kellyn outlasted Libby to win immunity. Back at camp, Chris gathered everyone except Domenick and Wendell in an attempt to dictate a split vote betweenthose two in case Domenick played his idol. While they were alone, Wendell told Domenick about his idol. Donathan immediately told them about Chris's plan to split the votes, while Desiree gathered the Naviti women to discuss a blindside of Libby, since everyone might be voting for either Chris, Domenick, or Wendell. At Tribal Council, Domenick openly wore his fake idol, then played the Legacy Advantage on himself, while Chris decided not to play his idol. Desiree and Angela voted against Libby, but everyone else voted against Chris, making him the first member of the jury.
While attempting to regroup after Morgan's blindside, Domenick told Wendell he found a real idol. The next morning, he found the legacy advantage willed to him by Morgan.

^ a b c d e For winning the final Immunity Challenge, Domenick had to assign additional immunity to another castaway, with the remaining two competing in a fire-making challenge to determine the third finalist; he gave additional immunity to Laurel, and Wendell defeated Angela in the fire-making challenge.
Wendell chose to sacrifice his reward to be sent to Ghost Island, where he was guaranteed to win an advantage.
The Final Tribal Council vote resulted in a tie. As the finalist that finished in third place, Laurel became the 11th and final member of the jury to cast the deciding vote.
Reward/Immunity Challenge: Two pairs from each tribe will race through a series of obstacles in the water. They will then have to dive to release two sets of buoys. Another member will need to gather all of the marked buoys to the finish, where the last four members will need to get all eight in a basket to win immunity and a comfort reward of chairs, pillows, blankets, and a washboard.
The team of Angela, Chelsea, Donathan, Laurel, Libby, and Wendell won reward. They immediately had the others draw rocks for Ghost Island, with Jenna getting exiled; her urn was empty. While on reward, Libby asked why she received votes, and Angela said the others were wary of her bond with Michael. Back at camp, Michael talked to Angela about blindsiding Wendell. However, after Michael told her she was the only person left out of the loop on the last vote, Angela wanted to "stir the pot" and lied to her old Naviti tribemates about Michael saying that Kellyn and Chelsea didn't trust Angela, planning to target him.
Reward Challenge: While racing across a series of obstacles, castaways must untie and grab a sandbag. They will then attempt to throw that sandbag on a narrow table. The first castaway to get their sandbag on their table wins a feast of ribs, chicken, burgers, pastries, and ice cream with their loved one.
Reward Challenge: Divided into two teams of six via schoolyard pick, castaways will have to race across a floating balance beam to shore. Once they are ashore, they will need to use a slingshot to knock over six blocks on a perch using sandbags, with each member being required to launch at least once, then return to the beginning of the balance beam, where someone else goes out. The first team to knock all six blocks over win a feast of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and margaritas.
Immunity Challenge: Castaways will swim out to a platform, then cross a series of obstacles, collecting two sets of puzzle pieces. Using the puzzle pieces, castaways must finish a four-piece pyramid puzzle. The first castaway to finish their puzzle wins.
Wendell finished the puzzle first, but Laurel called Jeff's name first; by that rule, Laurel won immunity. She wanted to stick with Domenick and Wendell out of gratitude, and the three of them targeted Kellyn. However, a paranoid Donathan asked Domenick and Wendell if they were going to blindside him, making them reconsider their plans. Donathan then caught Domenick rummaging through his bag and giving Wendell something, prompting him to go back to Kellyn. Domenick, Wendell, Sebastian, and Angela debated on whether to vote out Donathan or Kellyn at the hammock. At Tribal Council, Donathan's paranoia took over, and an argument ensued between him and Wendell, as Domenick urged everyone else to stick to the "hammock plan." The vote was initially tied between Donathan and Kellyn, but Kellyn was sent to the jury on the revote.
The morning after Jacob's elimination, Jeff announced a tribe swap. The new Malolo tribe consisted of Bradley, Brendan, Chelsea, Desiree, Jenna, Kellyn, Michael, Sebastian, and Stephanie. The new Naviti tribe consisted of Angela, Chris, Domenick, Donathan, James, Laurel, Libby, Morgan, and Wendell. At the new Naviti tribe, Chris tried to rally votes against Domenick, but his attitude set Angela and Libby off. Morgan was suspicious of Chris, and she and Libby aligned. At the new Malolo tribe, Bradley's complaining over Malolo's shelter got on some people's nerves, while Michael and Brendan found one of James's idols from China.

Back at camp, Michael asked to borrow Donathan's idol, but Donathan immediately refused. To save himself, Michael told Kellyn he had an idol and would definitely play it. Kellyn bought Michael's ploy and told Domenick, who didn't believe it. She then told Chelsea and Wendell, and planned on using her extra vote to vote against Laurel twice, but Wendell considered turning on Kellyn to save Laurel. Meanwhile, Sebastian, Chelsea, and Angela planned on voting against Jenna, but they told her they would vote against Donathan. A paranoid Jenna tried to trick Donathan into playing his idol for her instead of himself at Purple's Tribal Council, while Donathan targeted Sebastian.
Host Jeff Probst explained the Ghost Island premise to the 20 new castaways upon their arrival, saying that they had a chance to reverse the curse of bad Survivor decisions if they were to visit Ghost Island. Jeff instructed each tribe to choose a leader: Malolo selected Brendan, while Chris volunteered for Naviti. Jeff also told the castaways they would only start with a machete, pot, a fishing kit, and a smaller supply of rice.
Naviti easily won after James could not even dive a foot in the water. Donathan panicked before eventually diving down and releasing the buoys for Malolo. Naviti sent Donathan to Ghost Island, and the urn he smashed was a dud. At Malolo, Stephanie considered working with Jacob to blindside Michael, but Jacob spilled the beans about the legacy advantage to Stephanie. At Tribal Council, Libby and Michael voted against James in case Jacob did indeed have a real idol, but ultimately, the tribe stuck to the original plan, sending Jacob out of the game.

This season marks the first time in Survivor history in which two players were tied for having the most jury votes at the Final Tribal Council. Domenick Abbate and Wendell Holland each received five votes from the jury, while Laurel Johnson received none. In order to break the tie, Johnson joined the jury and used her deciding vote to award the title of Sole Survivor to Holland.
After Tribal Council, Michael apologized to the Naviti alliance if they felt offended by his gameplay, and he was upset with himself about making the wrong decision over whom to play the idol for.

Wendell won immunity and chose to share reward with Sebastian and Angela. This upset Laurel, who voiced her anger to Domenick. Sebastian told Donathan and Angela he would use his extra vote to blindside Domenick, but Angela told Domenick, who considered playing his idol. Meanwhile, Donathan told Laurel about Sebastian's plan. At Tribal Council, Domenick outed Sebastian's extra vote and revealed his two idols, saying both were real when, in reality, one is fake. Wendell then pulled out his idol and offered to work with Donathan, who refused. Domenick presented the fake idol to Jeff before the votes were cast and chose not to play his real idol, and he was successful in fooling his tribemates. Sebastian didn't use his extra vote and was sent to the jury.

On Day 15, Jeff announced another tribe swap. The new Malolo tribe consisted of Angela, Desiree, James, Kellyn, and Michael. The new Naviti tribe consisted of Bradley, Chelsea, Domenick, Donathan, and Libby. A third tribe, Yanuya, consisted of Chris, Jenna, Laurel, Sebastian, and Wendell. On the newly formed Yanuya tribe, Chris's ego rubbed his new tribemates, especially Laurel, the wrong way. On the new Malolo tribe, Angela was still angry from her old tribemates' betrayal; she and James proceeded to inform their new tribemates about the cracks in the old Naviti tribe. Meanwhile, James was wary of Michael, as Michael had voted against him at Malolo's second Tribal Council. On the new Naviti tribe, Domenick immediately didn't trust Libby and voiced his concerns to Bradley.

Chelsea won immunity. Kellyn confronted Desiree and Chelsea about them wanting to turn on her, prompting Desiree to chew out Laurel in front of everyone else. Desiree adamantly tried to convince Kellyn she was loyal, while Domenick suggested a strong guy's alliance with Michael, to Kellyn's chagrin. At Tribal Council, Desiree and Laurel reignited their argument, but while Chelsea joined Desiree in voting against Michael, the rest of the tribe sent Desiree to the jury.
Immunity Challenge: Castaways will have to race out to two sets of tied planks, and use them to create a bridge to cross. Once they've crossed their bridge, castaways will have to complete two sets of ladders to climb a tower. At the top of the tower, they will then solve a slide puzzle. The first person to finish their puzzle wins immunity.
During the Final Tribal Council discussion, Laurel was largely ignored by the jury, who saw her as riding Domenick and Wendell's coattails when she could’ve made a move to blindside them. Meanwhile, Domenick was reprimanded for his actions at the Tribal Council where Sebastian was voted out. Much of the jury tried to figure out whether Domenick or Wendell were primarily responsible for controlling their alliance's moves. The jury went to vote, and Jeff surprised everyone by saying he would read the votes right then at the Final Tribal Council. For the first time in Survivor history, the vote was tied; Domenick and Wendell each had five votes. Jeff confirmed that Laurel would cast the winning vote as the 11th and final jury member.

Although Malolo had a huge lead through the chest-carrying stage, Naviti pulled off a massive comeback and edged out Malolo during the ball-tossing stage to win immunity, largely thanks to Chris's efforts. Stephanie was put off by Bradley's arrogant attitude and was even more offended when Bradley flat-out told her there was no hope for her alliance. The Naviti majority wanted to weaken the other alliance and Chelsea proposed voting out Michael or Brendan; the Naviti alliance proceeded to debate on which of the two to vote out. Michael revealed his idol to Stephanie and Jenna, which gave the alliance hope. At Tribal Council, Brendan declared Sebastian and Chelsea to be on the bottom of an alliance led by Bradley, and Michael encouraged them to flip after he pulled out his idol, falsely calling it a double immunity idol in an attempt to throw the opposing alliance off their game. Before the votes were read, Michael played his idol for Stephanie, but the Naviti majority voted against Brendan instead, sending him out of the game.
^ After the final Immunity Challenge, all of the remaining players went to Ghost Island. Domenick was given a symbolic decision on which “cursed urn” would hold the votes in the Final Tribal Council. This had no effect on the game.
Orange consisted of Domenick, Kellyn, Laurel, Michael, and Wendell, while Purple consisted of Angela, Chelsea, Donathan, Jenna, and Sebastian. Chelsea won immunity for Purple, but immediately dropped out before Domenick outlasted Wendell for the other immunity necklace and the right for Orange to visit Tribal Council last.
Naviti won immunity yet again. The Naviti majority debated on who to vote out; they decided that Jenna was an easy, safe vote, but Michael was the biggest threat. Jenna flirted with Sebastian to save herself, while Michael pled his case to Bradley, saying they needed him for the challenges. Desiree searched Stephanie's bag for an advantage and didn't find one. At Tribal Council, each of the original Malolo members pled their case, and Stephanie was unanimously voted out.

Immunity Challenge: Contestants must swim to a floating platform, run up it and jump off into the water. They must collect a set of floating rings and bring them back. Three people must swim over to a platform with the rings, and then toss the rings on to a floating target. The first two tribes to toss all their rings onto the target win immunity.
After Tribal Council, Libby was concerned as to why she received votes again, while Wendell told Laurel about his idol, making her wary of his power in the game.

On Day 20, the three tribes merged on Naviti's beach. Although the Naviti members initially planned on picking off the Malolo members, Chris and Domenick were still at odds; Wendell tried to play moderator, to no avail. Jenna and Libby considered whether to side with Chris or Domenick. Chris found a note randomly placed in his buff, which led him to find a clue in tree mail, saying the idol was on Ghost Island; he would travel there late that night while everyone else was asleep. He found J.T.'s Game Changers idol in plain sight, but it was only good at the next Tribal Council. However, a game of chance allowed him to extend the life of the idol for up to 5 extra Tribal Councils; there were 10 chests to choose from. He extended the idol once, but lost his vote at the next Tribal Council.
^ On Day 29, a double Tribal Council was held where the tribe was divided into two groups of five each; each group went to Tribal Council separately to eliminate one castaway from each.
After Chelsea's elimination, Donathan approached Kellyn with a plan to turn against Domenick and Wendell.
Before the challenge, Jeff revealed that someone would visit Ghost Island and return before the immunity challenge, meaning they would also be vulnerable if their tribe were to visit Tribal Council. Naviti won the challenge and immediately chose to have Malolo draw rocks; Kellyn was sent to Ghost Island immediately after she explained that being separated was her worst Survivor fear. Although the urn she smashed allowed her to play the game of chance, she decided not to risk losing her vote. At Naviti, a confused and angry Chris learned from Angela about Domenick's alliance's betrayal; they planned on aligning with the former Malolo members, but Donathan talked to Wendell about working together and Laurel talked to Domenick, who revealed his idol to her.

At the merge, Domenick led the tribe in eliminating Chris before the majority began picking off the remaining original Malolos. However, they began to turn on the female Naviti alliance members, sending Chelsea and Kellyn home when the two led a charge to turn on Domenick and Wendell. Both Domenick and Wendell had hidden immunity idols; Donathan later turned against them to try and flush their idols, but he was unable to rally enough votes against them and was eliminated.

The final 6 returned to camp, where Sebastian secretly plotted on making a move against Domenick and Wendell, who in turn targeted him for his likeability.
Domenick won immunity. He and Wendell planned on bringing in Laurel to blindside Chelsea for being a physical threat, while the women wanted to bring in Donathan to blindside Wendell, who Chelsea felt was the biggest threat in the game. Donathan and Laurel privately weighed their options; Donathan was antsy to make a move, but Laurel wanted to stay true to her alliance with Domenick and Wendell. At Tribal Council, Donathan revealed there were cracks in the Naviti alliance, putting his tribemates on edge. In the end, Donathan and Laurel voted against Chelsea, sending her to the jury.
Wendell played a hidden immunity idol on Laurel, therefore one vote against her was not counted.
Reward Challenge: The castaways will be divided into three teams of two, where they will place a wooden spool onto a track which will roll to the bottom of the structure where one castaway will grab it and place it back onto the track. At regular intervals, more spools will be added, making it more difficult. If a spool drops, they're out of the challenge. Last team left standing wins the right to deliver supplies to a local Fijian school on Yanuya along with a meal of fried chicken and chocolate cake.

Despite being targeted for this, he and the others voted out a big threat in Ricard when he was not immune. Xander won the final challenge and brought Erika to the end in hopes that she wouldn't get to add beating someone at fire to her resume. Deshawn narrowly beat Heather to join them in the final three.

For winning the final Immunity Challenge, Xander had to assign additional immunity to another player, with the remaining two competing in a fire-making challenge to determine the third finalist; he gave additional immunity to Erika.
In 2022, Shan Smith and Danny McCray competed on The Challenge: USA.[30]
Xander said his secret phrase, but was met with silence from the other tribes. Luvu placed first and Ua placed second after Tiffany struggled for Yase in the challenge. For placing first, Luvu had to send someone from Yase and someone either from their own tribe or from Ua to go on a journey. They chose Evvie, then Deshawn volunteered. During their time together, Evvie told Deshawn how idols worked this season and expressed that her vote was crucial, urging him to risk his so he could get an extra vote and that they could work together in the future. Back at Yase, the girls planned on blindsiding Xander until Tiffany grew paranoid over Xander playing an idol (though it didn’t have power yet), proposing voting out Voce instead. This made Evvie and Liana consider voting out Tiffany to preserve strength, but at Tribal Council, the women stuck together to blindside Voce from the game.

Erika was exiled after not being chosen to join the winning team's reward and share in their immunity. At Exile Island, she was given the opportunity to either keep the game moving as is, allowing the winning team to keep their immunity, or go back in time and change the outcome, in which she and the losing team would be given immunity instead. Her decision, which was not revealed until the next episode, was to change the outcome and give immunity to the losing team, a move that occurred after the original winning team had enjoyed their reward.
This season was originally to be entitled Survivor: Dawn of a New Era according to Jeff Probst, although production and filming was initially scheduled to start on March 24, 2020, and was to conclude on May 1 onto a standard 39 days of gameplay, but it was pushed back until 2021 due to surrounding international travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Usually, the show releases two seasons per television season year—one debuting around the fall (September) and the other debuting around late winter/early spring (February or March). But due to the pandemic, the Survivor crew was not able to produce this and the subsequent 42nd season in 2020. Production had considered filming domestically in Georgia or Hawaii, but the unpredictability of the pandemic pushed filming back to 2021.[9][10] On February 11, 2021, Faiyaz Koya, the Fijian Minister of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport, approved filming for this season with the crew required to arrive in groups and quarantine before filming.[11] On March 22, 2021, Jeff Probst announced on-location that production of this season was set to start and filming finally began on April 15.[12] The forty-first season debuted in September 2021.[13]

Immunity Challenge: Tribes swam to shore with a heavy bag of blocks, which they untied on the beach. They used the blocks to push out smaller blocks through a tunnel, one of which had a key to a chest that had three rings. The first two tribes to toss all three rings onto hooks won immunity; the losing tribe had to forfeit their flint until the next immunity challenge.
By accepting one of the "Beware Advantages," this castaway was unable to vote until either the same advantage was found by someone on all three tribes or the tribes merged.
Both Liana and Deshawn were upset following Tribal Council, the former for her closest ally being blindsided and the latter for being called a snake by Shan upon her exit. The four outside the alliance of Danny-Deshawn-Liana agreed to align. The next morning, Danny confided in Deshawn about the passing of his father 25 years earlier and how he has slowly been letting go of the negative emotions surrounding it.

Survivor 41 is the forty-first season of the American competition television series Survivor. The season was first broadcast on September 22, 2021, on CBS in the United States and Global in Canada.[1][2]It ended on December 15, 2021, when Erika Casupanan was voted the Sole Survivor, defeating Deshawn Radden and Xander Hastings in a 7–1–0 vote. Casupanan also became the first Canadian castaway to win the title,[note 1] the third Asian castaway to win (following Yul Kwon in season 13, Survivor: Cook Islands and Natalie Anderson in season 29, Survivor: San Juan del Sur), the first of Filipino descent to win, and the first woman to win in seven seasons, the last one being Sarah Lacina in season 34, Survivor: Game Changers.[5]

All of the Ua tribe searched for the idol which was found by allies Brad and Genie. Brad also disclosed their discovery to Shan so as to build trust. Additionally, Brad found a second “Beware” advantage requiring him to travel to a separate island or else lose his vote. Tiffany had likewise found a similar note on Yase, as did Sydney on Luvu. Once on the separate island, the three were faced with a decision: a steal-a-vote or a tarp. If all three chose tarp, all three tribes would receive a tarp. If all three chose steal-a-vote, all three lost their next vote. A split decision meant those who chose tarp would get nothing and those who chose steal-a-vote got the advantage; only Brad chose the steal-a-vote. At Luvu, Naseer proposed blindsiding Danny, but that turned Sydney against him for strategizing too much.

They discussed going to the final three together due to their differing styles of gameplay, with Deshawn trying to convince Erika that her and Heather's games would be seen as too similar by the jury. At camp, Danny searched for an idol but came up empty, and Ricard noted his absence from camp.
Erika rejoined her tribemates the next morning at the first individual immunity challenge and revealed she chose to smash the hourglass, taking immunity away from the winning team and giving it to herself, Heather, Liana, Shan, Tiffany, and Xander.

Unlike most Survivor seasons, it is a shortened season spanning only 26 out of the usual 39 days, due to the COVID-19 pandemic requiring all cast and production members to quarantine for 14 days and taking up some of the short production time.[14][15] For the first time since Survivor: Borneo, the season's winner was revealed during the Final Tribal Council as production was unsure on the ability to have a live finale due to the concerns of a potential COVID-19 resurgence. The vote reveal was then followed by a Survivor After Show special with the final players and the jury instead of a live reunion.[16]
At the start of the individual phase of the game on Day 12, castaways had to earn their way into the merged tribe by either winning immunity or surviving the Day 14 Tribal Council.

At Ua, JD and Ricard discussed voting out Brad by the water well, but Brad eavesdropped on the conversation from the bushes. He told Shan, who relayed Brad’s suspicions to Ricard. At Luvu, Deshawn struggled with starting a fire, so Naseer stepped in to help, earning Sydney’s respect. At Yase, Tiffany expressed how exhausting the season was for her, and Xander searched for an advantage. He found a “Beware” advantage: an idol that only works when someone from all three tribes found their respective ones (having to say a secret phrase at a challenge to confirm the idols are in power). Until then, Xander would not be able to vote at Tribal Council. He told Voce and Evvie, the latter of which told Liana and Tiffany in hopes of forming an all-girls alliance.
In addition, Probst announced a new interactive element called The Game Within the Game, in which children watching at home were invited to play along with the show, solving a rebus puzzle hidden somewhere within the episode. Also, at-home viewers could solve a word-scramble puzzle online and be given a strategy discussion test in which the viewers could discuss the strategy and later compare it with what really happened during the next episode's airing.[23]
Xander won the challenge, and the other castaways made their pitches to him for Tribal Council. Deshawn and Heather both stressed that Erika was the biggest threat left in the game, while Erika downplayed her threat level. Xander believed Erika was a strong firemaker and did not want her to get the opportunity to win the firemaking challenge, so he elected to take her to Final 3 with him. Deshawn and Heather competed in the firemaking challenge; Heather had a strong flame early that faltered, allowing Deshawn time to build his own flame and burn through the rope, advancing to the Final 3 seconds before Heather’s own rope burned. Heather became the final member of the jury.
Brad said his secret phrase before the challenge started, but no one on Luvu had yet found the idol. Luvu and Yase won the challenge. JD and Ricard agreed to vote out Brad, while Genie targeted JD. Brad lost his vote due to Luvu’s idol being undiscovered. Shan was the swing vote; at Tribal Council, she sided with JD and Ricard to blindside Brad with two advantages in his pocket.

Luvu jumped to an early lead, while Yase did not put up a contest. However, Luvu failed to unclip the anchor of their boat, leading to Ua pulling away with the victory. While setting up the tribe's camp, JD started Ua's fire and forged bonds with his tribemates, but some of them saw his attempts as overbearing. Shan, however, approached JD for an alliance.

Jeff offered the castaways to sit out for a single serving of rice, or enough rice to last three days if seven people stepped out of the challenge. After renegotiating it to five, Shan and Naseer agreed to give up their shot at immunity, but nobody else budged. Xander offered to step down if four castaways took the offer, and Ricard did the same, giving the tribe the rice. Evvie outlasted Heather for immunity. At camp, the majority agreed to split the votes between Xander and Tiffany. Naseer’s name was thrown out as a decoy vote, but his reaction made the majority change that to Heather. Deshawn worried that Naseer was a bigger threat than Xander, but Shan shut that down quickly, offending Deshawn. The plan to make Heather the decoy vote got back to Heather, who confronted Shan and realized that she has been leading to where everyone was voting.

Dominated by a women's alliance, they made up for the numbers deficit while Ua dwindled down to just Shan and Ricard. Their strong partnership enabled them to reach the merge, where they initially aligned with Luvu against the surviving Yase members.

The season received a mixed response, with many praising the cast and their gameplay as well as the entertaining episodes and unpredictability of the season and Erika’s win, but criticizing the overabundance of twists and advantages, as well as the overall edit and new format of the season. Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly ranked this season 21st out of 41.[46] Gordon Holmes of Xfinity called it a mid-level season saying "I think I'll remember this season as having an awesome diverse cast, that was somewhat overshadowed by the need to cram 20 pounds of advantages into a 10-pound bag."[47] Andy Dehnart of reality blurred praised the cast but was highly critical towards the overabundance of twists and advantages.[48] Outlets including TVLine, Insider, and Screen Rant expressed similar criticisms towards the number of twists in this season.[49][50][51] Harper Lambert of TheWrap was more critical of the cast due to a "near-total lack of conflict and striking personalities."[52] Riley McAtee of The Ringer was more positive towards this season due to the fewer amount of twists after the merge saying that it was "against all odds, given the changes to the format–a pretty good season of Survivor."[53]

Filming in Fiji, the ninth consecutive season at that location, had been planned to start filming from March to May 2020, with the season scheduled to air on CBS starting in September 2020 as a part of the 2020–21 television season, but worldwide travel restrictions and Fiji's border closures forced production to postpone to a year in March 2021, and the broadcast pushed into the 2021–22 television season.[8]
Genie found a new "Beware" idol and immediately showed Ricard and Shan to use as a group idol for the merge, but Shan had her keep it concealed and hidden so that she could secretly make a fake idol and obtain the real one for herself. She would say the phrase to see if anyone from Luvu had found their idol and would keep the idol hidden so that she could still vote. She also gave her extra vote to Ricard in case it wouldn't need to be used yet. At Luvu, Deshawn and Danny tried to recruit a reluctant Naseer to help them throw the next immunity challenge to vote out Erika, while at Yase, Tiffany and Liana searched Xander's bag and discovered his extra vote on top of his idol.

Erika won immunity but dropped out soon afterward, and Xander outlasted Deshawn for immunity. The yellow group was exiled to Ua's camp, where Naseer told Heather she would be the one to go. This prompted Erika to approach Ricard and Shan about blindsiding Naseer and flushing his idol while he felt comfortable; Ricard was more willing to join Erika than Shan was. At yellow's Tribal Council, Heather acted as though she would be voted out, and Naseer didn't play his idol. Shan used her extra vote to cast one each against Heather and Naseer, resulting in a 3-3 tie that led to a revote, in which Naseer was unanimously sent to the jury.
Erika drew the odd rock again, but Xander offered to sit out in her place. He searched the sit-out bench for an advantage but was unable to find it, and the blue team (Danny, Deshawn, Erika, Evvie, and Ricard) won the challenge. After the feast, Ricard aggravated Shan by eating a piece of a papaya that Naseer collected for the losing tribemates.

During tribal, Shan again frustrated Deshawn after shooting his idea down. In the end, Xander and Naseer opted not to play their idols, and while both of them along with Heather received votes, the majority decided to play it safe as Tiffany was sent to the jury.
Reward Challenge: The tribe was divided into two teams of five by random draw, with one castaway ineligible for reward.

As punishment for losing the opening challenge, Luvu and Yase had four hours to either solve a puzzle or nominate two tribe members to carry ocean water to fill two large buckets. Both tribes selected the latter task; Danny and Deshawn went for Luvu, while Voce (reluctantly) and Xander went for Yase. While both pairs were successful, Naseer reported to his tribemates that he believed the former pair were looking for an idol during the task, which set the two of them against Naseer. At Yase, Abraham expressed concerns about Tiffany's performance in the opening challenge, and Liana relayed this to Tiffany.

^ Shan's extra vote advantage carried over into the revote, allowing her to cast two ballots once more.
This season introduced many new twists, including the "Shot in the Dark" which offered players at Tribal Council a chance for immunity in exchange for giving up one's vote, the "Beware Advantage" which restricted players' ability to vote until their immunity idols became active, and decision games which forced players to make game-altering choices. One such decision game featured players making opposing—but not necessarily different—choices to either risk or protect their votes in a manner similar to a game of Chicken.[18] Other games of decision included the "Hourglass" twist which gave one player the opportunity to reverse the outcome of a group immunity challenge at the risk of earning tribemates' ire,[19] and the "Do or Die" twist which, in one instance, made the first player to lose an Immunity Challenge perform a risky game of chance similar to the Monty Hall problem just to be able to stay in the game.[20][21]
The episode ended on a cliffhanger and no one was voted out.

Heather and Liana chose not to participate, and Deshawn immediately fell out first. After Erika dropped, Ricard and Xander were eliminated within milliseconds of each other, giving Danny the win. In case Deshawn became safe from Do or Die, the new majority targeted Liana as the only non-immune player from that alliance while the other three targeted Ricard as the biggest perceived threat. However, Erika privately considered flipping to blindside Ricard. At Tribal Council, Deshawn became emotional over his vote against Shan, leading to a healthy discussion about racial equality among the tribe. Deshawn had a 1-in-3 chance at safety, and he chose the correct box to become immune from the vote. Ultimately, Erika stayed with her alliance and Xander used his extra vote, sending Liana to the jury.

It was during his stint with the Kings that he became a solid backup to center Vlade Divac, often starting at power forward when Chris Webber was injured.
