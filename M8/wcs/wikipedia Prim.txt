As described above, the starting vertex for the algorithm will be chosen arbitrarily, because the first iteration of the main loop of the algorithm will have a set of vertices in Q that all have equal weights, and the algorithm will automatically start a new tree in F when it completes a spanning tree of each connected component of the input graph. The algorithm may be modified to start with any particular vertex s by setting C[s] to be a number smaller than the other values of C (for instance, zero), and it may be modified to only find a single spanning tree rather than an entire spanning forest (matching more closely the informal description) by stopping whenever it encounters another vertex flagged as having no associated edge.
Create C, E, F, and Q as in the sequential algorithm and divide C, E, as well as the graph between all processors such that each processor holds the incoming edges to its set of vertices. Let Ci{\displaystyle C_{i}}, Ei{\displaystyle E_{i}} denote the parts of C, E stored on processor Pi{\displaystyle P_{i}}.
In computer science, Prim's algorithm (also known as Jarník's algorithm) is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.

Different variations of the algorithm differ from each other in how the set Q is implemented: as a simple linked list or array of vertices, or as a more complicated priority queue data structure. This choice leads to differences in the time complexity of the algorithm. In general, a priority queue will be quicker at finding the vertex v with minimum cost, but will entail more expensive updates when the value of C[w] changes.
The algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník[1] and later rediscovered and republished by computer scientists Robert C. Prim in 1957[2] and Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1959.[3] Therefore, it is also sometimes called the Jarník's algorithm,[4] Prim–Jarník algorithm,[5] Prim–Dijkstra algorithm[6]or the DJP algorithm.[7]

A simple implementation of Prim's, using an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list graph representation and linearly searching an array of weights to find the minimum weight edge to add, requires O(|V|2) running time. However, this running time can be greatly improved further by using heaps to implement finding minimum weight edges in the algorithm's inner loop.

This algorithm can generally be implemented on distributed machines[12] as well as on shared memory machines.[13] The running time is O(|V|2|P|)+O(|V|log⁡|P|){\displaystyle O({\tfrac {|V|^{2}}{|P|}})+O(|V|\log |P|)}, assuming that the reduce and broadcast operations can be performed in O(log⁡|P|){\displaystyle O(\log |P|)}.[12] A variant of Prim's algorithm for shared memory machines, in which Prim's sequential algorithm is being run in parallel, starting from different vertices, has also been explored.[14] It should, however, be noted that more sophisticated algorithms exist to solve the distributed minimum spanning tree problem in a more efficient manner.
The algorithm may informally be described as performing the following steps:
Assign each processors Pi{\displaystyle P_{i}} a set Vi{\displaystyle V_{i}} of consecutive vertices of length |V||P|{\displaystyle {\tfrac {|V|}{|P|}}}.

The time complexity of Prim's algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph and for ordering the edges by weight, which can be done using a priority queue. The following table shows the typical choices:

Let P be a connected, weighted graph.At every iteration of Prim's algorithm, an edge must be found that connects a vertex in a subgraph to a vertex outside the subgraph.SinceP is connected, there will always be a path to every vertex.The output Y of Prim's algorithm is a tree, because the edge and vertex added to tree Y are connected. Let Y1 be a minimum spanning tree of graph P. If Y1=Y then Y is a minimum spanning tree. Otherwise, let e be the first edge added during the construction of tree Y that is not in tree Y1, and V be the set of vertices connected by the edges added before edge e.Then one endpoint of edge e is in set V and the other is not.Since tree Y1 is a spanning tree of graph P, there is a path in tree Y1 joining the two endpoints.As one travels along the path, one must encounter an edge f joining a vertex in set V to one that is not in set V.Now, at the iteration when edge e was added to tree Y, edge f could also have been added and it would be added instead of edge e if its weight was less than e, and since edge f was not added, we conclude that
Grow the tree by one edge: of the edges that connect the tree to vertices not yet in the tree, find the minimum-weight edge, and transfer it to the tree.
On every processor: find the vertex vi{\displaystyle v_{i}} having the minimum value in Ci{\displaystyle C_{i}}[vi{\displaystyle v_{i}}] (local solution).

Add v to F and, if E[v] is not the special flag value, also add E[v] to F.
Other well-known algorithms for this problem include Kruskal's algorithm and Borůvka's algorithm.[8] These algorithms find the minimum spanning forest in a possibly disconnected graph; in contrast, the most basic form of Prim's algorithm only finds minimum spanning trees in connected graphs. However, running Prim's algorithm separately for each connected component of the graph, it can also be used to find the minimum spanning forest.[9] In terms of their asymptotic time complexity, these three algorithms are equally fast for sparse graphs, but slower than other more sophisticated algorithms.[7][6]However, for graphs that are sufficiently dense, Prim's algorithm can be made to run in linear time, meeting or improving the time bounds for other algorithms.[10]

Let tree Y2 be the graph obtained by removing edge f from and adding edge e to tree Y1.It is easy to show that tree Y2 is connected, has the same number of edges as tree Y1, and the total weights of its edges is not larger than that of tree Y1, therefore it is also a minimum spanning tree of graph P and it contains edge e and all the edges added before it during the construction of set V.Repeat the steps above and we will eventually obtain a minimum spanning tree of graph P that is identical to tree Y.This shows Y is a minimum spanning tree. The minimum spanning tree allows for the first subset of the sub-region to be expanded into a smaller subset X, which we assume to be the minimum.
Initialize an empty forest F and a set Q of vertices that have not yet been included in F (initially, all vertices).
Greedoids offer a general way to understand the correctness of Prim's algorithm
Initialize a tree with a single vertex, chosen arbitrarily from the graph.
Using a simple binary heap data structure, Prim's algorithm can now be shown to run in time O(|E| log |V|) where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices. Using a more sophisticated Fibonacci heap, this can be brought down to O(|E| + |V| log |V|), which is asymptotically faster when the graph is dense enough that |E| is ω(|V|), and linear time when |E| is at least |V| log |V|. For graphs of even greater density (having at least |V|c edges for some c > 1), Prim's algorithm can be made to run in linear time even more simply, by using a d-ary heap in place of a Fibonacci heap.[10][11]

Associate with each vertex v of the graph a number C[v] (the cheapest cost of a connection to v) and an edge E[v] (the edge providing that cheapest connection). To initialize these values, set all values of C[v] to +∞ (or to any number larger than the maximum edge weight) and set each E[v] to a special flag value indicating that there is no edge connecting v to earlier vertices.
Repeat the following steps until Q is empty:Find and remove a vertex v from Q having the minimum possible value of C[v]Add v to FLoop over the edges vw connecting v to other vertices w. For each such edge, if w still belongs to Q and vw has smaller weight than C[w], perform the following steps:Set C[w] to the cost of edge vwSet E[w] to point to edge vw.

Dijkstra's algorithm, a very similar algorithm for the shortest path problem
Repeat step 2 (until all vertices are in the tree).
A first improved version uses a heap to store all edges of the input graph, ordered by their weight. This leads to an O(|E| log |E|) worst-case running time. But storing vertices instead of edges can improve it still further. The heap should order the vertices by the smallest edge-weight that connects them to any vertex in the partially constructed minimum spanning tree (MST) (or infinity if no such edge exists). Every time a vertex v is chosen and added to the MST, a decrease-key operation is performed on all vertices w outside the partial MST such that v is connected to w, setting the key to the minimum of its previous value and the edge cost of (v,w).
The main loop of Prim's algorithm is inherently sequential and thus not parallelizable. However, the inner loop, which determines the next edge of minimum weight that does not form a cycle, can be parallelized by dividing the vertices and edges between the available processors.[12] The following pseudocode demonstrates this.

A text search operation could be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on the system, application, or context. The user can in many cases specify whether a search is sensitive to case, e.g. in most text editors, word processors, and Web browsers.A case-insensitive search is more comprehensive, finding "Language" (at the beginning of a sentence), "language", and "LANGUAGE" (in a title in capitals); a case-sensitive search will find the computer language "BASIC" but exclude most of the many unwanted instances of the word. For example, the Google Search engine is basically case-insensitive, with no option for case-sensitive search.[5]In Oracle SQL most operations and searches are case-sensitive by default,[6] while in most other DBMS's SQL searches are case-insensitive by default.[7]
URLs: The path, query, fragment, and authority sections of a URL may or may not be case-sensitive, depending on the receiving web server. The scheme and host parts, however, are strictly lowercase.

Passwords: Authentication systems usually treat passwords as case-sensitive. This enables the users to increase the complexity of their passwords.
Usernames: Authentication systems usually treat usernames as case-insensitive to make them easier to remember, reducing typing complexity, and eliminate the possibility of both mistakes and fraud when two usernames are identical in every aspect except the case of one of their letters. However, these systems are not case-blind. They preserve the case of the characters in the name so that users may choose an aesthetically pleasing username combination.
File names: Traditionally, Unix-like operating systems treat file names case-sensitively while Microsoft Windows is case-insensitive but, for most file systems, case-preserving. For more details, see below.
In computers, case sensitivity defines whether uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct (case-sensitive) or equivalent (case-insensitive). For instance, when users interested in learning about dogs search an e-book, "dog" and "Dog" are of the same significance to them. Thus, they request a case-insensitive search. But when they search an online encyclopedia for information about the United Nations, for example, or something with no ambiguity regarding capitalization and ambiguity between two or more terms cut down by capitalization, they may prefer a case-sensitive search.

The older MS-DOS filesystems FAT12 and FAT16 were case-insensitive and not case-preserving, so that a file whose name is entered as readme.txt or ReadMe.txt is saved as README.TXT. Later, with VFAT in Windows 95 the FAT file systems became case-preserving as an extension of supporting long filenames.[8] Later Windows file systems such as NTFS are internally case-sensitive, and a readme.txt and a Readme.txt can coexist in the same directory. However, for practical purposes filenames behave as case-insensitive as far as users and most software are concerned.[9] This can cause problems for developers or software coming from Unix-like environments, similar to the problems with macOS case-insensitive file systems.

In filesystems in Unix-like systems, filenames are usually case-sensitive (there can be separate readme.txt and Readme.txt files in the same directory). MacOS is somewhat unusual in that, by default, it uses HFS+ and APFS in a case-insensitive (so that there cannot be a readme.txt and a Readme.txt in the same directory) but case-preserving mode (so that a file created as readme.txt is shown as readme.txt and a file created as Readme.txt is shown as Readme.txt) by default. This causes some issues for developers and power users, because most file systems in other Unix-like environments are case-sensitive, and, for example, a source code tree for software for Unix-like systems might have both a file named Makefile and a file named makefile in the same directory. In addition, some Mac Installers assume case insensitivity and fail on case-sensitive file systems.

Searching: Users expect information retrieval systems to be able to have correct case sensitivity depending on the nature of an operation. Users looking for the word "dog" in an online journal probably do not wish to differentiate between "dog" or "Dog", as this is a writing distinction; the word should be matched whether it appears at the beginning of a sentence or not. On the other hand, users looking for information about a brand name, trademark, human name, or city name may be interested in performing a case-sensitive operation to filter out irrelevant results. For example, somebody searching for the name "Jade" would not want to find references to the mineral called "jade". On the English Wikipedia for example a search for Friendly fire returns the military article but Friendly Fire (capitalized "Fire") returns the disambiguation page.[NB 1][1]

Some programming languages are case-sensitive for their identifiers (C, C++, Java, C#, Verilog,[2] Ruby,[3] Python and Swift). Others are case-insensitive (i.e., not case-sensitive), such as ABAP, Ada, most BASICs (an exception being BBC BASIC), Fortran, SQL (for the syntax, and for some vendor implementations, e.g. Microsoft SQL Server, the data itself)[NB 2] and Pascal.There are also languages, such as Haskell, Prolog, and Go, in which the capitalisation of an identifier encodes information about its semantics. Some other programming languages have varying case sensitivity; in PHP, for example, variable names are case-sensitive but function names are not case-sensitive. This means that if you define a function in lowercase, you can call it in uppercase, but if you define a variable in lowercase, you cannot refer to it in uppercase. Nim is case-insensitive and ignores underscores, as long as the first characters match.[4]

However, at some point order needs to be introduced to the heap to achieve the desired running time. In particular, degrees of nodes (here degree means the number of direct children) are kept quite low: every node has degree at most log n and the size of a subtree rooted in a node of degree k is at least Fk+2, where Fk is the kth Fibonacci number. This is achieved by the rule that we can cut at most one child of each non-root node. When a second child is cut, the node itself needs to be cut from its parent and becomes the root of a new tree (see Proof of degree bounds, below). The number of trees is decreased in the operation delete minimum, where trees are linked together.
Operation find minimum is now trivial because we keep the pointer to the node containing it. It does not change the potential of the heap, therefore both actual and amortized cost are constant.
As mentioned above, merge is implemented simply by concatenating the lists of tree roots of the two heaps. This can be done in constant time and the potential does not change, leading again to constant amortized time.

Although the total running time of a sequence of operations starting with an empty structure is bounded by the bounds given above, some (very few) operations in the sequence can take very long to complete (in particular delete and delete minimum have linear running time in the worst case). For this reason Fibonacci heaps and other amortized data structures may not be appropriate for real-time systems. It is possible to create a data structure which has the same worst-case performance as the Fibonacci heap has amortized performance. One such structure, the Brodal queue,[4] is, in the words of the creator, "quite complicated" and "[not] applicable in practice." Created in 2012, the strict Fibonacci heap[5] is a simpler (compared to Brodal's) structure with the same worst-case bounds. Despite having simpler structure, experiments show that in practice the strict Fibonacci heap performs slower than more complicated Brodal queue and also slower than basic Fibonacci heap.[6][7] The run-relaxed heaps of Driscoll et al. give good worst-case performance for all Fibonacci heap operations except merge.

Using Fibonacci heaps for priority queues improves the asymptotic running time of important algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, compared to the same algorithm using other slower priority queue data structures.

For the Fibonacci heap, the find-minimum operation takes constant (O(1)) amortized time.[1] The insert and decrease key operations also work in constant amortized time.[2] Deleting an element (most often used in the special case of deleting the minimum element) works in O(log n) amortized time, where n is the size of the heap.[2] This means that starting from an empty data structure, any sequence of a insert and decrease key operations and b delete operations would take O(a + b log n) worst case time, where n is the maximum heap size. In a binary or binomial heap, such a sequence of operations would take O((a + b) log n) time. A Fibonacci heap is thus better than a binary or binomial heap when b is smaller than a by a non-constant factor. It is also possible to merge two Fibonacci heaps in constant amortized time, improving on the logarithmic merge time of a binomial heap, and improving on binary heaps which cannot handle merges efficiently.

Operation extract minimum (same as delete minimum) operates in three phases. First we take the root containing the minimum element and remove it. Its children will become roots of new trees. If the number of children was d, it takes time O(d) to process all new roots and the potential increases by d−1. Therefore, the amortized running time of this phase is O(d) = O(log n).
In the third phase we check each of the remaining roots and find the minimum. This takes O(log n) time and the potential does not change. The overall amortized running time of extract minimum is therefore O(log n).

In computer science, a Fibonacci heap is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection ofheap-ordered trees. It has a better amortized running time than many other priority queue data structures including the binary heap and binomial heap. Michael L. Fredman and Robert E. Tarjan developed Fibonacci heaps in 1984 and published them in a scientific journal in 1987. Fibonacci heaps are named after the Fibonacci numbers, which are used in their running time analysis.

A Fibonacci heap is a collection of trees satisfying the minimum-heap property, that is, the key of a child is always greater than or equal to the key of the parent. This implies that the minimum key is always at the root of one of the trees. Compared with binomial heaps, the structure of a Fibonacci heap is more flexible. The trees do not have a prescribed shape and in the extreme case the heap can have every element in a separate tree. This flexibility allows some operations to be executed in a lazy manner, postponing the work for later operations. For example, merging heaps is done simply by concatenating the two lists of trees, and operation decrease key sometimes cuts a node from its parent and forms a new tree.

where t is the number of trees in the Fibonacci heap, and m is the number of marked nodes. A node is marked if at least one of its children was cut since this node was made a child of another node (all roots are unmarked).The amortized time for an operation is given by the sum of the actual time and c times the difference in potential, where c is a constant (chosen to match the constant factors in the O notation for the actual time).
Finally, operation delete can be implemented simply by decreasing the key of the element to be deleted to minus infinity, thus turning it into the minimum of the whole heap. Then we call extract minimum to remove it. The amortized running time of this operation is O(log n).

However to complete the extract minimum operation, we need to update the pointer to the root with minimum key. Unfortunately there may be up to n roots we need to check. In the second phase we therefore decrease the number of roots by successively linking together roots of the same degree. When two roots u and v have the same degree, we make one of them a child of the other so that the one with the smaller key remains the root. Its degree will increase by one. This is repeated until every root has a different degree. To find trees of the same degree efficiently we use an array of length O(log n) in which we keep a pointer to one root of each degree. When a second root is found of the same degree, the two are linked and the array is updated. The actual running time is O(log n + m) where m is the number of roots at the beginning of the second phase. At the end we will have at most O(log n) roots (because each has a different degree). Therefore, the difference in the potential function from before this phase to after it is: O(log n) − m, and the amortized running time is then at most O(log n + m) + c(O(log n) − m). With a sufficiently large choice of c, this simplifies to O(log n).

As a result of a relaxed structure, some operations can take a long time while others are done very quickly. For the amortized running time analysis, we use the potential method, in that we pretend that very fast operations take a little bit longer than they actually do. This additional time is then later combined and subtracted from the actual running time of slow operations. The amount of time saved for later use is measured at any given moment by a potential function. The potential of a Fibonacci heap is given by

To allow fast deletion and concatenation, the roots of all trees are linked using a circular doubly linked list. The children of each node are also linked using such a list. For each node, we maintain its number of children and whether the node is marked. Moreover, we maintain a pointer to the root containing the minimum key.

Base case: If x has height 0, then d = 0, and size(x) = 1 = F2.
Inductive case:Suppose x has positive height and degree d > 0.Let y1, y2, ..., yd be the children of x, indexed in order of the times they were most recently made children of x (y1 being the earliest and yd the latest), and let c1, c2, ..., cd be their respective degrees.We claim that ci ≥ i-2 for each i with 2 ≤ i ≤ d: Just before yi was made a child of x, y1,...,yi−1 were already children of x, and so x had degree at least i−1 at that time.Since trees are combined only when the degrees of their roots are equal, it must have been that yi also had degree at least i-1 at the time it became a child of x.From that time to the present, yi can only have lost at most one child (as guaranteed by the marking process), and so its current degree ci is at least i−2.This proves the claim.
They are not as efficient in practice when compared with the theoretically less efficient forms of heaps. In their simplest version they require storage and manipulation of four pointers per node, whereas only two or three pointers per node are needed in other structures, such as Binary heap, Binomial heap, Pairing heap, Brodal queue and Rank pairing heap.

Thus, the root of each tree in a heap has one unit of time stored. This unit of time can be used later to link this tree with another tree at amortized time 0. Also, each marked node has two units of time stored. One can be used to cut the node from its parent. If this happens, the node becomes a root and the second unit of time will remain stored in it as in any other root.
Although Fibonacci heaps look very efficient, they have the following two drawbacks:[3]

Operation decrease key will take the node, decrease the key and if the heap property becomes violated (the new key is smaller than the key of the parent), the node is cut from its parent. If the parent is not a root, it is marked. If it has been marked already, it is cut as well and its parent is marked. We continue upwards until we reach either the root or an unmarked node. Now we set the minimum pointer to the decreased value if it is the new minimum. In the process we create some number, say k, of new trees. Each of these new trees except possibly the first one was marked originally but as a root it will become unmarked. One node can become marked. Therefore, the number of marked nodes changes by −(k − 1) + 1 = − k + 2. Combining these 2 changes, the potential changes by 2(−k + 2) + k = −k + 4. The actual time to perform the cutting was O(k), therefore (again with a sufficiently large choice of c) the amortized running time is constant.
Since the heights of all the yi are strictly less than that of x, we can apply the inductive hypothesis to them to get size(yi) ≥ Fci+2 ≥ F(i−2)+2 = Fi.The nodes x and y1 each contribute at least 1 to size(x), and so we have

Consider any node x somewhere in the heap (x need not be the root of one of the main trees).Define size(x) to be the size of the tree rooted at x (the number of descendants of x, including x itself).We prove by induction on the height of x (the length of a longest simple path from x to a descendant leaf), that size(x) ≥ Fd+2, where d is the degree of x.
Operation insert works by creating a new heap with one element and doing merge. This takes constant time, and the potential increases by one, because the number of trees increases. The amortized cost is thus still constant.
Fibonacci heaps have a reputation for being slow in practice[18] due to large memory consumption per node and high constant factors on all operations.Recent experimental results suggest that Fibonacci heaps are more efficient in practice than most of its later derivatives, including quake heaps, violation heaps, strict Fibonacci heaps, rank pairing heaps, but less efficient than either pairing heaps or array-based heaps.[7]
The amortized performance of a Fibonacci heap depends on the degree (number of children) of any tree root being O(log n), where n is the size of the heap.Here we show that the size of the (sub)tree rooted at any node x of degree d in the heap must have size at least Fd+2, where Fk is the kth Fibonacci number.The degree bound follows from this and the fact (easily proved by induction) that Fd+2≥φd{\displaystyle F_{d+2}\geq \varphi ^{d}} for all integers d≥0{\displaystyle d\geq 0}, where φ=(1+5)/2≐1.618{\displaystyle \varphi =(1+{\sqrt {5}})/2\doteq 1.618}.(We then have n≥Fd+2≥φd{\displaystyle n\geq F_{d+2}\geq \varphi ^{d}}, and taking the log to base φ{\displaystyle \varphi } of both sides gives d≤logφ⁡n{\displaystyle d\leq \log _{\varphi }n} as required.)

Extraction: Remove the root and insert the last element of the heap in the root. If this will violate the heap property, sift down the new root (sink operation) to reestablish the heap property.
The Java platform (since version 1.5) provides a binary heap implementation with the class java.util.PriorityQueue in the Java Collections Framework. This class implements by default a min-heap; to implement a max-heap, programmer should write a custom comparator. There is no support for the replace, sift-up/sift-down, or decrease/increase-key operations.

Construction of a binary (or d-ary) heap out of a given array of elements may be performed in linear time using the classic Floyd algorithm, with the worst-case number of comparisons equal to 2N − 2s2(N) − e2(N) (for a binary heap), where s2(N) is the sum of all digits of the binary representation of N and e2(N) is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of N.[7] This is faster than a sequence of consecutive insertions into an originally empty heap, which is log-linear.[a]

The standard library of the D programming language includes std.container.BinaryHeap, which is implemented in terms of D's ranges. Instances can be constructed from any random-access range. BinaryHeap exposes an input range interface that allows iteration with D's built-in foreach statements and integration with the range-based API of the std.algorithm package.
Each insertion takes O(log(k)) in the existing size of the heap, thus ∑k=1nO(log⁡k){\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}O(\log k)}. Since log⁡n/2=(log⁡n)−1{\displaystyle \log n/2=(\log n)-1}, a constant factor (half) of these insertions are within a constant factor of the maximum, so asymptotically we can assume k=n{\displaystyle k=n}; formally the time is nO(log⁡n)−O(n)=O(nlog⁡n){\displaystyle nO(\log n)-O(n)=O(n\log n)}. This can also be readily seen from Stirling's approximation.

Heapsort: One of the best sorting methods being in-place and with no quadratic worst-case scenarios.
Note that, as shown in the graphic, there is no implied ordering between siblings or cousins and no implied sequence for an in-order traversal (as there would be in, e.g., a binary search tree). The heap relation mentioned above applies only between nodes and their parents, grandparents, etc. The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap.

Each element in the array represents a node of the heap, and
Although different type of heaps implement the operations differently, the most common way is as follows:
Insertion: Add the new element at the end of the heap, in the first available free space. If this will violate the heap property, sift up the new element (swim operation) until the heap property has been reestablished.
Graph algorithms: By using heaps as internal traversal data structures, run time will be reduced by polynomial order. Examples of such problems are Prim's minimal-spanning-tree algorithm and Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm.
The C++ Standard Library provides the .mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}make_heap, push_heap and pop_heap algorithms for heaps (usually implemented as binary heaps), which operate on arbitrary random access iterators. It treats the iterators as a reference to an array, and uses the array-to-heap conversion. It also provides the container adaptor priority_queue, which wraps these facilities in a container-like class. However, there is no standard support for the replace, sift-up/sift-down, or decrease/increase-key operations.

For a binary heap, in the array, the first index contains the root element. The next two indices of the array contain the root's children. The next four indices contain the four children of the root's two child nodes, and so on. Therefore, given a node at index i, its children are at indices 2i+1{\displaystyle 2i+1} and 2i+2{\displaystyle 2i+2}, and its parent is at index ⌊(i−1)/2⌋. This simple indexing scheme makes it efficient to move "up" or "down" the tree.

In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete[1] tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.[2] The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.

Pharo has an implementation of a heap in the Collections-Sequenceable package along with a set of test cases. A heap is used in the implementation of the timer event loop.
Balancing a heap is done by sift-up or sift-down operations (swapping elements which are out of order). As we can build a heap from an array without requiring extra memory (for the nodes, for example), heapsort can be used to sort an array in-place.

Replacement: Remove the root and put the new element in the root and sift down. When compared to extraction followed by insertion, this avoids a sift up step.
After an element is inserted into or deleted from a heap, the heap property may be violated, and the heap must be re-balanced by swapping elements within the array.
sift-up: move a node up in the tree, as long as needed; used to restore heap condition after insertion. Called "sift" because node moves up the tree until it reaches the correct level, as in a sieve.

K-way merge: A heap data structure is useful to merge many already-sorted input streams into a single sorted output stream. Examples of the need for merging include external sorting and streaming results from distributed data such as a log structured merge tree. The inner loop is obtaining the min element, replacing with the next element for the corresponding input stream, then doing a sift-down heap operation. (Alternatively the replace function.) (Using extract-max and insert functions of a priority queue are much less efficient.)
A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a binary tree (see figure). The heap data structure, specifically the binary heap, was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964, as a data structure for the heapsort sorting algorithm.[3] Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has a smallest possible height—a heap with N nodes and a branches for each node always has loga N height.

The heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as "heaps", regardless of how they may be implemented. In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. However, a heap is not a sorted structure; it can be regarded as being partially ordered. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority, or when insertions need to be interspersed with removals of the root node.

Since the longest possible path without a cycle can be |V|−1{\displaystyle |V|-1} edges, the edges must be scanned |V|−1{\displaystyle |V|-1} times to ensure the shortest path has been found for all nodes. A final scan of all the edges is performed and if any distance is updated, then a path of length |V|{\displaystyle |V|} edges has been found which can only occur if at least one negative cycle exists in the graph.

if there is a path from s to u with at most i edges, then Distance(u) is at most the length of the shortest path from s to u with at most i edges.
The main disadvantages of the Bellman–Ford algorithm in this setting are as follows:
The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.[1]It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.The algorithm was first proposed by Alfonso Shimbel (1955), but is instead named after Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr., who published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively.[2] Edward F. Moore also published a variation of the algorithm in 1959, and for this reason it is also sometimes called the Bellman–Ford–Moore algorithm.[1]
For the second part, consider a shortest path P (there may be more than one) from source to v with at most i edges. Let u be the last vertex before v on this path. Then, the part of the path from source to u is a shortest path from source to u with at most i-1 edges, since if it were not, then there must be some strictly shorter path from source to u with at most i-1 edges, and we could then append the edge uv to this path to obtain a path with at most i edges that is strictly shorter than P—a contradiction. By inductive assumption, u.distance after i−1 iterations is at most the length of this path from source to u. Therefore, uv.weight + u.distance is at most the length of P. In the ith iteration, v.distance gets compared with uv.weight + u.distance, and is set equal to it if uv.weight + u.distance is smaller. Therefore, after i iterations, v.distance is at most the length of P, i.e., the length of the shortest path from source to v that uses at most i edges.
For the inductive case, we first prove the first part. Consider a moment when a vertex's distance is updated byv.distance := u.distance + uv.weight. By inductive assumption, u.distance is the length of some path from source to u. Then u.distance + uv.weight is the length of the path from source to v that follows the path fromsource to u and then goes to v.

Bellman–Ford runs in O(|V|⋅|E|){\displaystyle O(|V|\cdot |E|)} time, where |V|{\displaystyle |V|} and |E|{\displaystyle |E|} are the number of vertices and edges respectively.
A distributed variant of the Bellman–Ford algorithm is used in distance-vector routing protocols, for example the Routing Information Protocol (RIP). The algorithm is distributed because it involves a number of nodes (routers) within an Autonomous system (AS), a collection of IP networks typically owned by an ISP.It consists of the following steps:
Another improvement, by Bannister & Eppstein (2012), replaces the arbitrary linear order of the vertices used in Yen's second improvement by a random permutation. This change makes the worst case for Yen's improvement (in which the edges of a shortest path strictly alternate between the two subsets Ef and Eb) very unlikely to happen. With a randomly permuted vertex ordering, the expected number of iterations needed in the main loop is at most |V|/3{\displaystyle |V|/3}.[6]

Like Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman–Ford proceeds by relaxation, in which approximations to the correct distance are replaced by better ones until they eventually reach the solution. In both algorithms, the approximate distance to each vertex is always an overestimate of the true distance, and is replaced by the minimum of its old value and the length of a newly found path.However, Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to greedily select the closest vertex that has not yet been processed, and performs this relaxation process on all of its outgoing edges; by contrast, the Bellman–Ford algorithm simply relaxes all the edges, and does this |V|−1{\displaystyle |V|-1} times, where |V|{\displaystyle |V|} is the number of vertices in the graph. In each of these repetitions, the number of vertices with correctly calculated distances grows, from which it follows that eventually all vertices will have their correct distances. This method allows the Bellman–Ford algorithm to be applied to a wider class of inputs than Dijkstra. The intermediate answers depend on the order of edges relaxed, but the final answer remains the same.
Count to infinity if link or node failures render a node unreachable from some set of other nodes, those nodes may spend forever gradually increasing their estimates of the distance to it, and in the meantime there may be routing loops.

The Bellman–Ford algorithm may be improved in practice (although not in the worst case) by the observation that, if an iteration of the main loop of the algorithm terminates without making any changes, the algorithm can be immediately terminated, as subsequent iterations will not make any more changes. With this early termination condition, the main loop may in some cases use many fewer than |V| − 1 iterations, even though the worst case of the algorithm remains unchanged. The following improvements all maintain the O(|V|⋅|E|){\displaystyle O(|V|\cdot |E|)} worst-case time complexity.
If there are no negative-weight cycles, then every shortest path visits each vertex at most once, so at step 3 no further improvements can be made. Conversely, suppose no improvement can be made. Then for any cycle with vertices v[0], ..., v[k−1],
When the algorithm is used to find shortest paths, the existence of negative cycles is a problem, preventing the algorithm from finding a correct answer. However, since it terminates upon finding a negative cycle, the Bellman–Ford algorithm can be used for applications in which this is the target to be sought – for example in cycle-cancelling techniques in network flow analysis.[1]

Negative edge weights are found in various applications of graphs, hence the usefulness of this algorithm.[3]If a graph contains a "negative cycle" (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) that is reachable from the source, then there is no cheapest path: any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative cycle. In such a case, the Bellman–Ford algorithm can detect and report the negative cycle.[1][4]

Proof. For the base case of induction, consider i=0 and the moment before for loop is executed for the first time. Then, for the source vertex, source.distance = 0, which is correct. For other vertices u, u.distance = infinity, which is also correct because there is no path from source to u with 0 edges.

When a node receives distance tables from its neighbors, it calculates the shortest routes to all other nodes and updates its own table to reflect any changes.
The core of the algorithm is a loop that scans across all edges at every loop. For every i≤|V|−1{\displaystyle i\leq |V|-1}, at the end of the i{\displaystyle i}-th iteration, from any vertex v, following the predecessor trail recorded in predecessor yields a path that has a total weight that is at most distance[v], and further, distance[v] is a lower bound to the length of any path from source to v that usesat most i edges.
The correctness of the algorithm can be shown by induction:
A variation of the Bellman–Ford algorithm known as Shortest Path Faster Algorithm, first described by Moore (1959), reduces the number of relaxation steps that need to be performed within each iteration of the algorithm. If a vertex v has a distance value that has not changed since the last time the edges out of v were relaxed, then there is no need to relax the edges out of v a second time. In this way, as the number of vertices with correct distance values grows, the number whose outgoing edges that need to be relaxed in each iteration shrinks, leading to a constant-factor savings in time for dense graphs.

As discussed above, every node needs to find its minimum weight outgoing incident edge after the receipt of a broadcast message from the core. If node n{\displaystyle n} receives a broadcast, it will pick its minimum weight basic edge and send a message to the node n′{\displaystyle n'} on the other side with its fragment's ID and level. Then, node n′{\displaystyle n'} will decide whether the edge is an outgoing edge and send back a message to notify node n{\displaystyle n} of the result. The decision is made according to the following:
Given a fragment of an MST T{\displaystyle T}, let e{\displaystyle e} be a minimum-weight outgoing edge of the fragment. Then joining e{\displaystyle e} and its adjacent non-fragment node to the fragment yields another fragment of an MST.
Merge: This operation occurs if both F{\displaystyle F} and F′{\displaystyle F'} share a common minimum weight outgoing edge, and Level(F)=Level(F′){\displaystyle {\mathit {Level}}(F)={\mathit {Level}}(F')}. The level of the combined fragment will be Level(F)+1{\displaystyle {\mathit {Level}}(F)+1}.
FragmentID(n)=FragmentID(n′){\displaystyle {\mathit {Fragment}}_{\mathit {ID}}(n)={\mathit {Fragment}}_{\mathit {ID}}(n')}. That is, nodes n{\displaystyle n} and n′{\displaystyle n'} belong to same fragment, so the edge is not outgoing.
Both Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm require processes to know the state of the whole graph, which is very difficult to discover in the message-passing model.
As the output of the algorithm, every node knows which of its links belong to the minimum spanning tree and which do not.
Basic edges are all edges that are neither branch edges nor rejected edges.
After the completion of the previous stage, the two nodes connected by the core can inform each other of the best edges they received. Then they can identify the minimum outgoing edge from the entire fragment. A message will be sent from the core to the minimum outgoing edge via a path of branch edges. Finally, a message will be sent out via the chosen outgoing edge to request to combine the two fragments that the edge connects. Depending on the levels of those two fragments, one of two combined operations are performed to form a new fragment; details discussed below.
The input graph G(V,E){\displaystyle G(V,E)} is considered to be a network, where vertices V{\displaystyle V} are independent computing nodes and edges E{\displaystyle E} are communication links. Links are weighted as in the classical problem.
Choose its minimum-weight incident edge and mark that edge as a branch edge.
Let F{\displaystyle F} and F′{\displaystyle F'} be the two fragments that need to be combined. There are two ways to do this:[1][6]

Define a fragment of an MST T{\displaystyle T} to be a sub-tree of T{\displaystyle T}. That is, a fragment is a connected set of nodes and edges of T{\displaystyle T}. MSTs have two important properties in relation to fragments:[1]
Node n′{\displaystyle n'} has already sent a convergecast message back to the core. Before node n′{\displaystyle n'} sent a convergecast message, it must have picked a minimum weight outgoing edge. As we discussed above, n′{\displaystyle n'} does that by choosing its minimum weight basic edge, sending a test message to the other side of the chosen edge, and waiting for the response. Suppose e′{\displaystyle e'} is the chosen edge, we can conclude the following:e′≠e{\displaystyle e'\neq e}weight(e′)<weight(e){\displaystyle {\mathit {weight}}(e')<{\mathit {weight}}(e)}The second statement follows if the first one holds. For the first statement, suppose n′{\displaystyle n'} chose the edge e{\displaystyle e} and sent a test message to n{\displaystyle n} via edge e{\displaystyle e}. Then, node n{\displaystyle n} will delay the response (according to case 3 of "Finding the minimum weight incident outgoing edge"). Then, it is impossible that n′{\displaystyle n'} has already sent its convergecast message. By the aforementioned conclusions 1 and 2, we can conclude it is safe to absorb F{\displaystyle F} into F′{\displaystyle F'} since e′{\displaystyle e'} is still the minimum outgoing edge to report after F{\displaystyle F} is absorbed.
The two nodes adjacent to the core broadcast messages to the rest of the nodes in the fragment. The messages are sent via the branch edge but not via the core. Each broadcast message contains the ID and level of the fragment. At the end of this stage, each node has received the new fragment ID and level.
In non-zero-level fragments, a separate algorithm is executed in each level. This algorithm can be separated into three stages: broadcast, convergecast, and change core.
The distributed minimum spanning tree (MST) problem involves the construction of a minimum spanning tree by a distributed algorithm, in a network where nodes communicate by message passing. It is radically different from the classical sequential problem, although the most basic approach resembles Borůvka's algorithm. One important application of this problem is to find a tree that can be used for broadcasting. In particular, if the cost for a message to pass through an edge in a graph is significant, an MST can minimize the total cost for a source process to communicate with all the other processes in the network.
Initially, each node is in an inactive state. Each note either spontaneously awakens or is awakened by receipt of any message from another node.
These two properties form the basis for proving correctness of the GHS algorithm. In general, the GHS algorithm is a bottom-up algorithm in the sense that it starts by letting each individual node be a fragment, and then joining fragments until a single fragment is left. The above properties imply that the remaining fragment must be an MST.

The problem was first suggested and solved in O(Vlog⁡V){\displaystyle O(V\log V)} time in 1983 by Gallager et al.,[1] where V{\displaystyle V} is the number of vertices in the graph. Later, the solution was improved to O(V){\displaystyle O(V)}[2] and finally[3][4]O(Vlog∗⁡V+D){\displaystyle O({\sqrt {V}}\log ^{*}V+D)} where D is the network, or graph diameter. A lower bound on the time complexity of the solution has been eventually shown to be[5]Ω(Vlog⁡V+D).{\displaystyle \Omega \left({{\frac {\sqrt {V}}{\log V}}+D}\right).}

The message-passing model is one of the most commonly used models in distributed computing. In this model, each process is modeled as a node of a graph. Each communication channel between two processes is an edge of the graph.
Both Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm require processing one node or vertex at a time, making it difficult to make them run in parallel. For example, Kruskal's algorithm processes edges in turn, deciding whether to include the edge in the MST based on whether it would form a cycle with all previously chosen edges.
The GHS algorithm[1] of Gallager, Humblet and Spira is one of the best-known algorithms in distributed computing theory. This algorithm constructs an MST in the asynchronous message-passing model.
Furthermore, when an "Absorb" operation occurs, F{\displaystyle F} must be in the stage of changing the core, while F′{\displaystyle F'} can be in an arbitrary stage. Therefore, "Absorb" operations may be done differently depending on the state of F′{\displaystyle F'}. Let e{\displaystyle e} be the edge that F{\displaystyle F} and F′{\displaystyle F'} want to combine with, and let n{\displaystyle n} and n′{\displaystyle n'} be the two nodes connected by e{\displaystyle e} in F{\displaystyle F} and F′{\displaystyle F'}, respectively. There are two cases to consider:
Wait for a message from the other end of the edge.
FragmentID(n)≠FragmentID(n′){\displaystyle {\mathit {Fragment}}_{\mathit {ID}}(n)\neq {\mathit {Fragment}}_{\mathit {ID}}(n')} and Level(n)≤Level(n′){\displaystyle {\mathit {Level}}(n)\leq {\mathit {Level}}(n')}. That is, nodes n{\displaystyle n} and n′{\displaystyle n'} belong to the different fragments, so the edge is outgoing.
Node n′{\displaystyle n'} has received broadcast message but it has not sent a convergecast message back to the core. In this case, fragment F{\displaystyle F} can simply join the broadcast process of F′{\displaystyle F'}. Specifically, we image F{\displaystyle F} and F′{\displaystyle F'} have already combined to form a new fragment F″{\displaystyle F''}, so we want to find the minimum weight outgoing edge of F″{\displaystyle F''}. In order to do that, node n′{\displaystyle n'} can initiate a broadcast to F{\displaystyle F} to update the fragment ID of each node in F{\displaystyle F} and collect minimum weight outgoing edge in F{\displaystyle F}.
Shay Kutten and David Peleg, “Fast Distributed Construction of Smallk-Dominating Sets and Applications,” Journal of Algorithms, Volume 28, Issue 1, July 1998, Pages 40-66.
In level-0 fragments, each awakened node will do the following:
The edge that is chosen by the two nodes it connects becomes the core edge, and is assigned level 1.
FragmentID(n)≠FragmentID(n′){\displaystyle {\mathit {Fragment}}_{\mathit {ID}}(n)\neq {\mathit {Fragment}}_{\mathit {ID}}(n')} and Level(n)>Level(n′){\displaystyle {\mathit {Level}}(n)>{\mathit {Level}}(n')}. We cannot make any conclusion. The reason is that the two nodes may belong to the same fragment already, but node n′{\displaystyle n'} has not discovered this fact yet due to the delay of a broadcast message. In this case, the algorithm lets node n′{\displaystyle n'} postpone the response until its level becomes higher than or equal to the level it received from node n{\displaystyle n}.
At the beginning of the algorithm, nodes know only the weights of the links which are connected to them. (It is possible to consider models in which they know more, for example their neighbors' links.)
Rejected edges are those that have been determined not to be part of the MST.
The GHS algorithm has a nice property that the lowest level fragments will not be blocked, although some operations in the non-lowest level fragments may be blocked. This property implies the algorithm will eventually terminate with a minimum spanning tree.

As mentioned above, fragments are combined by either "Merge" or "Absorb" operation. The "Absorb" operation does not change the maximum level among all fragments. The "Merge" operation may increase the maximum level by 1. In the worst case, all fragments are combined with "Merge" operations, so the number of fragments decreases by half in each level. Therefore, the maximum number of levels is O(log⁡V){\displaystyle O(\log V)}, where V{\displaystyle V} is the number of nodes.
Due to these difficulties, new techniques were needed for distributed MST algorithms in the message-passing model. Some bear similarities to Borůvka's algorithm for the classical MST problem.

The GHS algorithm assigns a level to each fragment, which is a non-decreasing integer with initial value 0. Furthermore, each fragment with a non-zero level has an ID, which is the ID of the core edge in the fragment, which is selected when the fragment is constructed. During the execution of the algorithm, each node can classify each of its incident edges into three categories:[1][6]

Since DOI is a namespace within the Handle System, it is semantically correct to represent it as the URI info:doi/10.1000/182.
A DOI aims to resolve to its target, the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL where the object is located. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from ISBNs or ISRCs which are identifiers only. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model for representing metadata.

A digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify various objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).[1] DOIs are an implementation of the Handle System;[2][3] they also fit within the URI system (Uniform Resource Identifier). They are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications. DOIs have also been used to identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.

The CrossRef recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyperlinked to its appropriate URL – the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.[20]
Registration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a not-for-profit cost recovery basis.
A DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.[29]

Contrary to the DOI Handbook, CrossRef, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, https://doi.org/10.1000/182) instead of the officially specified format (for example, doi:10.1000/182)[17][18] This URL is persistent (there is a contract that ensures persistence in the DOI.ORG domain), so it is a PURL – providing the location of an HTTP proxy server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item.[9][19]

The DOI syntax is a NISO standard, first standardised in 2000, ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2005 Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier.[41]
A DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a Uniform Resource Name (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.

URN architecture assumes a DNS-based Resolution Discovery Service (RDS) to find the service appropriate to the given URN scheme. However no such widely deployed RDS schemes currently exist.... DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System. It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string urn:doi:10.1000/1 rather than the simpler doi:10.1000/1) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution. If RDS mechanisms supporting URN specifications become widely available, DOI will be registered as a URN.

Other DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include the Handle System and PANGAEA. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a non-paywalled (often author archived) version of a title and redirects the user to that instead of the publisher's version.[31][32] Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016[33] (later Unpaywall). While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).[31][33]
The DOI system offers persistent, semantically interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as "identifiers" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other "identifier systems" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).

Registration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level 10 prefix.[36]

DOI name resolution is provided through the Handle System, developed by Corporation for National Research Initiatives, and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its  field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.

The IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of persistent identification, in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated (although when the publisher of a journal changes, sometimes all the DOIs will be changed, with the old DOIs no longer working). It also associates metadata with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure.
Another approach, which avoids typing or cutting-and-pasting into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as https://doi.org/ (preferred)[30] or http://dx.doi.org/, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI 10.1000/182 can be included in a reference or hyperlink as https://doi.org/10.1000/182. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.

The Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the URI specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on open architectures, incorporates trust mechanisms, and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.[25] DOI name-resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.[26] However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents, that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.[27]

For example, in the DOI name 10.1000/182, the prefix is 10.1000 and the suffix is 182. The "10" part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,[A] and the characters 1000 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. 182 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the DOI Handbook).

The developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000.[8] Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs.[9] The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF.[10] By late April 2011 more than 50 million DOI names had been assigned by some 4,000 organizations,[11] and by April 2013 this number had grown to 85 million DOI names assigned through 9,500 organizations.
The DOI system is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.[37] The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation – Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval. The relevant ISO Working Group later submitted an edited version to ISO for distribution as an FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot,[38] which was approved by 100% of those voting in a ballot closing on 15 November 2010.[39] The final standard was published on 23 April 2012.[1]

The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI should provide a more stable link than directly using its URL. But if its URL changes, the publisher must update the metadata for the DOI to maintain the link to the URL.[4][5][6] It is the publisher's responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link, leaving the DOI useless.[7]
The prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is at least a four digit number greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants.[12][13] The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.[14]

The indecs Content Model as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects.

Iterative deepening A* is a best-first search that performs iterative deepening based on "f"-values similar to the ones computed in the A* algorithm.

For this graph, as more depth is added, the two cycles "ABFE" and "AEFB" will simply get longer before the algorithm gives up and tries another branch.
Iterative deepening prevents this loop and will reach the following nodes on the following depths, assuming it proceeds left-to-right as above:
The space complexity of IDDFS is O(d){\displaystyle O(d)},[1]: 5  where d{\displaystyle d} is the depth of the goal.
The higher the branching factor, the lower the overhead of repeatedly expanded states,[1]: 6  but even when the branching factor is 2, iterative deepening search only takes about twice as long as a complete breadth-first search. This means that the time complexity of iterative deepening is still O(bd){\displaystyle O(b^{d})}.
where bd{\displaystyle b^{d}} is the number of expansions at depth d{\displaystyle d}, 2bd−1{\displaystyle 2b^{d-1}} is the number of expansions at depth d−1{\displaystyle d-1}, and so on. Factoring out bd{\displaystyle b^{d}} gives
The main advantage of IDDFS in game tree searching is that the earlier searches tend to improve the commonly used heuristics, such as the killer heuristic and alpha–beta pruning, so that a more accurate estimate of the score of various nodes at the final depth search can occur, and the search completes more quickly since it is done in a better order. For example, alpha–beta pruning is most efficient if it searches the best moves first.[4]

Additional difficulty of applying bidirectional IDDFS is that if the source and the target nodes are in different strongly connected components, say, s∈S,t∈T{\displaystyle s\in S,t\in T}, if there is no arc leaving S{\displaystyle S} and entering T{\displaystyle T}, the search will never terminate.
Since (1−x)−2{\displaystyle (1-x)^{-2}} or (1−1b)−2{\displaystyle \left(1-{\frac {1}{b}}\right)^{-2}} is a constant independent of d{\displaystyle d} (the depth), if b>1{\displaystyle b>1} (i.e., if the branching factor is greater than 1), the running time of the depth-first iterative deepening search is O(bd){\displaystyle O(b^{d})}.
2-tuples are useful as return value to signal IDDFS to continue deepening or stop, in case tree depth and goal membership are unknown a priori. Another solution could use sentinel values instead to represent not found or remaining level results.

A second advantage is the responsiveness of the algorithm. Because early iterations use small values for d{\displaystyle d}, they execute extremely quickly. This allows the algorithm to supply early indications of the result almost immediately, followed by refinements as d{\displaystyle d} increases. When used in an interactive setting, such as in a chess-playing program, this facility allows the program to play at any time with the current best move found in the search it has completed so far. This can be phrased as each depth of the search corecursively producing a better approximation of the solution, though the work done at each step is recursive. This is not possible with a traditional depth-first search, which does not produce intermediate results.

In general, iterative deepening is the preferred search method when there is a large search space and the depth of the solution is not known.[4]
The time complexity of IDDFS in a (well-balanced) tree works out to be the same as breadth-first search, i.e. O(bd){\displaystyle O(b^{d})},[1]: 5  where b{\displaystyle b} is the branching factor and d{\displaystyle d} is the depth of the goal.
IDDFS combines depth-first search's space-efficiency and breadth-first search's completeness (when the branching factor is finite). If a solution exists, it will find a solution path with the fewest arcs.[3]

where n{\displaystyle n} is the number of nodes in the shortest s,t{\displaystyle s,t}-path. Since the running time complexity of iterative deepening depth-first search is ∑k=0nbk{\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{n}b^{k}}, the speedup is roughly

If the goal node is found, then DLS unwinds the recursion returning with no further iterations. Otherwise, if at least one node exists at that level of depth, the remaining flag will let IDDFS continue.
One limitation of the algorithm is that the shortest path consisting of an odd number of arcs will not be detected. Suppose we have a shortest path ⟨s,u,v,t⟩.{\displaystyle \langle s,u,v,t\rangle .} When the depth will reach two hops along the arcs, the forward search will proceed to v{\displaystyle v} from u{\displaystyle u}, and the backward search will proceed from v{\displaystyle v} to u{\displaystyle u}. Pictorially, the search frontiers will go through each other, and instead a suboptimal path consisting of an even number of arcs will be returned. This is illustrated in the below diagrams:
∑k=0nbk2∑k=0n/2bk=1−bn+11−b21−bn/2+11−b=1−bn+12(1−bn/2+1)=bn+1−12(bn/2+1−1)≈bn+12bn/2+1=Θ(bn/2).{\displaystyle {\frac {\sum _{k=0}^{n}b^{k}}{2\sum _{k=0}^{n/2}b^{k}}}={\frac {\frac {1-b^{n+1}}{1-b}}{2{\frac {1-b^{n/2+1}}{1-b}}}}={\frac {1-b^{n+1}}{2(1-b^{n/2+1})}}={\frac {b^{n+1}-1}{2(b^{n/2+1}-1)}}\approx {\frac {b^{n+1}}{2b^{n/2+1}}}=\Theta (b^{n/2}).}
What comes to space complexity, the algorithm colors the deepest nodes in the forward search process in order to detect existence of the middle node where the two search processes meet.

All together, an iterative deepening search from depth 1{\displaystyle 1} all the way down to depth d{\displaystyle d} expands only about 11%{\displaystyle 11\%} more nodes than a single breadth-first or depth-limited search to depth d{\displaystyle d}, when b=10{\displaystyle b=10}.[5]
Since IDDFS, at any point, is engaged in a depth-first search, it need only store a stack of nodes which represents the branch of the tree it is expanding. Since it finds a solution of optimal length, the maximum depth of this stack is d{\displaystyle d}, and hence the maximum amount of space is O(d){\displaystyle O(d)}.
Similar to iterative deepening is a search strategy called iterative lengthening search that works with increasing path-cost limits instead of depth-limits. It expands nodes in the order of increasing path cost; therefore the first goal it encounters is the one with the cheapest path cost. But iterative lengthening incurs substantial overhead that makes it less useful than iterative deepening.[4]
