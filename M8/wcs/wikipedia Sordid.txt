Sordid, Wormlick, and Bisk appeared in Spendrugle shortly after the Suncurl wrecked on a reef offshore, shocking former allies and fellow plotters Heck Urse and Gust Hubb.Sordid revealed that as their dory sank the three were able to shuck their armor and return to the surface.But by then it was too late, and they watched the Suncurl sail away.Determined to regain their share of the loot, they followed the Suncurl's trail to Spendrugle.[3]All five of the ex-garrison soldiers fought their way into Wurms Keep past the reanimated corpses of two of the Suncurl's three Brivs.[4] Once inside, they confronted the necromancers Bauchelain and Korbal Broach demanding the return of their money.But Bauchelain informed them that the gold and silver had gone down with the ship.Unphased by the necromancer, Sordid engaged Bauchelain in flirtatious banter.[5]The soldiers later returned to town with plans to salvage their treasure from the wreckage of their former vessel.[6]

Barnes' unique vocal style and unusual phrasing was the trademark of Sordid Humor, and he went on to lend his vocals and alt-rock guitar style to Engine 88, and a solo project called the Blimp. Sordid Humor played a textured rock with layers of guitars and vocals that, at the time, could best be classified as college rock, releasing several independent releases before breaking up in 1992.
Sordid Humor was an American rock music band, formed in 1987 by the duo of Tom Barnes and Jim Gordon. The duo received help from drummers Ken Gregg, Chris Pedersen, and Toby Hawkins, and bassists Tony Fader, David Immergluck and Marty Jones.[1] [2]
Marty Jones also played bass on "Light Music".He is the namesake for the Counting Crows song "Mr. Jones".

An EP entitled Tony Don't was released on vinyl in 1989 by Oedpius Records of San Francisco, CA.

Despite their limited success, Sordid Humor's music has survived in the choices of college DJs. They are notable for bringing together three musicians of Counting Crows: Adam Duritz, who sang backing vocals on "Barbarossa" and several other tracks on Light Music, David Immerglück, who played bass on several tracks of the album, and David Bryson who produced several of their tracks. Duritz would later incorporate lyrics from Sordid Humor songs"Private Archipelago", "Doris Day", and "Jumping Jesus" in Counting Crows performances, and Counting Crows would include a cover of "Jumping Jesus" on their album Underwater Sunshine.

1Architecture of the domestic warren											Toggle Architecture of the domestic warren subsection																					1.1Moat and pale																											1.2Pillow mounds
To keep the rabbits from escaping, domestic warrens were usually provided with a fairly substantive moat, or ditch filled with water.Rabbits generally do not swim and avoid water. A pale, or fence, was provided to exclude predators.
^ English Garth "small, enclosed plot" is from Old Norse garðr "yard, courtyard, fence".
The use is further extended to any system of burrows, e.g., "prairie dog warren".By 1649, the term was applied to inferior, crowded human accommodations and meant "cluster of densely populated living spaces" (OED).Contemporarily, the leading use seems to be in the stock phrase "warren of cubicles" in the workplace.[original research?]
Ultimately, the term "warren" was generalized to include wild burrows. According to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica:
English Garth "small, enclosed plot" is from Old Norse garðr "yard, courtyard, fence".

A warren is a network of wild rodent or lagomorph, typically rabbit burrows. Domestic warrens are artificial, enclosed establishment of animal husbandry dedicated to the raising of rabbits for meat and fur. The term evolved from the medieval Anglo-Norman concept of free warren, which had been, essentially, the equivalent of a hunting license for a given woodland.

The cunicularia of the monasteries may have more closely resembled hutches or pens, than the open enclosures with specialized structures which the domestic warren eventually became. Such an enclosure or close was called a cony-garth, or sometimes conegar, coneygree or "bury" (from "burrow").

The word thus became used of a piece of ground preserved for these beasts of warren. It is now applied loosely to any piece of ground, whether preserved or not, where rabbits breed.[4]
This type of architecture and animal husbandry has become obsolete, but numerous pillow mounds are still to be found in Britain, some of them maintained by English Heritage, with the greatest density being found on Dartmoor.[3]
The most characteristic structure of the "cony-garth" ("rabbit-yard")[1] is the pillow mound.These were "pillow-like", oblong mounds with flat tops, frequently described as being "cigar-shaped", and sometimes arranged like the letter ⟨E⟩ or into more extensive, interconnected rows.Often these were provided with pre-built, stone-lined tunnels. The preferred orientation was on a gentle slope, with the arms extending downhill, to facilitate drainage.The soil needed to be soft, to accommodate further burrowing.[2]
