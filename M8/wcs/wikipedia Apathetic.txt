La Coka Nostra was founded in 2005 as a loose collective of artists connected through Danny Boy of House of Pain. Having taken time off from rap after the break-up of House of Pain, Danny Boy took to working in video production and fashion as well as mentoring other artists.

Eventually it turned into more of a group effort including the former members of House of Pain and Ill Bill. It was announced that Everlast would be leaving La Coka Nostra due to his daughter's medical issues.[citation needed]

Having been afflicted with chronic asthma since the age of thirteen months,[14] Monch developed new and creative ways to deliver his lyrics when rapping.

There were rumors his next album, at first tentatively titled Innervisions, was to be released under Denaun Porter's new Shady Records imprint Runyon Ave. They reached out to Stevie Wonder and were at the beginning processes of recording the album[2]but apparently the deal fell through; Monch later announced a deal with Street Records Corporation, home of Wu-Tang Clan, David Banner and Terror Squad. On December 19, 2006, Pharoahe Monch released his first and only official mixtape, The Awakening, hosted by Clinton Sparks, DJ Boogie Brown.[3] In June 2007, Monch released his second solo album Desire to critical acclaim. Monch said about the album; "...it's very soulful, very gospel, a fresh, new sound for me." The album's lead single was the self-produced track "Push", with "Let's Go" as its B-side. The song's music video and single were released in late September 2006. Pharoahe Monch released a second music video entitled "When the Gun Draws" at a Brooklyn music festival in February 2007. The track was inspired by a song he did with Prince Po entitled "Stray Bullet" which was featured on the Stress: The Extinction Agenda album. A final video was made for the title track "Desire" in late 2007. It was directed by New Zealand director Andy Morton and shot on the Rock the Bells tour with full band. The video features both MeLa Machinko and Showtyme.

Monch compares writing and recording his lyrics to writing and filming a movie - in the book How to Rap he says he will 'punch-in' vocals so he can "retake some things, just like a film",[16] and he 'rewrites' lyrics, saying he will "go back as a screenwriter and rewrite scenes and leave more to the imagination."[17]

Pharoahe Monch is acclaimed for his complex rapping technique;[1] AllMusic says he has, "a reputation as one of underground hip hop's pre-eminent lyricists, crafting intricate and intelligent raps."[12] Kool Moe Dee ranks him at 26 in his best MCs of all-time list, from his book, There's a God on the Mic,[13] noting: "Pharoahe Monch is like an eloquent linguistics professor moonlighting as a rhyme serial killer terrorist, challenging the listeners' I.Q. while daring him or her to keep up."[13]
In 2011, Pharoahe Monch was a judge on the Ultimate MC TV show alongside Royce da 5'9", Sean Price, Planet Asia, and Organik.[6]

Pharoahe Monch then signed to Rawkus Records, an indie label. After making several guest appearances on albums like the best-selling Rawkus compilation Soundbombing II, Monch's much-hyped debut, Internal Affairs was released in 1999. The first single of the album, "Simon Says", became a hit single, peaking at No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite its success, the song caused controversy when Monch was later sued for its unauthorized use of a sample from Akira Ifukube's Gojira Tai Mosura, the theme song to the 1992 film Godzilla vs. Mothra. This resulted in a halting in his album's distribution.

Monch released three albums as part of the rap duo Organized Konfusion with partner Prince Poetry: The self-titled Organized Konfusion, Stress: The Extinction Agenda and The Equinox. The duo handled a large amount of production on these albums themselves. All albums received positive critical reviews, but moderate sales. As a result, the duo split up after recording their final album The Equinox in 1997. Prince Poetry has since denied the possibility of an Organized Konfusion reunion.[citation needed]
For his biggest hit, "Simon Says", he comments that he wrote the choruses before he wrote the verses,[18] and fellow rapper and collaborator O.C. notes that Monch will write single lines down and then use them five years later.[19] His vocal delivery is inspired by Jazz music and musicians such as John Coltrane.[20]

On October 4, 2013, Apathy announced that "Every AOTP album we've done in the past, we all handed in our verses via email and weren't too hands-on with it. This one is different. Every day we've been emailing each other, going over songs, picking beats and showing each other our verses. This might be the best AOTP album yet. It definitely is the illest, lyrically. We're all having brotherly competition and trying to murder each other on these songs. It's great."[23]

Vinnie Paz announced on his Facebook page in early 2011 that In Death Reborn was due for release in 2012; however, the date was pushed back.[19] Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Although rumors circulated on Facebook that Reef the Lost Cauze would not appear on the album, he tweeted on November 27, 2013 that these rumors were false and he would be making an appearance on the album.[19][20] On April 12, 2013, a post on the AOTP Facebook page read: "New album is not finished. Don't know when it will be finished. Will let you know when there's a release date. No need for further questions." This caused frustration amongst fans as they had been waiting for the album for over a year.[21] On June 27, 2013, AOTP frontman Vinnie Paz confirmed via Twitter that he is working on a new solo EP as well as a new Heavy Metal Kings and AOTP album. All of which is coming within the next year.[22]

Omar Burgess of HipHopDX rated the album 3.5/5, saying that it had sufficient experimentation and raw talent to entice in casual listeners whilst still providing to its loyal fan base. According to Burgess, "Hardcore material representative of Hip Hop made in the mid-to-late '90s has been taking a beating in some circles." He critiqued the groups use of phrases like Rappity-Rap and Boom-Bap and how it epitomizes aggressive rap, infused with similes and metaphors stressed with sample-based production." Army of the Pharaoh's individual and collective careers originated from that era and the group rarely give off the impression of being threatened by this stigma.[17] He went on to say that 16 years later, AOTP divides their time between concurrently conserving Hip Hop's Golden Era and affirming their current importance by competitively out-rhyming each other despite various lineup changes and over a decade of seeing rap change.[52]

The album was noted for its different beats, due to the number of producers. Frank Grimes produced the album's second single, "Curse of the Pharaohs", and its final song: "Sumerians".British producer Leaf Dog, former DJ of The Three Amigos, made his debut on the American hip-hop scene by producing the album's third single: "The Demon's Blade".[47] Panik, one-fourth of the hip hop production team Molemen, collaborated for the first time with Army of the Pharaohs on "Ninkyo Dantai (Yakuza)".[48] Other producers included Paul Nice, Juan Muteniac and Lecs Beats, none of whom who had previously collaborated with Army of the Pharaohs.[49]

RapReviews' Grant Jones gave the album a score of 5.5/10, with a music vibe of 5/10 and a lyrical vibe of 6/10: Jones described his review as "harsh" but felt that this album summarises what Army of the Pharaohs has become, whilst still crediting the group as underground's most prominent supergroup and a modern example of underground hip hop. Even though the group has declared authenticity in their previous and individual albums, Jones described In Death Reborn as one that feels the "most manufactured" compared to all their releases. He added that the "production is provided by different producers on each song, and the vocals lack any real cohesion, almost as if each one was recorded on its own, emailed and pieced together."[53]However, he embraced the groups' collaboration with Leaf Dog, whom he describes as one of the best British producers, for his work on "The Demon's Blade" as an explosive track that hits the listener after 15 minutes of "predictable, water-treading hip hop." Noting its resemblance to previous singles "Seven" and "Battle Cry" from earlier LPs. "Visual Camouflage" produced by Juan Muteniac was another noteworthy performance by Army of the Pharaohs according to RapReviews, as it appealed character and ultimately binding the rappers with a track "worth rewinding" whilst concluding that the rest of the album is decidedly average.[16]

In Death Reborn received generally positive reviews from music critics. Mark Bozzer of Exclaim! gave the album a 7/10 rating, calling it "a hard-hitting slab of jacked-up fight music that combines aggressive beats with aggressive yet intricate wordplay." He gave praise to the producers of the album including the likes of underground and, as he described, "highly slept-on" producers Stu Bangas and Vanderslice. Both of whom crafted classics in Blaq Poet's 2011 Blaq Poet Society, amongst others.[51] The mag described the group as dropping knowledge on songs that resemble a B Movie horrorfest in terms of track title and subject matters.[18]

AllMusic's David Jeffries rated In Death Reborn 4/5. He praised the album as one that immediately feels old school due to significant participation from original member Esoteric. "That unapologetic, brutal dude attitude is in full force as "Midnight Burial" barks the lyrics 'I'm out to make a million/Kinda hard to do without pussies catchin' feelings' whilst the 13th track of the album "7th Ghost"threatens 'me peeling your grill off the front of our Hummer truck' because that's what gas guzzlers were made to do." In terms of production, Jeffries reviewed lead single "God Particle" as one that is a "new kind of stomping electro hulk" by Stu Bangas, whilst rapper and producer Apathy "puts a funky, harpsichord-driven ghost dance" below "Headless Ritual". He concluded by describing the album as "the flying death ball from Phantasm, driven by the hunger for blood and focused on looking for a forehead to lodge itself into".[54][55]

The album art differs from the group's other releases; instead of a pharaoh, there is a soldier wearing a gas mask.[30] It was later said that the cover looked oddly familiar; it was drawn from the same stock photography bank as Punch's Frozen Memory mixtape cover, which was released in November 2013 and was considered to have inspired the album art.[31] On September 28, 2018, Vinnie Paz released his album The Pain Collector, which featured the single "Gas Mask".[32] Paz stated that the single was partially inspired by the album art of In Death Reborn.[33]
