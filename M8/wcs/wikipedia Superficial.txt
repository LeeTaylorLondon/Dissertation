Montag began collaborating with producer Steve Morales[24] and songwriter Cathy Dennis in 2009.[25][26][27] Morales would go on to serve as the project's executive producer alongside Montag and Pratt.[28] Though not included on the album, Morales also produced the final version of Montag's song "Body Language" (2009), released as a single months prior to the release of Superficial.[29] Dennis has four writing credits on the finished product, including "Look How I'm Doing" and "Turn Ya Head".[30] Montag recorded a track titled "Blackout" for the album that was written by Dennis and Taylor Momsen.[31] Momsen claimed that she had written the song when she was only eight, and Dennis had made changes to the lyrics before allowing Montag to record it.[31][32] Montag recorded the Morales produced "More Is More" after finding the demo to be "progressive and edgy", and enlisted Dave Audé to produce a remix of the song for use in night clubs.[33] The song features a writing credit from singer Laura Pergolizzi, better known as LP.[33] Pergolizzi has a total of six writing credits on the album, including "Twisted".[7] Montag claimed that Pergolizzi was initially hesitant to let her record "Twisted", but agreed to let Montag have the song after hearing the completed version.[7]

Though Montag had Foster's support, she was still an independent artist and funded the album with her own money.[11] The album had a reported production cost that exceeded $2 million.[12][13][14] Montag claimed that she had "gone broke" funding her music career.[15] She and Pratt were responsible for finding and purchasing the majority of the songs on the album.[16] Montag sought after writers and producers that had worked with big-name artists at the time, stating "I really just wanted that right sound, so I set the bar high. I wanted to work with people of that caliber."[7] "One More Drink" was the first song that Montag recorded for the album.[7] "Body Language" was the next song Montag recorded for the album.[17] The song featured an un-credited rap verse from Pratt, and was ultimately Montag's first song to leak during the production of Superficial.[18][19] She recorded songs such as "Higher" and "No More" during the early stages of the album's production, both of which would be released as promotional singles in 2008.[20][21] Montag recorded a version of "Fashion", a song that was co-written and also recorded by singer Lady Gaga.[22] She additionally recorded a song titled "Dramatic", which had initially been recorded by Britney Spears for her fifth studio album.[23]

The album opens with the Morales produced "Look How I'm Doing", a dance-pop song described as a "kiss-off to a former flame."[36] Montag has also claimed the track speaks on her former friendship with Lauren Conrad.[7] "Turn Ya Head" has been described as "electronic" and "urban-pop", as well as a "club anthem."[7] The song's lyrics reference Montag drawing attention to herself on a dance floor.[7] "Fanatic" is an 80's inspired mid-tempo song that speaks about being a fanatic for a lover.[7] Montag related the song's lyrics to her feelings for Pratt, stating "I always was just such a fanatic for him, and it was just to fun to be able to sing a song that was so relatable to me in my own life."[7] "Superficial" is the album's title track and fourth song, which acknowledges Montag's public image at the time with lyrics stating, "They say I'm superficial, but they really don't know me."[37] "More Is More" is a dance track that sees Montag singing about dancing at a club and flirting with men.[7] Similarly, "One More Drink" finds Montag telling a man from the club that she'll be going home with him after she has one more drink.[7]

"Blackout" was released as a promotional single on May 19.[49] While on their honeymoon, Montag and Pratt filmed a homemade music video for the song that featured Montag in a hot tub and hammock.[50] She released a second promotional extended play titled Here She Is... on August 4, 2009.[51] The release compiled a number of Montag's promotional singles that had been released to that point.[52] She next released a finished version of "Body Language" as a single on August 14.[53] The song was initially intended to be included on Superficial, but was left off the finished product due to issues with the song sampling "Situation" (1982) by Yazoo.[54] The album's title track, "Superficial", served as the album's final promotional single before its eventual release.[55] The song was released on November 23, 2009.[55] Montag and Pratt made a video for the song featuring footage from their life the past few years, releasing it in April 2010.[56] Superficial was released to digital retailers through Pratt Productions and the Warner Music Group on January 11, 2010.[57][58] The album is available in both a clean and explicit version, due to the song "More Is More".[57]

The album experienced numerous setbacks during its production, with several songs meant for the project leaking throughout the years prior to its release. Upon its release, Superficial was met with a harsh reaction from music critics. Though some praised the album's production, Montag's vocals were met with a negative reception. It sold an estimated 1,000 copies during its first week of release, failing to appear on any major music charts. Superficial has been deemed a commercial "flop" due to the lackluster commercial performance. Montag has since attributed the album's failure to a lack of promotional effort on her part as well as her lack of fame and popularity. Since its release, the album has gained somewhat of a cult following.

Throughout the recording process, Superficial underwent a number of working titles. The project was initially intended to be self-titled, while titles such as The One and Independent were also announced online.[citation needed] Montag later confirmed the album's final title as Superficial, inspired by "the world [she lives] in" and her public perception.[59] Montag revealed the album's original cover in November 2009, shot by Liz Ciganovich.[60] The photo saw the singer in a polka-dot leotard posing in front of a wall of cassette tapes.[60] The image, which drew inspiration from the music video for "Physical" (1981) by Olivia Newton-John, paid homage to the music scene of the 1980s "when you just had to run out to the record store and get your favorite album", according to Montag.[61] Prior to the album's release, Montag changed the album's cover to an image of her in a short black dress posing in front of a camera lens.[62] Ciganovich photographed the updated album cover as well.[62]

Montag first rose to fame as a cast member on the MTV television series The Hills.[1] She gained further notoriety through her relationship with co-star Spencer Pratt, with the two gaining a reputation as "villains" in the media.[2][3][4] With her career on the rise, Montag announced her intentions of recording a pop album.[5][6] She explained her venture into music, stating "I always loved to sing. I was shy about that for a while, but I eventually started to open up about how I wanted to record an album. I knew I needed to start making moves."[7] Prior to her rise to stardom, Montag's manager had begun laying down the groundwork for her to begin working on a pop-rock influenced album, though Montag insisted on a pop album.[8][9] She cited artists such as Britney Spears and Janet Jackson as her main musical influences, claiming they made her want to be a pop star.[8] Pratt, a talent manager who had managed Brody Jenner, was able to get Montag a meeting with Jenner's former step-father David Foster to speak about her potential music career.[7] Following a meeting at Foster's recording studio in Miami, he agreed to work with Montag.[7][10]

Some are more pop. Some are more ballady. Some are a little more rock. Some are a little bit edgier, but they all go together in some way."[35] Superficial featured songs that spoke on topics such as fame, romance, and self-love.[7] Montag cited her husband, whom she married during the album's production, as her inspiration when selecting the love songs.[7]

Superficial charm can be self damaging. The ability to be superficially charming often leads to success in areas like the theatre, salesmanship, or politics and diplomacy. In excess, being adept in social intelligence and endlessly taking social cues from other people, can lead to the sacrificing of one's motivations and sense of self.[5]

Superficial charm can be exploitative. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder, for example, are known to have limited guilt or anxiety when it comes to exploiting others in harmful ways. While intimidation and violence are common means of exploitation, the use of superficial charm is not uncommon.[6] Superficial charm is listed on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist.
Superficial charm (or insincere charm) refers to the social act of saying or doing things because they are well received by others, rather than what one actually believes or wants to do. It is sometimes referred to as "telling people what they want to hear".[1] Superficial charm is a generally effective way to ingratiate or persuade[2] and it is one of the many elements of impression management/self-presention.[3]

Flattery and charm accompanied by obvious ulterior motives is generally not socially appreciated, and most people consider themselves to be skilled at distinguishing sincere compliments from superficial,[2] however, researchers have demonstrated that even obviously manipulative charm can be effective.[4] While expressed attitudes are negative or dismissive, implicit attitudes are often positively affected.[2][4] The effectiveness of charm and flattery, in general, stems from the recipient’s natural desire to feel good about one's self.[4]

A fascial compartment is a section within the body that contains muscles and nerves and is surrounded by fascia. In the human body, the limbs can each be divided into two segments: The upper limb can be divided into the arm and the forearm and the sectional compartments of both of these – the fascial compartments of the arm and the fascial compartments of the forearm contain an anterior and a posterior compartment. The lower limbs can be divided into two segments – the leg and the thigh – and these contain the fascial compartments of the leg and the fascial compartments of the thigh.

A fascia (/ˈfæʃ(i)ə/; plural fasciae /ˈfæʃii/ or fascias;[1] adjective fascial; from Latin: "band") is a band or sheet of connective tissue, primarily collagen, beneath the skin that attaches to, stabilizes, encloses, and separates muscles and other internal organs.[2] Fascia is classified by layer, as superficial fascia, deep fascia, and visceral or parietal fascia, or by its function and anatomical location.
Superficial fascia is the lowermost layer of the skin in nearly all of the regions of the body, that blends with the reticular dermis layer.[5] It is present on the face, over the upper portion of the sternocleidomastoid, at the nape of the neck, and overlying the breastbone.[6] It consists mainly of loose areolar, and fatty adipose connective tissue and is the layer that primarily determines the shape of a body.[medical citation needed] In addition to its subcutaneous presence, superficial fascia surrounds organs and glands, neurovascular bundles, and is found at many other locations where it fills otherwise unoccupied space. It serves as a storage medium of fat and water; as a passageway for lymph, nerve and blood vessels; and as a protective padding to cushion and insulate.[7]
lesson1layersofbody at The Anatomy Lesson by Wesley Norman (Georgetown University)
Visceral fascia is less extensible than superficial fascia.Due to its suspensory role of the organs, it needs to maintain its tone rather consistently. If it is too lax, it contributes to organ prolapse, yet if it is hypertonic, it restricts proper organ motility.[10]
Like ligaments, aponeuroses, and tendons, fascia is made up of fibrous connective tissue containing closely packed bundles of collagen fibers oriented in a wavy pattern parallel to the direction of pull. Fascia is consequently flexible and able to resist great unidirectional tension forces until the wavy pattern of fibers has been straightened out by the pulling force.These collagen fibers are produced by fibroblasts located within the fascia.[2]
Fascia becomes important clinically when it loses stiffness, becomes too stiff, or has decreased shearing ability.[16] When inflammatory fasciitis or trauma causes fibrosis and adhesions, fascial tissue fails to differentiate the adjacent structures effectively. This can happen after surgery, where the fascia has been incised and healing includes a scar that traverses the surrounding structures.
Fasciae are similar to ligaments and tendons as they have collagen as their major component. They differ in their location and function: ligaments join one bone to another bone, tendons join muscle to bone, and fasciae surround muscles and other structures.

There exists some controversy about what structures are considered "fascia", and how types of fascia should be classified.[3] The two most common systems are:

The skin of the organ is known as the visceral layer. The organs have specialized names for their visceral fasciae.In the brain, they are known as meninges; in the heart they are known as pericardia; in the lungs, they are known as pleurae; and in the abdomen, they are known as peritonea.[9]
Visceral fascia (also called subserous fascia) suspends the organs within their cavities and wraps them in layers of connective tissue membranes.Each of the organs is covered in a double layer of fascia; these layers are separated by a thin serous membrane.
Due to its viscoelastic properties, superficial fascia can stretch to accommodate the deposition of adipose that accompanies both ordinary and prenatal weight gain. After pregnancy and weight loss, the superficial fascia slowly reverts to its original level of tension.

Deep fascia is a layer of dense fibrous connective tissue which surrounds individual muscles, and also divides groups of muscles into fascial compartments.This fascia has a high density of elastin fibre that determines its extensibility or resilience.[11] Deep fascia was originally considered to be essentially avascular but later investigations have confirmed a rich presence of thin blood vessels.[12] Deep fascia is also richly supplied with sensory receptors.[13] Examples of deep fascia are fascia lata, fascia cruris, brachial fascia, plantar fascia, thoracolumbar fascia and Buck's fascia.
Fasciae were traditionally thought of as passive structures that transmit mechanical tension generated by muscular activities or external forces throughout the body. An important function of muscle fasciae is to reduce friction of muscular force.In doing so, fasciae provide a supportive and movable wrapping for nerves and blood vessels as they pass through and between muscles.[14]Fascial tissues are frequently innervated by sensory nerve endings. These include myelinated as well as unmyelinated nerves. Based on this a proprioceptive, nociceptive as well as interoceptive function of fascia has been postulated.[15]Fascial tissues – particularly those with tendinous or aponeurotic properties – are also able to store and release elastic potential energy.

In response, Baker stated that he had simply wanted Taylor to rewrite his verse, reiterating his previous assertion that it was "really bad."[109]

Following the release of Black Flag, rumors surfaced that Baker had begun working on his second studio album. In January 2014, he confirmed that he was in the early stages of working on the album, with 2015 being the scheduled year of release.[31] On January 5, 2015, Baker released the song "Till I Die", which was accompanied with a music video on his VEVO account. Months later, a remix of "Till I Die" with hometown fellow hip-hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony was confirmed and released on June 5, 2015. The song aired via WorldStarHipHop and featured French Montana, Yo Gotti and Ray Cash. On May 18, 2015, the music video for another song titled "A Little More" was released, with the single featuring vocals from Victoria Monet. Baker soon had an interview with MTV, describing the reason as to why he wrote "A Little More". Stating in the interview: "People always came up to me after the first album and a lot of my friends back home said 'we need something for the streets' and then I did Till I Die. Months later, when I look back at the video [for Till I Die] I [was] like 'Okay, he's in jail, he's shot, he's dead, he snitched' and just to the point where it's sad and I wrote the song to describe how I see the world as a much mature person." He also updated the status on his second studio album, noting that the album is finished, and stating that the album would contain "more lyricism and [would be more] stylistically [influenced by] hip-hop but musically, sonically [would contain] more live instrumentation."[32]

In 2021, Baker engaged in a feud with Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor after being alluded to in an interview where Taylor stated: "I hate all new rock for the most part — well, the artists who failed in one genre and decided to go rock. And I think he knows who he is, but that’s another story."[105] At Riot Fest in September 2021, Baker and Slipknot were scheduled to play on the same day and time, albeit on different stages. Baker took the opportunity to respond to Taylor's comments, beginning his set by asking the crew to light the crowd so he could "see who chose to be here instead of with all the old weird dudes with masks." He later insulted the band again by stating, "You wanna know what I’m really happy that I'm not doing? Being 50 years old, wearing a fuckin’ weird mask on a fuckin’ stage, talking shit."[106][107]

"More is More" is an uptempo dance-pop song that makes heavy use of synthesizers, especially the auto-tune software to alter Montag's voice. Lyrically, the song is about going to the club with friends, drinking and receiving male attention. In the second half of the song, the lyrics switch from being club-oriented to more sexual.

Simpson came to prominence as a teen idol in the late 1990s and the media described her as Columbia Records's "blond response to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera", who had achieved recent success with their respective debut albums.[162][150] Her debut album, Sweet Kisses (1999) mostly explores themes such as love,[150] and Simpson announced that she would remain abstinent until marriage.[1][163] She went through a "carefully orchestrated sexy makeover" while she promoted her second album, Irresistible (2001).[163] Simpson later described Columbia's record executive Tommy Mottola as abusive, as he attempted to control her image and told her to "lose fifteen pounds" after she signed her contract in 1997.[162]

The media also described her as a sex symbol.[167] Simpson's portrayal of Daisy Duke furthered her sex-symbol image,[168] and she portrayed the character in her "These Boots Are Made For Walkin" music video, which presents "footage of Simpson writhing suggestively against a suds-soaked motor vehicle".[169] The scene was parodied in Pink's "Stupid Girls" music video.[170] Simpson also appeared as Daisy Duke in several television commercials for Pizza Hut airing during the Super Bowl in 2006 and 2007.[171] Simpson claimed that the "[Daisy Duke] role created a "gold standard" that she would be judged by in the years that followed",[168] and the media scrutinized her intensely following her weight gain in 2009.[172][173]

Simpson was born on July 10, 1980, in Abilene, Texas.[1] She is the first child of Tina Ann Simpson (née Drew), a homemaker,[2] and Joseph Simpson, a psychologist and Baptist youth minister.[citation needed] Simpson's parents married in 1978; they divorced in 2013.[3][4][5][6] Simpson has stated that she grew up in Dallas and Waco, but her parents now live in McGregor, Texas.[7] Simpson has a younger sister, Ashlee.[8] In her preteens she briefly attended Amelia Middle School while her father did outreach in Cincinnati, Ohio. After moving back to Texas 20 months later, she attended J. J. Pearce High School in Richardson during her teenage years, though she had to drop out in 1997 as her career began to take off; a year later she later earned her GED via distance learning through Texas Tech High School.[9][10][11] Simpson was raised in the Christian faith, and was given a purity ring by her father when she was twelve years old.[12] Jessica and her family moved frequently due to her father's job as a minister, though they remained in Texas for the most part; however, they did live in the Midwest for a few years.[13]

Upon Simpson's rise to stardom with the success of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica in 2003, media critics and the public perceived her as a "ditzy blonde" based on her antics and comments on the show.[164][165][166] The Washington Post's Emily Yahr called her "one of our first reality TV stars, before anyone could absorb the psychological damage it could cause."[162] Simpson recalled her time in the show in her 2020 memoir Open Book, saying: "Nowadays, I see so many people performing their identities on social media, but I feel like I was a guinea pig for that. How was I supposed to live a real, healthy life filtered through the lens of a reality show? If my personal life was my work, and my work required me to play a certain role, who even was I anymore?"[162]

Work on her second album began in 2000, opting to record more "radio-friendly" and upbeat songs for the record.[31] During the recording of the album, Simpson adopted a more mature public image, a decision Simpson and her record label made in hopes to achieve the success of artists such as Spears.[31] While working on the record, Simpson ended her relationship with Lachey to focus on furthering her career; however, the two reconciled romantically that September.[30] In a July 2001 interview with Coventry Newspapers, Simpson explained "I recorded [Sweet Kisses] when I was seventeen years old and I'm twenty-one [this month] so there is four years of growth involved."[32] Simpson released the record's title track, "Irresistible" (2001) as the lead single from the project in April.[33] The single received a generally mixed reaction from critics due to its sexual themes,[34] though it became her second top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[35][36]

Simpson has listed Whitney Houston,[146] Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin and Sade as influences on her music.[147] She attempted to launch her career as a Christian music singer, and at one point completed a self-titled album of Christian music.[13] When she signed with Columbia Records in 1998, she began working on an album of pop music.[13] Simpson has recorded songs with Christian themes in later years, including "Pray Out Loud" (2008).[148] The music on her debut album consisted of pop ballads primarily, with the intention of showcasing Simpson's vocals.[149] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine opined that the album "position[ed] her as the teen Celine Dion".[150] Most notably, it featured the power ballad "I Wanna Love You Forever" (1999).[151] The work drew comparisons to Mariah Carey.[30] With the release of Irresistible (2001), Simpson recorded more upbeat songs, likening herself to artists such as Britney Spears.[152][153] Songs such as "Irresistible" and "A Little Bit" had more provocative lyrics in comparison to her previous release, with Simpson citing the age difference between the recording of the two albums as the main reason.[31] During the Total Request Live Tour (2001) and her DreamChaser Tour (2001), Simpson incorporated more choreography and backup dancers into her live performances.[154]

Simpson announced her engagement to Nick Lachey in February 2002,[42] with the two holding their wedding ceremony on October 26 in Austin, Texas.[43] Simpson also began working on her third studio album in 2002. The album's lead single, "Sweetest Sin" (2003), dealt with the topic of Simpson losing her virginity to Lachey lyrically.[44] The song failed to achieve commercial success. Simpson's father pitched an idea to MTV about a reality show starring the couple, resulting in the creation of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.[45] The series focused on the marriage between Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley initially, but the two backed out, allowing Simpson and Lachey to replace them.[46] The show, which focused on the couple's marriage and the recording of Simpson's third studio album primarily, premiered on August 19, 2003.[47][48] The show became a pop culture phenomenon instantly, with Simpson's perceived "dumb blonde" antics on the show helping to make the couple a household name.[49][50] The series was a ratings success for MTV and aired for three seasons until 2005.[50]

Simpson began working on her third studio album in 2002 initially, on which rapper Missy Elliott would serve as the primary producer.[155] The record later took on a new direction, which her then-husband Nick Lachey described as "organic" in comparison to her two prior albums.[156] Simpson also began co-writing songs for the record, something she had been nervous to do in the past.[156] The result was In This Skin (2003), a record that AllMusic said "stay[ed] within the contemporary dance-pop realm while inching toward the middle-of-the-road diva that she's always yearned to be."[30] Simpson worked with elements of country music with the release of "These Boots Are Made For Walkin'" (2005), recorded for Simpson's feature film debut The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).[157] She continued to experiment with the genre on the song "Push Your Tush" (2006). Numerous songs on her fifth studio album feature elements of dance and disco music, most notably "A Public Affair" and her cover of "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)".[158][159] Inspired by artists such as Faith Hill, Shania Twain, and Martina McBride, Simpson recorded a country music album titled Do You Know (2008).[160] Throughout her career, Simpson has delved into other genres as well, releasing Christmas-themed albums in 2004 and 2010, respectively.[161]

Simpson released her second studio album, Irresistible (2001), in May.[37] The album sold 127,000 copies in the United States during its first week of release, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.[38] Though the album's first week sales nearly doubled those of her previous effort, Irresistible failed to match the success of her debut album; the record earned a gold certification from the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies.[29] "A Little Bit" (2001), the album's second and final single, failed to achieve much success. To promote the record, Simpson embarked as a co-headliner on the Total Request Live Tour (2001) alongside artists such as Destiny's Child and Nelly.[39][40] She later left the tour to launch her own DreamChaser Tour (2001), for which Simpson added choreography and backup dancers to her performances; the tour was canceled following the September 11 attacks.[41]

She began singing in the church choir as a child. When she was eleven, she dreamed of success as a singer while at a church retreat.[13] Simpson auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club at the age of twelve, auditioning with a performance of "Amazing Grace" and dancing to "Ice Ice Baby" (1990).[13] She advanced through multiple rounds, eventually being a semi-finalist for the show alongside artists such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake.[13] Simpson claimed that she became nervous about her final audition after seeing Aguilera perform, and she was not selected for the show, ultimately.[13] Simpson resumed performing in her church choir, being discovered by the head of a Christian music label eventually.[13] He asked her for an audition initially and signed her immediately after she performed "I Will Always Love You" (1973) by Dolly Parton.[13] She began working on her debut album with Proclaim Records and touring to promote the project.[13] Jessica's father later claimed that she had to quit touring as the size of her breasts led to her being deemed too "sexual" for the genre.[13]

Her fifth studio album, A Public Affair (2006), debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 101,000 copies.[28] The album failed to match the success of In This Skin (2003), selling just over 500,000 copies in the United States.[29] The empowerment anthem "I Belong to Me" (2006), which served as the album's second and final single, failed to achieve commercial success.[83] Simpson starred alongside Dane Cook and Dax Shepard in the comedy film Employee of the Month (2006), released that October.[84] The film received a negative critical reaction and failed to achieve commercial success.[85] Simpson performed a cover of the Dolly Parton song "9 to 5" (1980) as a tribute to the artist at the Kennedy Center Awards in December 2006. Simpson forgot the lyrics to the song and the performance received harsh criticism; she also received a chance to redo the song for the cameras, though her performance was cut from the broadcast ultimately.[86][87] Critics noted the underperformance of both Simpson's fifth studio album and her second film as her sister Ashlee experienced a similar decline in success.[88]

In November 2007, Simpson began dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Cowboys fans considered the relationship controversial, as some blamed Simpson for Romo's poor performance in games after the pair got together. Some fans dubbed Simpson "Yoko Romo," a reference to Yoko Ono, to whom many fans of The Beatles attributed the quartet disbanding in 1970. [91] Even then-president George W. Bush commented on the pair's relationship, blaming Simpson implicitly for Romo's lackluster performances.[92] Reportedly, Simpson and Romo ended their relationship in July 2009.[93] During the relationship, Simpson also appeared alongside Luke Wilson in the film Blonde Ambition (2007); it had a limited release in Texas before being released on home media.[94] Later, she starred in the direct-to-video film Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous (2008), portraying an actress who joins the military. The film received a negative reaction overwhelmingly upon its release.[95] Simpson collaborated with Parlux Fragrances to launch her first scent, Fancy, in 2008. The fragrance, unlike Private Valentine, received a positive commercial reaction.[96]

Dennis co-wrote three tracks on the Galantis album Pharmacy, one of which, "Runaway (U & I)", reached No. 1 in the UK Dance Chart, No. 9 in the US Dance Chart, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Most recently Dennis has written with KT Tunstall, Black honey and Sigala.
In 1996, Dennis changed her musical style: away from the dance-pop sound of previous releases, to a more traditional singer-songwriter approach. The resulting album, Am I the Kinda Girl?, was more in keeping with the Britpop sound of bands such as Blur and performers such as Stephen Duffy, and featured collaborations with Guy Chambers of The Lemon Trees and Andy Partridge of XTC. Three singles from the album were released: "West End Pad" (UK No. 25), "Waterloo Sunset" - a cover of The Kinks' song (UK No. 11), and her last solo single, "When Your Dreams Turn to Dust" (UK No. 43).[8]
As of 2015, Dennis became a vocal affiliate with Galantis by first performing, uncredited, on their debut album Pharmacy on the tracks "Runaway (U & I)" and "Louder, Harder, Better".[12] She later co-wrote their song "Love on Me" from their second album The Aviary and sang on five songs from their 2019 album Church.

"Touch Me (All Night Long)" stayed at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, and was kept out of the No. 1 spot by Hi-Five's "I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)" in the first week, and Mariah Carey's "I Don't Wanna Cry" in the second week. The song was a cover and lyrical reworking of a 1984 single by Wish featuring Fonda Rae, which had peaked at No. 70 on the US R&B chart that year. "Touch Me (All Night Long)" reached No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, and its follow-up, "Too Many Walls", which Dennis co-wrote with Anne Dudley of Art of Noise (who also co-wrote the ABC track "All of My Heart"), was a No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit in the United States. It was around this time Dennis agreed to join Club MTV's first tour, booked for six weeks. She dropped out on the third date, later publicly accusing one of Milli Vanilli's members (the tour's headline act) of sexual harassment. During this period, she recorded a song called "Find the Key to Your Life" with David Morales, for the soundtrack to the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. Subsequent releases were only minor hits.
Dennis also co-wrote the international hit "Toxic" by Britney Spears, which went to number one in the UK and worldwide.

Catherine Roseanne Dennis (born 25 March 1969)[1][2] is a British singer, songwriter, record producer and actress. She was the vocalist for D Mob, which had the successful hit single "C'mon and Get My Love". After a successful international solo career, Dennis later achieved great success as a writer of pop songs, scoring eight UK number ones and winning six Ivor Novello Awards.[3] Notably, she co-wrote "Can't Get You Out of My Head" by Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears' song "Toxic", and Katy Perry's hit "I Kissed a Girl".
Dennis released her second album, Into the Skyline, in September 1992, written with a focus toward the US market. The album featured the singles "You Lied to Me", "Irresistible", "Moments of Love", "Falling", and "Why" – the latter was credited to D Mob with Dennis. The album got to No. 8 in the UK Albums Chart, whilst in the US Billboard Hot 100, "You Lied to Me" was a Top 40 hit - her final American Top 40 single as a performer[8] - and "Irresistible" made the Adult Contemporary Top 10; however, the album descended the chart rapidly. Dennis experienced a brief peak of fame, making a cameo in Beverly Hills, 90210 singing the songs "Moments of Love" (a minor US Adult Contemporary chart hit), "Why" (in the episode, not to feature D Mob) and "Touch Me (All Night Long)". In Japan, the album was called Into the Skyline +1, and featured three extra tracks: "Nothing Moves Me", a previous B-side, and two tracks that were both released as singles, "It's My Style", and "Love's a Cradle". She also provided background vocals on PM Dawn's US Top 10 and UK Top 20 hit "Looking through Patient Eyes", released in 1993. In that same year, she sang a duet withLance Ellington on the soundtrack of Robin Hood: Men in Tights

Educated at Taverham High School, as a teenager she was spotted recording Stevie Wonder-influenced demos at The Kitchen in Norwich with her father (himself an experienced musician and local restaurateur) on piano. At the time she was working for Norwich Union. In 1986, Simon Fuller signed Dennis when she was only 17 to his 19 Management company and to label Polydor, and this began a career-long association with the impresario, that has seen Dennis provide songs for many Fuller-related artists and projects.[6][7]

Alongside eventual castmates Lo Bosworth, Kristin Cavallari, and Stephen Colletti, Conradattended Laguna Beach High School. In 2004, they starred in Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, an MTV reality television series which documented their lives during high school. During its production, she was often referred to by the initialism "L.C.", although she has since expressed her distaste for the nickname.[7] The series proved successful for the network;[8] she described the lifestyle it imposed on her as being "definitely a different way to grow up".[9] The first season notably focused on the love triangle between Conrad, Cavallari, and Colletti, and the subsequent feud between the former two.[10] Upon the conclusion of the first season, Conrad appeared on an episode of MTV Cribs.[11] After graduating from high school in 2004, Conrad attended the Academy of Art University in San Francisco for one semester, where she met Heidi Montag.[12] Conrad left the series after the second season,[13] during which period she moved back home and transferred to the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles, though she did not graduate with a degree.[14] After her sister Breanna became a primary cast member, Conrad made a guest appearance on the series during the third season in 2006.[15]
In 2019, MTV screened a revival of The Hills, calling it The Hills: New Beginnings featuring Conrad's former co-stars Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt, Stephanie Pratt, Audrina Patridge, Justin Bobby Brescia, Brody Jenner, Jason Wahler and Whitney Port. A source had said Conrad declined the offer because she felt she was in a different place in life with raising her son, Liam, and working on her line for Kohl's.[89]

"This Hills' Lauren Conrad joined by siblings at Western birthday party"
In September 2010, Conrad was to star in an MTV series that would have focused on her career endeavors, though the network chose not to pick up the program after Conrad preferred not to film her private life.[32] That month, Conrad revealed that she had filmed an alternate ending for The Hills with Jenner.[33] Upon the conclusion of their month-long morning marathon of the series, titled "RetroMTV Brunch", MTV aired the footage in August 2013.[34] The scene depicts Jenner returning to his apartment after seeing Cavallari's limousine off to Europe. Conrad is revealed to be sitting on his couch, and comforts him that "it's hard to say goodbye" to a "friend of [his]", before the camera focuses on a smiling Conrad.[35] That month, she also expressed interest in participating in a potential reunion film.[36] That October, Conrad and her friend Hannah Skvarla opened the online store The Little Market, which distributes handmade pieces from women of varying cultural backgrounds.[37] In December 2013, Montag stated that she and Conrad have "talked a few times" since the series' conclusion, elaborating that "it's unfortunate things happened the way that it did, but we're both different people now, older and more mature."[38]

Since appearing on Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, Conrad has been recognized as being among the first individuals to benefit from the popularity of reality television in the early to mid-2000s. In 2009, Thomas Rogers from Salon described her as "one of the dullest major characters in reality television history", but opined that her normalcy compared to her co-stars on The Hills made her "vaguely likable".[72] An editor from People stated that Conrad "became a full-blown TV phenom" during its third season, which notably introduced the conflict with Montag and Pratt, in addition to controversy regarding scripting allegations.[7]

In 2013, Misty White Sidell from The Daily Beast noted that Conrad established a following based on her respectability instead of "bitch-slaps and drunken sex-capades", further commenting that her more relatable image made her an "anomaly" among television personalities.[73] Conrad herself commented that The Hills was intended to be an "aspirational" program despite being "laced with scandal and catfights", stating that the storyline differed from the "shock value" emphasized in recent programming.[74] Conrad has additionally been recognized for originating several now-famous quotes on The Hills, including "He's a sucky person!" when criticizing Spencer Pratt during the second season, and "You know what you did!" when arguing with Heidi Montag over her alleged involvement with sex tape rumors involving herself in the third season.[75]

In 1990, and again in 1999, the song was remixed by several noted DJs, including Peter Rauhofer and Richard "Humpty" Vission. The 1999 remixes were released to dance clubs. In October of that same year, this renewed interest in the song sent "Situation" to number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart for a second time.

Its most well-known version is the US 12-inch remix by François Kevorkian. This version was included on the US version of Yazoo's debut album, Upstairs at Eric's (1982), and is the version of the song which receives the most radio airplay in the United States (where the song, despite its modest showing on the Hot 100, is still played on alternative, variety-hits and dance-oriented radio stations).

Beat perception refers to the human ability to extract a periodic time structure from a piece of music.[26][27]This ability is evident in the way people instinctively move their body in time to a musical beat, made possible by a form of sensorimotor synchronization called 'beat-based timing'. This involves identifying the beat of a piece of music and timing the frequency of movements to match it.[28][29][30]Infants across cultures display a rhythmic motor response but it is not until between the ages of 2 years 6 months and 4 years 6 months that they are able to match their movements to the beat of an auditory stimulus.[31][32]

Slap bass executions on the backbeat are found in styles of country western music of the 1930s, and the late '40s early '50s music of Hank Williams reflected a return to strong backbeat accentuation as part of the honky tonk style of country.[19]In the mid-1940s "hillbilly" musicians the Delmore Brothers were turning out boogie tunes with a hard driving back beat, such as the No. 2 hit "Freight Train Boogie" in 1946, as well as in other boogie songs they recorded.[citation needed] Similarly Fred Maddox's characteristic backbeat, a slapping bass style, helped drive a rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly, one of the early forms of rock and roll.[20] Maddox had used this style as early as 1937.[21]

"A big part of R&B's attraction had to do with the stompin' backbeats that make it so eminently danceable," according to the Encyclopedia of Percussion.[14] An early record with an emphasised back beat throughout was "Good Rockin' Tonight" by Wynonie Harris in 1948.[15] Although drummer Earl Palmer claimed the honor for "The Fat Man" by Fats Domino in 1949, which he played on, saying he adopted it from the final "shout" or "out" chorus common in Dixieland jazz, urban contemporary gospel was stressing the back beat much earlier with hand-clapping and tambourines.[citation needed] There is a hand-clapping back beat on "Roll 'Em Pete" by Pete Johnson and Big Joe Turner, recorded in 1938.[citation needed] A distinctive back beat can be heard on "Back Beat Boogie" by Harry James And His Orchestra, recorded in late 1939.[16] Other early recorded examples include the final verse of "Grand Slam" by Benny Goodman in 1942 and some sections of The Glenn Miller Orchestra's "(I've Got A Gal In) Kalamazoo", while amateur direct-to-disc recordings of Charlie Christian jamming at Minton's Playhouse around the same time have a sustained snare-drum backbeat on the hottest choruses.[citation needed]

Beats are related to and distinguished from pulse, rhythm (grouping), and meter:
An anticipatory note or succession of notes occurring before the first barline of a piece is sometimes referred to as an upbeat figure, section or phrase. Alternative expressions include "pickup" and "anacrusis" (the latter ultimately from Greek ana ["up towards"] and krousis ["strike"/"impact"] through French anacrouse). In English, anákrousis translates literally as "pushing up". The term anacrusis was borrowed from the field of poetry, in which it refers to one or more unstressed extrametrical syllables at the beginning of a line.[5]
In today's popular music the snare drum is typically used to play the backbeat pattern.[7] Early funk music often delayed one of the backbeats so as "to give a 'kick' to the [overall] beat".[18]

As beats are combined to form measures, each beat is divided into parts. The nature of this combination and division is what determines meter. Music where two beats are combined is in duple meter, music where three beats are combined is in triple meter. Music where the beat is split in two are in simple meter, music where the beat is split in three are called compound meter. Thus, simple duple (24, 44, etc.), simple triple (34), compound duple (68), and compound triple (98). Divisions which require numbers, tuplets (for example, dividing a quarter note into five equal parts), are irregular divisions and subdivisions. Subdivision begins two levels below the beat level: starting with a quarter note or a dotted quarter note, subdivision begins when the note is divided into sixteenth notes.

Some songs, such as The Beatles' "Please Please Me" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand", The Knack's "Good Girls Don't" and Blondie's cover of The Nerves' "Hanging on the Telephone", employ a double backbeat pattern.[22] In a double backbeat, one of the off beats is played as two eighth notes rather than one quarter note.[22]

Outside U.S. popular music, there are early recordings of music with a distinctive backbeat, such as the 1949 recording of Mangaratiba by Luiz Gonzaga in Brazil.[17]

In typical Western music 44 time, counted as ".mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4...", the first beat of the bar (downbeat) is usually the strongest accent in the melody and the likeliest place for a chord change, the third is the next strongest: these are "on" beats. The second and fourth are weaker—the "off-beats". Subdivisions (like eighth notes) that fall between the pulse beats are even weaker and these, if used frequently in a rhythm, can also make it "off-beat".[9]

The effect can be easily simulated by evenly and repeatedly counting to four. As a background against which to compare these various rhythms a bass drum strike on the downbeat and a constant eighth note subdivision on ride cymbal have been added, which would be counted as follows (bold denotes a stressed beat):

Afterbeat refers to a percussion style where a strong accent is sounded on the second, third and fourth beats of the bar, following the downbeat.[13]
Rhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of stressed and unstressed beats (often called "strong" and "weak") and divided into bars organized by time signature and tempo indications.

So "off-beat" is a musical term, commonly applied to syncopation that emphasizes the weak even beats of a bar, as opposed to the usual on-beat. This is a fundamental technique of African polyrhythm that transferred to popular western music. According to Grove Music, the "Offbeat is [often] where the downbeat is replaced by a rest or is tied over from the preceding bar".[9] The downbeat can never be the off-beat because it is the strongest beat in 44 time.[10] Certain genres tend to emphasize the off-beat, where this is a defining characteristic of rock'n'roll and ska music.

According to Maceo Parker, Brown's former saxophonist, playing on the downbeat was at first hard for him and took some getting used to. Reflecting back to his early days with Brown's band, Parker reported that he had difficulty in playing "on the one" during solo performances, since he was used to hearing and playing with the accent on the second beat.

Metric levels faster than the beat level are division levels, and slower levels are multiple levels. Beat has always been an important part of music.Some music genres such as funk will in general de-emphasize the beat, while other such as disco emphasize the beat to accompany dance.[4]

James Brown's signature funk groove emphasized the downbeat – that is, with heavy emphasis "on the one" (the first beat of every measure) – to etch his distinctive sound, rather than the back beat (familiar to many R&B musicians) which places the emphasis on the second beat.[34][35][36]

Meter is the measurement of the number of pulses between more or less regularly recurring accents. Therefore, in order for meter to exist, some of the pulses in a series must be accented—marked for consciousness—relative to others. When pulses are thus counted within a metric context, they are referred to as beats.
In music and music theory, the beat is the basic unit of time, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the mensural level[1] (or beat level).[2] The beat is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music, or the numbers a musician counts while performing, though in practice this may be technically incorrect (often the first multiple level). In popular use, beat can refer to a variety of related concepts, including pulse, tempo, meter, specific rhythms, and groove.
This idea of directionality of beats is significant when you translate its effect on music. The crusis of a measure or a phrase is a beginning; it propels sound and energy forward, so the sound needs to lift and have forward motion to create a sense of direction. The anacrusis leads to the crusis, but doesn't have the same 'explosion' of sound; it serves as a preparation for the crusis.[6]

The downbeat is the first beat of the bar, i.e. number 1. The upbeat is the last beat in the previous bar which immediately precedes, and hence anticipates, the downbeat.[5] Both terms correspond to the direction taken by the hand of a conductor.
