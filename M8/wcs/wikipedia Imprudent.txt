In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Imprudence an "average" winner of the 1000 Guineas and an "inferior" winner of the Oaks.[6]

Impudence was a brown mare with a small white star[2] bred in France by Pierre Corbiere. She was sent into training with Joseph Lieux.[3] The filly raced in the colours of Pierre Corbiere's wife.

As a two-year-old in 1946 Imprudence ran three times and won two races. She produced her best performance in defeat when she finished second to Catalina in the Prix de la Salamandre over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in September.[5][3]

Imprudence was back in England on 5 June and, with Johnstone again in the saddle, started the 7/4 favourite for the 169th Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. Wild Child was again in opposition but the best fancied of her the opponents were Solpax (Lingfield Oaks Trial), Mermaid and Netherton Maid (Princess Elizabeth Stakes). Imprudence came home five lengths clear of Netherton Maid, with two lengths back to Mermaid in third.[6]
Imprudence recorded her first major victory in April 1947 when she won the 1600 metre Poule d'Essai des Pouliches from Montenica and Djama. She was then sent to England to contest the 134th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 2 May and stated the 4/1 favourite in a 20-runner field. Ridden by the Australian jockey Rae Johnstone she won by a neck and a head from Rose o' Lynn and Wild Child.[6]
In 1948 Imprudence was bought by Harry Frank Guggenheim[7] and sent to the United States where she raced in the colours of Cain Hoy Stable and was known as Imprudence II. She failed to win in five starts, producing her best effort when second to Camargo in the Molly Pitcher Stakes on 31 July at Monmouth Park.[8]

Impudence was retired from racing to become a broodmare in the United States. She produced at least nine foals and four winners between 1951 and 1967:

Imprudence (1947 – 1967) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She showed very promising form as a two-year-old in 1949 when she won two races and finished second in the Prix de la Salamandre. She reached her peak in the first half of the following year when she won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the 1000 Guineas before recording an emphatic victory in the Epsom Oaks. She made little impact when competing in the United States as a four-year-old. She had some success as a broodmare.

She was sired by Canot who won the Critérium de Saint-Cloud and was placed in the Prix du Jockey Club, Grand Prix de Paris and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Imprudence's dam, the British-bred Indiscretion was an influential broodmare whose other descendants included Definite Article, Rakti and Holding Court.[4]
In August Imprudence was matched against older horses in the Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse and finished second to the Prix Lupin winner Djelal.

Deauville Racecourse was closed during World War II, and the Prix Jacques Le Marois was cancelled in 1940. For the remainder of this period it was switched between Maisons-Laffitte (1941–43, 1945) and Longchamp (1944). It returned to Deauville in 1946, and was opened to horses aged four or older in 1952.

The Fresnay-le-Buffard stud farm became the sponsor of the Prix Jacques Le Marois in 1986. From this point the event was known as the Prix du Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard-Jacques Le Marois.
The event is named in memory of Jacques Le Marois (1865–1920), a president of the venue's former governing body, the Société des Courses de Deauville. It was established in 1921, and was originally restricted to three-year-olds.

Snow Fairy (foaled 12 February 2007) is a retired Thoroughbred racehorse who was bred in Ireland and trained in England by Ed Dunlop. She made little impression on the racecourse as a two-year-old, winning only one race out of six. She started her three-year-old season well, winning a listed race. Snow Fairy then started The Oaks at 12/1. Ridden by Ryan Moore, she won by a neck. Again ridden by Moore, she won the Irish Oaks easily. When taking on older horses for the first time in the Yorkshire Oaks, she finished second to Midday. Following a run in the St Leger, she went to Japan and won the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup followed by the Hong Kong Cup. As a four-year-old in 2011, she won the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup for a second time, but also placed in a number of top races, including third in the Arc de Triomphe and second in the Irish Champion Stakes. She stayed in training for the 2012 season and won the G1 Prix Jean Romanet at Deauville in August (later disqualified), and then the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September.
Snow Fairy was retired in July 2013 after aggravating a tendon injury.[1] Her owner announced that the filly would be sent to Islanmore Stud in County Limerick for breeding.[2]
In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sun Stream a "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks and the twenty-fifth best filly trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century.[12]
^ "Sun Stream wins 1000 Guineas". Indian Express. 10 May 1945. Retrieved 2012-09-01.
Sun Stream (1942 – January 1959) was a British Thoroughbredracehorse and broodmare, best known for winning two Classics in 1945. The filly won five times from seven races in a track career which lasted from spring 1944 until June 1945. As a two-year-old in 1944 she won three races including the Queen Mary Stakes. After being beaten on her three-year-old debut she won the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and a substitute Oaks over one and a half miles at the same course a month later. After her second classic win she was retired to stud, where her record as a broodmare was disappointing.

As a two-year-old in 1944, Sun Stream was among the best of her generation. She won the Bedford Stakes over five furlongs at Newmarket in spring and then moved up in class for the Queen Mary Stakes in June. The race, traditionally part of the Royal Ascot meeting, was run at Newmarket from 1941 to 1944. Ridden by Harry Wragg, she won the race at odds of 100/30.[7] In autumn, Sun Stream ran in the six furlong Cheveley Park Stakes, Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-old fillies. In a closely contested three-way finish she was beaten into third place by Sweet Cygnet and Neola.[6] She was regarded as one of the best juvenile fillies to race in Britain in 1944.[8]

Sun Stream's racing career took place during World War II during which horse racing in Britain was subject to many restrictions. Several major racecourses, including Epsom, Ascot and Doncaster, were closed for the duration of the conflict, either for safety reasons, or because they were being used by the military. Many important races were rescheduled to new dates and venues, often at short notice, and all five of the Classics were run at Newmarket.[6]
Sun Stream was a chestnut mare with a white blaze and white hind feet. She was bred, like both her parents by her owner Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, the seven-time British flat racing Champion Owner.[1] She was sired by Hyperion, who won The Derby and the St Leger Stakes for Lord Derby in 1933 and went on to become an internationally significant sire: Sun Stream's successes enabled Hyperion to claim the fourth of his six sires' championships in 1945.[2] Sun Stream's dam, Drift, won four races including the Atalanta Stakes[3] and became a successful broodmare, producing the 1,000 Guineas winner Tideway and Heliopolis,[4] a full brother to Sun Stream who was twice Leading sire in North America.[5]

Sun Stream began her three-year-old season in the seven furlong Upwell Stakes, a now discontinued race which served as a trial for the 1000 Guineas, in which she finished second to Exotic.[6] Two weeks later, on VE Day, Sun Stream started 5/2 favourite for the 1000 Guineas which, because of the war, was moved from its traditional venue on the Rowley Mile to the adjoining July course. Ridden by Wragg, she won by three lengths from Blue Smoke, with Mrs Feather a further two lengths back in third. Sun Stream's success gave Lord Derby a seventh win in the race as both owner and breeder,[1] and was very popular with the unusually large crowd.[9]
Lord Derby sent the filly to his private trainer Walter Earl at his Stanley House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.

A month later, Sun Stream returned to the July course on 8 June for the Oaks Stakes. Although the race was not run at Epsom Downs Racecourse it was given its traditional name: wartime runnings at Newmarket had been known as the "New Oaks". The relaxation of wartime restrictions on transport resulted in a huge crowd converging on Newmarket, leading to serious traffic congestion at the course. She started the 6/4 favourite in a field of sixteen fillies. In what was described as "one of the most exciting classic finishes ever contested",[10] Sun Stream won the race by a short head and three quarters of a length from the Aga Khan's Naishapur and Solar Princess. The veteran Harry Wragg was given a great deal of credit for the "mastery" he displayed in the race.[11] She had a particularly hard race in the Oaks[6] and did not compete again.

Sun Stream retired from racing to become a broodmare at her owner's stud. She produced four minor winners, but nothing of top class. Through her daughter Riviera, she was the female ancestor of the Champion Hurdler Collier Bay.[13] Sun Stream was euthanised in January 1959.[14]

Equineline.
In the official European classification of for 2020 Mother Earth was given a rating of 111, making her the sixth best two-year-old filly of the season.[12]
On 19 July at the Curragh Mother Earth was stepped up to Group 2 class for the Airlie Stud Stakes and finished third of the four runners behind Aloha Star and Frenetic. At the same track on 22 August she came home third behind Pretty Gorgeous and Shale in the Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs. On 13 September the filly was moved up to Group 1 class for the Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh. She led for most of the way before tiring in the last quarter mile and coming home eleventh of the thirteen runners behind Shale. On 9 October Mother Earth was sent to England and moved up in distance for the Fillies' Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Starting at odds of 18/1 she was restrained towards the rear of the field before making steady progress to take third place behind Pretty Gorgeous and Indigo Girl.[9] She was initially reported to have finished in eighth place, while her stablemate Snowfall had finished third, but in a bizarre postscript to the race it was revealed that the two Aidan O'Brien runners had carried the wrong number cloths and been ridden by the wrong jockeys, meaning that the filly who finished third was actually Mother Earth.[10] For her final run of the year the filly was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf over one mile at Keeneland on 6 November. Ridden by Ryan Moore she was restrained towards the rear of the field before "staying on strongly" to take second place behind Aunt Pearl.[11]

On 2 May Mother Earth started at odds of 10/1 in an eleven-runner field for the 208th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. With Ryan Moore opting to ride the O'Brien stable's more fancied runner Santa Barbara, Mother Earth was partnered by the veteran Frankie Dettori. The other contenders included Alcohol Free, Sacred (winner of the Nell Gwyn Stakes), Saffron Beach (Oh So Sharp Stakes), Fev Rover (Prix du Calvados) and Star of Emaraaty (Sweet Solera Stakes). After being restrained by Dettori in the early stages as Statement and Fev Rover disputed the early lead Mother Earth moved up on the far side to take the lead just inside the last quarter mile and "kept on well" to win by a length from Saffron Beach.[13] After the race Dettori said "I'm super-excited to win that. I didn’t have the pressure of riding the favourite and I had a very willing partner with a filly that I knew was going to give me everything. Aidan gave me a lot of confidence this morning. He said: ‘Forget about Santa Barbara, just ride your own race.’ I forgot about Santa Barbara, kicked at the top of the hill, I knew she'd stay really well and she did and I won, it's as simple as that."[14] Two weeks after her win in the 1000 Guineas Mother Earth started 1.7/1 favourite for the French equivalent, the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. After settling in sixth place she moved up to briefly take the lead 150 metres from the finish but was overtaken and beaten into second place by the 38/1 outsider Coeursamba.[15]
Mother Earth began her racing career in a maiden race over five and a half furlongs at Navan Racecourse on 10 June when she started at odds of 4/1 in a fourteen-runner field. Ridden by Wayne Lordan she kept on well in the closing stages to finish second, beaten one and a half lengths by the winner Frenetic.[6] Nine days later she was sent to England and stepped up to Group 3 class for the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot when she was ridden by Ryan Moore and finished third behind Dandalla and Setarhe after being repeatedly hampered as she attempted to obtain a clear run. At Naas Racecourse on 4 July Mother Earth went off the 10/11 favourite for the Group 3 Fillies' Sprint Stakes over six furlongs on soft ground. With Lordan in the saddle she disputed the lead from the start, went clear of her opponents in the final furlong and won by four lengths from the Jessica Harrington-trained Sussex Garden.[7] After the race Lordan commented: "She's a smashing filly and her form was good enough to win. I travelled easy and she's a filly that's going to stay further, so I was happy to go forward. When I got there she probably thought she'd done enough. She's a smart filly."[8]
Mother Earth was inbred 3 × 4 to Danzig, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

Mother Earth (foaled 24 April 2018) is an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse. As a two-year old in 2020 she ran eight times, winning the Fillies' Sprint Stakes and finishing placed in the Albany Stakes, Airlie Stud Stakes, Debutante Stakes, Fillies' Mile and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf. On her first run of 2021 she won the 1000 Guineas.

She was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Zoffany, who won the Phoenix Stakes as a two-year-old but produced his best effort when running a close second to Frankel in the St James's Palace Stakes. His other foals have included Albigna, Thunder Moon, Ventura Storm (Gran Premio del Jockey Club), Washington DC (Windsor Castle Stakes) and Fleeting (May Hill Stakes).[3] Mother Earth's dam Many Colours showed good racing ability, winning five races including the Listed Dance Design Stakes.[4] As a female-line descendant of the Irish broodmare Fair Astronomer, she was related to several major winners including Deputy Commander, Malhub, Roger Barows, Donna Blini and Gentildonna.[5]

Mother Earth is a bay filly with a white star bred in Ireland by the County Tipperary-based Grenane House Stud. She was consigned to the Goffs Orby Yearling Sale in October 2019 and was bought for €150,000 by Michael Magnier on behalf of the Coolmore Stud organisation.[2] The filly was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle and raced in the colours of the Coolmore partners Derrick Smith, Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor.
Ermine marks: The occurrence of black marks on a white marking, most often seen on leg markings just above the hoof. May cause the hoof to be striped.
A freeze brand on a horse's shoulder, a common spot for branding.
Bald face: a very wide blaze, extending to or past the eyes. Some, but not all, bald faced horses also have blue eyes.
Leopard complex: Responsible for a variety of patterns, typically leopard-type spotting, and is most closely identified with the Appaloosa breed.
Birdcatcher spots are small white spots, about the size of a dime to the size of a quarter. They have not been linked to any specific breed, but they do tend to run in families. These spots may occur late in a horse's life, or may occur and then disappear. The spots may look like scars, but they are not caused by skin damage. The name comes from a Thoroughbred horse named Birdcatcher, who had similar flecks of white on his flank and tail.[6]
"Medicine hat": An unusual type of Pinto or Paint coloring where the horse has dark ears and poll (like a hat on the head), but surrounded on all sides of the head and neck by white.[5]
On a gray horse, markings visible at birth may become hidden as the horse turns white with age, but markings can still be determined by trimming the horse's hair closely, then wetting down the coat to see where there is pink skin and black skin under the hair.
A horse with "high white," including stockings on all four legs
"Glass" eye, "Moon" eye, "China" eye, "Wall" eye or "Night" eye: A blue eye. Horses with blue eyes are less common than horses with brown eyes, but can see equally well. An eye can also be partially blue.
Rainscald or Dermatophilus congolensis can leave a horse with small white spots, especially along the topline.
A white marking on the crest of a horse's neck artificially created by freeze branding, a form of marking for identification claimed to be nearly painless to the horse.
Chestnuts: A callous-like area on the inside of the horse's leg that has a subtle pattern, but one unique to each horse. It has been proposed that chestnuts could be used as a type of "fingerprint" to identify a horse, but the idea has failed to become widespread in practice, probably in part because the chestnut continually grows and sheds, making precise measurement a challenge.
Bay: A horse coat color that features black point coloration on a red base coat. All bay horses have a black mane, tail and legs (except where overlain by white markings), caused by the presence of the agouti gene. Most have black hairs along the edges of their ears and on their muzzles, and occasionally will have a slight darkening of the hairs along their backbone.
1Types of white markings											Toggle Types of white markings subsection																					1.1Facial markings																											1.2Leg markings
Markings on horses are usually distinctive white areas on an otherwise dark base coat color. Most horses have some markings, and they help to identify the horse as a unique individual.Markings are present at birth and do not change over the course of the horse's life. Most markings have pink skin underneath most of the white hairs, though a few faint markings may occasionally have white hair with no underlying pink skin. Markings may appear to change slightly when a horse grows or sheds its winter coat, however this difference is simply a factor of hair coat length; the underlying pattern does not change.
Star:a white marking between or above the eyes. If a stripe or blaze is present, a star must be significantly wider than the vertical marking to be designated separately.
Irregular or crooked: A marking, usually a strip or blaze, that does not have a more or less straight path.
Shield: A dark Pinto marking where the horse has a dark colored chest, surrounded completely by white on the shoulders, legs, belly and neck. Occasionally used to describe the rarer example of a horse with a totally dark head surrounded completely by white.
Some horse coat colors are distinguished by unique patterns. However, even for horses with coat colors that are arranged in a manner unique to each individual horse, these patterns are not called "markings." Some coat colors partially distinguished by unique patterning include:
Roan: A horse coat color that features white and dark hairs intermingled together, but the horse has head and legs of the base color with very little white. Roans sometimes have dark areas on their coats similar to Bend-Or spots, called "corn marks".

Christopher McGrath (2017). Mr. Darley's Arabian. ISBN 9781681773902. Within five years of his death, one expert would concede: 'It cannot be denied that 'Irish Birdcatcher' has done more for the racehorse than any stallion of modern days - probably than ever was heard of; not alone in speed, but in symmetry of shape and power.' His imprint on the Darley Arabian line was to become so indelible that even today silver flecks in the root of a horse's tail, or scattered over the flanks, are known as 'Birdcatcher ticks'. [from the first page of chapter 12]
Partial: An irregular marking that only extends up part of the leg to the height indicated, sometimes with the other side of the leg dark. Usually used to describe socks and other short markings.
"Dominant White Mutations – W5, W10, W20, and W22". UC Davis Veterinary Genetics Laboratory. Retrieved Aug 15, 2020.
Interrupted: A marking, usually a strip or blaze, that is broken and not solid for the entire length of the face.
Additional terms used to describe facial markings include the following:
Blaze: a wide white stripe down the middle of the face.
Shorter marking is sometimes called a "fetlock" or a "sock," taller marking is clearly a sock
Dun: A horse coat color that features primitive markings: a slightly darker hair shade from the base coat located in a dorsal stripe along the horse's backbone, horizontal striping on the upper legs and sometimes transverse striping across the shoulders. These markings identify a horse as a dun as opposed to a buckskin or a bay.
Horses may develop white markings over areas where there was an injury to the animal, either to cover scar tissue from a cut or abrasion, or to reflect harm to the underlying skin or nerves. One common type of scarring that produces patches of white hairs are "saddle marks," which are round or oval marks on either side of the withers, produced by a pinching saddle that had been worn over a long period of time.
Strip, stripe, or race:a narrow white stripe down the middle of the face.
Recent studies have examined the genetics behind white markings and have located certain genetic loci that influence their expression.[1]

Pinto: A horse coat color that is distinguished by one of several possible broad spotting patterns, as opposed to the smaller spots typical of the Appaloosa. Variations include Piebald, Skewbald, Overo, Tobiano, Tovero and Sabino.
Sock: white marking that extends higher than the fetlock but not as high as the knee or hock. This marking is sometimes called a "boot."

Leg markings are usually described by the highest point of the horse's leg that is covered by white. As a general rule, the horse's hoof beneath a white marking at the coronary line will also be light-colored ("white"). If a horse has a partial marking or ermine spots at the coronary band, the hoof may be both dark and light, corresponding with the hair coat immediately above. Where the leopard gene is present, the hoof may be striped even if markings are not visible at the coronary band.

Fetlock or Sock: white marking that extends over the fetlock, occasionally called a "boot."
Leg scars left from pin firing or bar firing, in which an injury is blistered with hot iron, can leave dots or lines of white hair in a very distinct pattern. This is usually seen on Thoroughbreds that have raced. This treatment is not commonly practiced, but such markings are still occasionally seen.

Horses can be uniquely identified by more than just markings or brands. A few other physical characteristics sometimes used to distinguish a horse from another are:
A horse's genes influence whether it will have white markings, though the exact genes involved could differ between breeds.[2] Chestnut horses generally have more extensive white markings than bay or black horses.[2][3] Horses with the W20 allele typically have white face and leg markings.[4]
In addition to white markings on a base coat, there are other markings or patterns that are used to identify horses as with Appaloosa, Pinto or Brindle, as well as artificial markings such as branding.

Coronet: white just above the hoof, around coronary band, usually no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the hoof.

Facial markings are usually described by shape and location. There may be more than one distinct facial marking and if so, will be named separately. Occasionally, when a white marking extends over an eye, that eye may be blue instead of brown, though this is not consistently seen in all cases.
"High White:" White stockings that extend above the knee or hock, sometimes extending past the stifle onto the flank or belly, considered characteristic of the sabino color pattern.
^ "Birdcatcher Spots Explained". Equus Magazine. {{cite magazine}}: Cite magazine requires |magazine= (help)
Scarring on a horse usually results in white hairs growing in over the injured area, though occasionally there may be no hair growth over the scar at all.
Irregular: A marking within the broad confines of a given height, but with significantly uneven edges. Indicated by the highest point of the white. Most often used to describe certain types of stockings.
Rieder, Stefan; Hagger, Christian; Obexer-Ruff, Gabriela; Leeb, Tosso; Poncet, Pierre-André (2008). "Genetic Analysis of White Facial and Leg Markings in the Swiss Franches-Montagnes Horse Breed". Journal of Heredity. 99 (2): 130–136. doi:10.1093/jhered/esm115. PMID 18296388.
Ticking or rabicano involves white flecks of hair at the flank, and white hairs at the base of the tail. The most minimal form can have only striped white frosting at the base of the tail, called a coon tail or skunk tail.[7] Flecks of white on the root of the tail or scattered over the flanks may also be called Birdcatcher ticks.[8]
Lip markings: have no specialized names, usually are described by location, such as "lower lip," "chin", etc. Lip markings may indicate presence of the sabino color pattern.
Faint: A small but permanent marking that usually consists of white hairs without any underlying pink skin.
Saddle marks may be seen on the back or withers as a patch of white hairs, usually a result of wearing an improperly-fitted saddle for long periods, but also could be related to straightforward long-term saddle wear, unclean saddle blankets and other causes. White marks just forward of the withers may be the result of an ill-fitting horse blanket worn for a long period of time.

Roan horses often develop patches of solid (dark) hair on the roan sections of their bodies wherever there has been any scratch or damage to underlying skin, even if only slight. These are sometimes called "corn marks" or "corn spots."
A type of deliberate human-created scarring that results in white hair is Freeze branding, a method of permanently marking a horse for identification purposes. Some forms of hot branding may also scar lightly enough to leave white hairs rather than bare skin.
"Skunk Tailed". American Quarter Horse Association. April 10, 2018. Retrieved Aug 16, 2020.
Whorls, colloquially known as "cowlicks": divergent or convergent patches of hair found anywhere on the body but mostly on the head, neck, chest, belly, or just in front of the stifles. Included as identifying marks for documentation when unusual, such as double whorl on forehead or whorl on the side of the neck.
Brindle: An extremely rare horse coat pattern; it typically features faint vertical striping in a shade slightly diluted from the base coat color.Brindling may be associated with chimerism.
Connected: Occasionally used to describe distinctively different markings that happen to be joined to one another
Horses may have isolated body spots that are not large or numerous enough to qualify them as an Appaloosa, Pinto or Paint. Such markings are usually simply called "body spots," sometimes identified by location, i.e. "belly spot," "flank spot," etc. When this type of isolated spotting occurs, it may involve one of the splashed white, dominant white, or sabino alleles.
Pastern: white marking that extends above the top of the hoof, but stops below the fetlock.

* Tag was inbred 4x4 to Partner and Regulus. This means that both stallions appear twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.
Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut
As a broodmare for the Earl of Egremont she produced eleven foals, including Tag, Gulliver, Lazy, Baby and Old Maid.[1] Lazy was the dam of Ascot Gold Cup winner Anderida. She has descendants today through the grandson of her 1796 daughter by Precipitate, St John, who was sent to Australia in 1836.[7]
On 29 May 1789 at Epsom Downs, Tag competed in her first race, the Oaks Stakes. Along with the filly Hope, she started as the 5/2 joint-favourite. Eighteen fillies had initially been entered for the race, but only seven started. Tag won the race from Earl Grosvenor's sister to Trifle, with Hope finishing in third place, the filly by Magnet in fourth and Restless in fifth. The other two runners could not be placed by the judge.[3] The following day she was withdrawn from a match race against the Duke of Bedford's Skyscraper.[4] In June at Ascot Heath, she lost a mile and a quarter match race against the colt Magpie.[5] Her final race came in July 1789 at Brighthelmstone in a £50 race consisting of four, one mile and three quarter heats. Tag started as the favourite of the four runners, priced at about evens. She won the first heat, Skyrocket won the second heat, but Mentor won the last two heats to win the race.[6]

Tag (foaled 1786) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. She started only three races, and won once, the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs. She was owned by George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, and trained by Frank Neale. As a broodmare for the Earl she produced eleven foals.
Tag was a bay filly bred by George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, and foaled in 1786.[1]She was sired by Trentham, a successful racehorse who ran for eight years, winning many races, including two Jockey Club Plates.[2] Her dam was Venus, a daughter of Eclipse and full-sister to Jupiter, Mercury and Volunteer.[1]

By the mid-1860s, the 1000 Guineas had become one of Britain's most prestigious races for three-year-olds. The five leading events for this age group, characterised by increasing distances as the season progressed, were now referred to as "Classics". The concept was later adopted in many other countries.

European variations of the 1000 Guineas include the German 1,000 Guineas, the Irish 1,000 Guineas, the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the Premio Regina Elena. Other countries to have adopted the format include Australia, Japan and New Zealand.
It is the second of Britain's five Classic races, and the first of two restricted to fillies. It can also serve as the opening leg of the Fillies' Triple Crown, followed by the Oaks and the St Leger, but the feat of winning all three is rarely attempted.
The 1000 Guineas Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old fillies. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late April or early May on the Sunday following the 2000 Guineas Stakes.

The 1000 Guineas is served by trial races such as the Nell Gwyn Stakes and the Fred Darling Stakes, but for some horses it is the first race of the season. The 1000 Guineas itself can act as a trial for the Oaks, and the last horse to win both was Love in 2020.

The 1000 Guineas was first run on 28 April 1814, five years after the inaugural running of the equivalent race for both colts and fillies, the 2000 Guineas. The two races were established by the Jockey Club under the direction of Sir Charles Bunbury, who had earlier co-founded the Derby. They were named according to their original prize funds (a guinea amounted to 21 shillings, or £1.05).

* Ajax was inbred 3x4 to Galopin. This means that the stallion appears once in the third generation and once in the fourth generation of his pedigree.
Ajax (1901 – 15 February 1915) was an undefeated French Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 1904 Prix du Jockey Club and Grand Prix de Paris and was an influential sire.
At stud, Ajax was an influential stallion[4] who sired Union (his first classic winner and the 3rd dam of Le Pacha) and Teddy. His daughters produced the undefeated Havresac II, Invershin, Massine and Le Correge.[1] Ajax died on 15 February 1915.[5]

Ajax was trained by Robert Denman and ridden by jockey, George Stern. In 1904 the three-year-old colt won the two most prestigious races in France, the Prix du Jockey Club[2] and the Grand Prix de Paris[3] before retiring undefeated after five starts.
Bred and raced by Edmond Blanc, he was by Flying Fox and out of Amie, whose sire Clamart also won the Grand Prix de Paris. Ajax is a brother to Adam, a sire who was exported to the United States in 1906 and then in 1908 to Austria.[1]
