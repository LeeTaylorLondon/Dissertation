Callus is of particular use in micropropagation where it can be used to grow genetically identical copies of plants with desirable characteristics. To increase the yield, efficiency and explant survivability of micropropagation, a thorough care is taken for the optimization of the micropropagation protocol. For example, using explants composed of low totipotency cells may prolong the time necessary to obtain callus of sufficient size, increasing the total length of the experiment. Similarly, various plant species and explant types require specific plant hormones for callus induction and subsequent organogenesis or embryogenesis – for the formation and growth of maize calluses, auxin 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was superior to 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), while the development of callus was hindered in prune explants after applying auxin Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) but not IAA.[23][24]

Callus cells are not necessarily genetically homogeneous because a callus is often made from structural tissue, not individual cells.[clarification needed] Nevertheless, callus cells are often considered similar enough for standard scientific analysis to be performed as if on a single subject. For example, an experiment may have half a callus undergo a treatment as the experimental group, while the other half undergoes a similar but non-active treatment as the control group.

In 1908, E. F. Simon was able to induce callus from poplar stems that also produced roots and buds.[26]The first reports of callus induction in vitro came from three independent researchers in 1939.[27]P. White induced callus derived from tumor-developing procambial tissues of hybrid Nicotiana glauca that did not require hormone supplementation.[14]Gautheret and Nobecourt were able to maintain callus cultures of carrot using auxin hormone additions.[citation needed]
Plant callus (plural calluses or calli) is a growing mass of unorganized plant parenchyma cells. In living plants, callus cells are those cells that cover a plant wound. In biological research and biotechnology callus formation is induced from plant tissue samples (explants) after surface sterilization and plating onto tissue culture medium in vitro (in a closed culture vessel such as a Petri dish).[1]The culture medium is supplemented with plant growth regulators, such as auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin, to initiate callus formation or somatic embryogenesis.Callus initiation has been described for all major groups of land plants.
Specific auxin to cytokinin ratios in plant tissue culture medium give rise to an unorganized growing and dividing mass of callus cells. Callus cultures are often broadly classified as being either compact or friable. Compact calluses are typically green and sturdy, while friable calluses are white to creamy yellow in color, fall apart easily and can be used to generate cell suspension cultures and somatic embryos. In maize, these two callus types are designated as type I (compact) and type II (friable).[18]Callus can directly undergo direct organogenesis and/or embryogenesis where the cells will form an entirely new plant.

Plant species representing all major land plant groups have been shown to be capable of producing callus in tissue culture.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] A callus cell culture is usually sustained on gel medium. Callus induction medium consists of agar and a mixture of macronutrients and micronutrients for the given cell type.There are several types of basal salt mixtures used in plant tissue culture, but most notably modified Murashige and Skoog medium,[13] White's medium,[14] and woody plant medium.[15]Vitamins are also provided to enhance growth such as Gamborg B5 vitamins.[16]For plant cells, enrichment with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is especially important.Plant callus is usually derived from somatic tissues. The tissues used to initiate callus formation depends on plant species and which tissues are available for explant culture. The cells that give rise to callus and somatic embryos usually undergo rapid division or are partially undifferentiated such as meristematic tissue.In alfalfa, Medicago truncatula, however callus and somatic embryos are derived from mesophyll cells that undergo dedifferentiation.[17]Plant hormones are used to initiate callus growth. After the callus has formed, the concentration of hormones in the medium may be altered to shift the development from callus to root formation, shoot growth or somatic embryogenesis. The callus tissues then undergo further cell growth and differentiation, forming the respective organ primordia. The fully developed organs can then be used for the regeneration of the new mature plants.

Genes can be inserted into callus cells using biolistic bombardment, also known as a gene gun, or Agrobacterium tumefaciens.Cells that receive the gene of interest can then be recovered into whole plants using a combination of plant hormones.The whole plants that are recovered can be used to experimentally determine gene function(s), or to enhance crop plant traits for modern agriculture.

Plant calluses derived from many different cell types can differentiate into a whole plant, a process called regeneration, through addition of plant hormones to the culture medium.This ability is known as totipotency. A classical experiment by Folke Skoog and Carlos O. Miller on tobacco pith used as the starting explant shows that the supplementation of culture media by different ratios of auxin to cytokinin concentration induces the formation of roots – with higher auxin to cytokinin ratio, the rooting (rhizogenesis) is induced, applying equal amounts of both hormones stimulates further callus growth and increasing the auxin to cytokinin ratio in favor of the cytokinin leads to the development of shoots.[22] Regeneration of a whole plant from a single cell allows transgenics researchers to obtain whole plants which have a copy of the transgene in every cell.Regeneration of a whole plant that has some genetically transformed cells and some untransformed cells yields a chimera.In general, chimeras are not useful for genetic research or agricultural applications.

Callus can brown and die during culture, mainly due to oxidation of phenolic compounds.In Jatropha curcas callus cells, small organized callus cells became disorganized and varied in size after browning occurred.[19] Browning has also been associated with oxidation and phenolic compounds in both explant tissues and explant secretions.[20] In rice, presumably, a condition which is favorable for scutellar callus induction induces necrosis too.[21]

Rubbing that is too frequent or forceful will cause blisters, as opposed to calluses, to form.
Calluses in the hands are frequently associated with manual labor and blue-collar workers.[15][16][17] During the Gads Hill Train Robbery in 1874, the James–Younger Gang purportedly refrained from robbing men with calloused hands, assuming them to be working class laborers.[18][19] Such notion is also present in Māori culture, where the words raupā and raupo refer to hands left cracked and chapped due to manual work, and are used as similes for someone deemed a hard worker.[20][21]

The location of the soft corns tends to differ from that of hard corns. Hard corns occur on dry, flat surfaces of skin. Soft corns (frequently found between adjacent toes) stay moist, keeping the surrounding skin soft. The corn's center is not soft however, but indurated.

Corns and calluses are easier to prevent than to treat.When it is undesirable to form a callus, minimizing rubbing and pressure will prevent callus formation.Footwear should be properly fitted,[10] gloves may be worn, and protective pads, rings or skin dressings may be used.People with poor circulation or sensation should check their skin often for signs of rubbing and irritation so they can minimize any damage.[citation needed]

A corn (or clavus, plural clavi) is a cone-shaped callus that penetrates into the dermis, usually on the feet or hands. Corns may form due to chronic pressure or rubbing at a pressure point (in this skin over a bone), or due to scar tissue from a healing wound creating pressure in a weight-bearing area such as the sole of the foot. If there is constant stimulation of the tissue producing the corns, even after the corn is surgically removed, the skin may continue to grow as a corn.[1][8]

Are Calluses Actually Bad for Your Feet? See What Podiatrists Have to Say
People with diabetes face special skin challenges. Because diabetes affects the capillaries, the small blood vessels which feed the skin, thickening of the skin with callus increases the difficulty of supplying nutrients to the skin.[12] Callus formation is seen in high numbers of patients with diabetes, and together with absent foot pulses and formation of hammer toe,[13][14] this may be an early sign of individuals at an increased risk for foot ulcers.[13]

A callus is an area of thickened and sometimes hardened skin that forms as a response to repeated friction, pressure, or other irritation.Since repeated contact is required, calluses are most often found on the feet and hands, but they may occur anywhere on the skin. Some degree of callus, such as on the bottom of the foot, is normal.[1]
Although calluses can occur anywhere on the body as a reaction to moderate, constant "grinding" pressure, they are mostoften found on the foot (where the most pressure and friction are applied). On the feet, arguably the source of the most problematic calluses, they typically form on the metatarsal-phalangeal joint area ("balls of the foot"), heels and small toes due to the compression applied by tightly fitting shoes.

Biologically, calluses are formed by the accumulation of terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the outermost layer of skin. Though the cells of calluses are dead, they are quite resistant to mechanical and chemical damage due to extensive networks of cross-linked proteins and hydrophobic keratin intermediate filaments containing many disulfide bonds.[7] It is the natural reaction of the palmar or plantar skin. Too much friction occurring too fast for the skin to develop a protective callus will cause a blister or abrasion instead.
Calluses have also been known to develop on the forehead from the frequent prostrations required in Muslim prayer; known as a prayer bump or zebiba, such calluses are considered marks of piety in some Muslim countries, and people have been known to take special steps, such as praying on straw mats, to encourage the callus to develop.[22]
Calluses may also form on the fingertips from the repeated pressure and friction of playing stringed instruments. This formation of calluses allows the player to repeatedly depress the strings without causing pain. Because of this, callus formation is viewed as something of a rite of passage for beginner string players.

Calluses are generally not harmful and help prevent blisters, as well as offering protection.[2] However, excessive formation may sometimes lead to other problems, such as a skin ulceration or infection, or cause the affected person to try to offload the affected painful area, which can place excessive stress on the asymptomatic side.

The hard part at the center of the corn resembles a funnel with a broad raised top and a pointed bottom. Because of their shape, corns intensify the pressure at the tip and can cause deep tissue damage and ulceration.[9] The scientific name for a corn is heloma (plural helomata). A hard corn is called a heloma durum, while a soft corn is called a heloma molle.
Sometimes a callus occurs where there is no rubbing or pressure. These hyperkeratoses can have a variety of causes. Some toxic materials, such as arsenic, can cause thick palms and soles. Some diseases, such as syphilis, can cause thickening of the palms and soles as well as pinpoint hyperkeratoses. There is a benign condition called keratosis palmaris et plantaris, which produces corns in the creases of the fingers and non-weight bearing spaces of the feet. Some of this may be caused by actinic keratosis, which occurs due to overexposure to sun or with age and hormonal shifts.

The specific diagnostic workup and treatments for corns may differ substantially from other forms of calluses.
Calluses and corns may heal by themselves eventually, once the irritation is consistently avoided. They may also be dissolved with keratolytic agents containing salicylic acid, sanded down with a pumice stone or silicon carbide sandpaper or filed down with a callus shaver, or pared down by a professional such as a podiatrist.[11]

The stiffness of a callus or corn, coupled with the shear and pressure that caused it, may tear the capillaries or adjoining tissue, causing bleeding within the callus or corn. This can often be result of trying to pick, cut, or shave off the callus by yourself at home. Although the bleeding can be small, sometimes small pools of blood or hematoma are formed. The blood itself is an irritant, a foreign body within the callus that makes the area burn or itch. If the pool of blood is exposed to the outside, infection may follow. Infection may also lead to ulceration. This process can be prevented at several places.Diabetic foot infections are the leading cause of diabetic limb amputation.
"cruelty: definition of cruelty in Oxford dictionary (British & World English)"
Cruelty is the pleasure in inflicting suffering or inaction towards another's suffering when a clear remedy is readily available.[1] Sadism can also be related to this form of action or concept. Cruel ways of inflicting suffering may involve violence, but affirmative violence is not necessary for an act to be cruel. For example, if a person is drowning and begging for help and another person is able to help with no cost or risk, but is merely watching with disinterest or perhaps mischievous amusement, that person is being cruel—rather than violent.

Beyond serving as an analytical framework, these four conceptions—the distinctive features of each as well as their collective evolution—reflect the reality that “the phenomenon of cruelty […] is a human-made problem that calls for preventive and corrective responses”.[3]

Paulo Barrozo,[3]Cruelty in Criminal Law: Four Conceptions, 51 CRIM. L. BULLETIN 5 (2015).
The term cruelty is often used in law and criminology with regard to the treatment of animals, children, spouses, and prisoners.[4] When cruelty to animals is discussed, it often refers to unnecessary suffering. In criminal law, it refers to punishment, torture, victimization, draconian measures, and cruel and unusual punishment.[5][6] In divorce cases, many jurisdictions permit a cause of action for cruel and inhumane treatment.[7]
^ a b c d e f g h i j k
One criticism of the concept of cruelty points at the concept of conflating disregard for others with hurting others for its own sake, arguing that the two are mutually exclusive as total disregard for what another being feels (be it a human or non-human) would be incompatible with deriving pleasure from hurting that being for its own sake since caring about inflicting suffering would be incompatible with not caring.[10]
The Science of Evil: On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty
The word has metaphorical uses, for example, "The cliffs remained cruel." (i.e., unclimbable when they desperately needed to be climbed) in The Lord of the Rings.
In law, cruelty is "the infliction of physical or mental distress, especially when considered a determinant in granting a divorce."[8]
The first is the agent-objective conception, which is “exemplified by […] agency that goes above in degree and beyond in type the [suffering] allowed by applicable norms.”[3] Under this conception, the victim suffered cruelty in light of “the objective character of the act or treatment” she was subjected to. Cruelty, in this sense, is defined as an “inclination of the mind toward the side of harshness”.[3] Any punishment or other treatment that surpasses the scope of sufficiency and ventures into possibility is classified as excessive, and therefore, cruel.
Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.
The third conception is victim-subjective, in which the “element of cruelty rests in the victim's intense experience of suffering”.[3] Here, the pain or the sense of degradation and humiliation experienced particularly and uniquely by the victim is considered. Recognizing cruelty, then, requires reference to our compassion rather than some normative standard of reasonableness. Continuing with the example of punishment, the state’s intention is not relevant in determining whether a punishment is cruel. According to the law, “ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity”, and this minimum is determined by “all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age, and state of health of the victim, etc.”[3]
There are four distinct conceptions of cruelty. “The differences between these conceptions of cruelty rest on the types of agency, victimization, causality, and values that they employ.”[3]
Barrozo, Paulo (2015). "Cruelty in Criminal Law: Four Conceptions". Crim. L. Bulletin. 51 (5): 1025–1073. SSRN 2663837.
The term comes from Middle English, via the Old French term "crualte", which is based on Latin "crudelitas", from "crudelis".[9]
The fourth and final conception is the accumulation of all the prior conceptions: the victim-objective and agent-independent. This conception “refers to severe violations of the respect, recognition, and care that the unconditional and inherent dignity of each and every individual command”.[3] Under this view, “cruelty occurs when a grave violation of human dignity that in normal circumstances would amount to cruelty is caused by individuals or by the operation of impersonal institutions, structures or social processes, even if the victim is unaware of his predicament”.[3]
George Eliot stated that "cruelty, like every other vice, requires no motive outside itself; it only requires opportunity."[2] Bertrand Russell stated that "the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell."[2] Gilbert K. Chesterton stated that "cruelty is, perhaps, the worst kind of sin. Intellectual cruelty is certainly the worst kind of cruelty."[2]

The second conception is agent-subjective, in which “cruelty obtains only when the agent's deviant behavior is accompanied by the fault of character consisting in deriving personal delight from causing and witnessing suffering”.[3] This conception is best understood under the presumption that punishment or other violence is a means to restore the offset in the cosmic order of the universe caused by wrongdoing. Anything that goes beyond what is necessary for this restoration, then, is cruel; the peace and harmony is not balanced with excessive punishment or violence—the scale of wrongdoing merely tips to the other side. For example, the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, which means that we must “inquire into a prison official’s state of mind […]” when determining that the agent is not taking pleasure in inflicting pain and that punishment does not exceed the crime.[3]

Primatologist Frans de Waal argues that evolutionary theory postulates that biological altruism in primates evolved for the return-benefits it bears the performer.[15] Some evolutionary biologists, therefore, criticize the psychiatric model of callous-unemotional traits (CU) on the grounds that CU is inconsistent with evolutionary continuity. Rather, these biologists argue that if empathy had evolved through mammalian evolution, beginning with empathy restricted to close relatives and extending over the course of evolution to include more distant relatives, then empathy with other humans could be expected to be necessary but not sufficient for human empathy with nonhuman animals. This evolutionary biology model of altruism and empathy thus contrasts with the psychiatric model of CU because the latter implies that cruelty to animals is a predictor of violence to other humans – but not the other way around.[16][17]

A CU specifier for conduct disorder was added to DSM-5.[4] The addition "with limited prosocial emotions" to the conduct disorder diagnosis in DSM-5 is to classify a specific subgroup of antisocial youth with distinguishing antisocial behaviors and psychopathic traits.[6] The provision of the CU specifier for CD youth is claimed to improve the diagnostic power, treatment options, and increase the understanding life-course outcomes.[6] A 2008 review concluded that CU did not have the required evidence base to be included as a new diagnosis in DSM-5.[10]

Parenting interventions are the most commonly used treatment for treating early onset antisocial behaviors and conduct disorder in children, and quality parenting may be able to decrease the manifestation of CU traits.[6][20] Children with high CU traits are less responsive to time-out and other punishment techniques than are healthy children as they are unperturbed by the threat of punishment and time-out does not seem to bother them, so their behavior does not improve.[21] Reward-based disciplining techniques, such as praise and reinforcement, tend to have a greater effect than punishing techniques on children with high CU traits in reducing antisocial behavior.[8]

Twin studies have found CU traits to be highly heritable, and not significantly related to environmental factors such as socioeconomic status, school quality, or parent quality.[6] Two twin studies suggested a significant genetic influence for CU, with an estimated average amount of variation (42.5%) in CU traits accounted for by genetic effects.[6] A substantial proportion of this genetic variation occurred independent of other dimensions of psychopathy.[6] Children with conduct problems who also exhibit high levels of CU traits reflect a particularly high heritability rate of 0.81, as reflected in longitudinal research.[8]

Lack of reaction to what would be a traumatic event
Research has attempted to subtype youth with callous-unemotional traits by distinguishing between those with childhood-onset versus adolescent-onset conduct disorder, conduct disorder co-morbid with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or by the severity and type of aggression displayed.[7]Children with CU traits have more severe conduct disorder, and respond to different management.[4]The Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU) assesses three independent factors in CU traits: uncaring, callous, and unemotional.[18]The severity of CD has been studied in children rated high on CU traits.[8]

Maltreatment and parenting play a role in the development of antisocial behavior, and studies have been shown to prove this. While callous unemotional traits are rooted in genetics, environmental triggers are an important contributing factor for the development of antisocial behaviour in children with the genetic propensity.[14]

The fearlessness theory of CU traits suggests that low amounts of cortisol lead to underarousal, causing impairments in fear processing, a trait seen in CU individuals.[11] Hypoactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axisin combination with CU traits seem to cause antisocial behavior even without external hardships.[11]

Childhood-onset CU shows a more aggressive and stable pattern of antisocial behavior with higher rates of CU traits, as well as more severe temperamental and neuropsychological risk factors relative to their adolescent-onset counterparts.[22] Children with combined CD and ADHD are more likely to show features associated with psychopathy, but only in those who have high rates of CU traits.[23] In support of the idea of lifetime persistence of CU traits, childhood-onset delinquency has been more strongly associated with psychopathic traits than adolescent-onset delinquency.[24] A longitudinal twin study of children with CD showed that high or increasing levels of CU traits comorbid with CD presented with the most negative outcomes after twelve years in relationships with peers and family, as well as emotional and behavioral problems, as compared to those with low CU traits or CD alone.[25] In addition, adolescents with CU traits have shown higher likelihood to commit a violent crime within a two-year period of their release from a correctional facility than those without CU traits.[26] Antisocial youth with CU traits tend to show less response to treatment.[8]

"Extending the construct of psychopathy to youth: implications for understanding, diagnosing, and treating antisocial children and adolescents"
Callous-unemotional traits (CU) are distinguished by a persistent pattern of behavior that reflects a disregard for others, and also a lack of empathy and generally deficient affect.The interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors may play a role in the expression of these traits as a conduct disorder (CD). While originally conceived as a means of measuring the affective features of psychopathy in children, measures of CU have been validated in university samples and adults.[1][2][3]

CU traits are relatively stable, though some studies suggest that they may decrease over time through effective treatment.[6] Early intervention is thought to be more effective because CU traits are thought to be more malleable early in life.[19]

Following the publication of DSM-III, these distinctions prompted research, but there were still issues with the terminology in diagnosing the core features of the undersocialized versus socialized subtype. The word undersocialized was used in order to avoid the negative connotations of psychopathy, but was commonly misinterpreted to mean that the child was not well socialized by parents or lacked a peer group. Also, the operational definition failed to include dimensions that could reliably predict the affective and interpersonal deficits in psychopathic-like youths. Due to these issues, the American Psychiatric Association removed the undersocialized and socialized distinctions from the conduct disorder description in the DSM after the third edition. The only subtypes that have been included in the manual since then relate to the time of onset: childhood-onset (before age 10), adolescent-onset (absence of antisocial traits before age 10), and unspecified-onset.[22]

A systematic review found that CU traits were associated with poorer outcomes in family-based interventions for conduct problems. This suggests pre-treatment data on CU traits is clinically informative in terms of the prognostic status of children and young people with CU traits.[27]

Due to the potential severity of antisocial and violent traits seen in adult psychopathy, research has focused on identifying the associated traits in childhood. In adult psychopathy, individuals with primarily affective and interpersonal deficits show a distinct etiology.[28] Similarly, different subtypes of aggressive and antisocial behaviors in youth may predict distinct problem-behaviors and risk factors. There have been a number of attempts to officially designate psychopathic-like traits in antisocial youths based on the affective and interpersonal traits of psychopathy. The third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III) divided conduct disorder into four subtypes: undersocialized-aggressive, undersocialized-nonaggressive, socialized-aggressive, and socialized-nonaggressive in an attempt to recognize the existence of psychopathic traits in children.[23] The distinction between "socialized" and "undersocialized" children was the most pertinent in distinguishing between psychopathic-like youths.According to these definitions, "undersocialized" children exhibited characteristic behaviors of psychopathy, including: lack of empathy, lack of affection, and inappropriate social relationships (DSM III). This differed from "socialized" individuals, who were able to form healthy social attachments to others, and whose aggressive and antisocial acts typically derived from engagement in a deviant social group (e.g. youth gangs).

A study on a large group of children found more than 60% heritability for callous-unemotional traits and that conduct problems among children with these traits had a higher heritability than among children without these traits.[12][13] The study also found slight sex differences (boys 64%, girls 49%) in the affective-interpersonal factor.[13] Similarly, the impulsive–antisocial factor was primarily influenced by genetic factors (boys 46%; girls 58%)[13]

A CU specifier has been included as a feature of conduct disorder in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).[4]
Children with CU traits have distinct problems in emotional and behavioral regulation that distinguish them from other antisocial youth[6] and show more similarity to characteristics found in adult psychopathy.[7] Antisocial youth with CU traits tend to have a range of distinctive cognitive characteristics. They are often less sensitive to punishment cues, particularly when they are already keen for a reward.[8]CU traits are positively related to good intellectual verbal skills.[9]
CU traits, as measured by the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), are in three categories: callous (reflecting ruthlessness and cruel treatment or disregard for others), uncaring (passive disregard for others and lack of prosocial emotion), and unemotional (limited experience and expression of emotion).[5] Unemotional traits are uniquely elevated in cases reflecting "primary psychopathy".[3]

Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors,[5] its remedies, management, and uses.
^ Examples of physical suffering: pain of various types, excessive heat, excessive cold, itching, hunger, thirst, nausea, air hunger, sleep deprivation. "IASP Pain Terminology". Archived from the original on September 26, 2008. Retrieved September 11, 2008."UAB – School of Medicine – Center for Palliative and Supportive Care". Archived from the original on 2007-10-28. Retrieved 2008-09-11. Other examples are given by L. W. Sumner, on p. 103 of Welfare, Happiness, and Ethics: "Think for a moment of the many physical symptoms which, when persistent, can make our lives miserable: nausea, hiccups, sneezing, dizziness, disorientation, loss of balance, itching, 'pins and needles', 'restless legs', tics, twitching, fatigue, difficulty in breathing, and so on."
Mental suffering can also be called psychological or emotional (see Psychological pain). Examples of mental suffering: depression (mood) / hopelessness, grief, sadness / loneliness / heartbreak, disgust, irritation, anger, jealousy, envy, craving or yearning, frustration, anguish, angst, fear, anxiety / panic, shame / guilt, regret, embarrassment / humiliation, restlessness.
Philosophy of pain is a philosophical speciality that focuses on physical pain and is, through that, relevant to suffering in general.
However..."If people feel unhappy when burdened by negative life events, this is no mental disorder, but “healthy suffering” . It is of great importance not to medicalize such everyday problems."[38]
Many brain structures and physiological processes are involved in suffering (particularly the anterior insula and cingulate cortex, both implicated in nociceptive and empathic pain).[28] Various hypotheses try to account for the experience of suffering. One of these, the pain overlap theory[29] takes note, thanks to neuroimaging studies, that the cingulate cortex fires up when the brain feels suffering from experimentally induced social distress, as well as physical pain. The theory proposes therefore that physical pain and social pain (i.e. two radically differing kinds of suffering) share a common phenomenological and neurological basis.

In Cynicism (philosophy) suffering is alleviated by achieving mental clarity or lucidity (ἁτυφια: atyphia), developing self-sufficiency (αὐτάρκεια: autarky), equanimity, arete, love of humanity, parrhesia, and indifference to the vicissitudes of life (adiaphora).
In sex, especially in a context of sadism and masochism or BDSM, individuals may use a certain amount of physical or mental suffering (e.g. pain, humiliation).

In personal conduct, people may use suffering for themselves, in a positive way.[48] Personal suffering may lead, if bitterness, depression, or spitefulness is avoided, to character-building, spiritual growth, or moral achievement;[49] realizing the extent or gravity of suffering in the world may motivate one to relieve it and may give an inspiring direction to one's life. Alternatively, people may make self-detrimental use of suffering. Some may be caught in compulsive reenactment of painful feelings in order to protect them from seeing that those feelings have their origin in unmentionable past experiences; some may addictively indulge in disagreeable emotions like fear, anger, or jealousy, in order to enjoy pleasant feelings of arousal or release that often accompany these emotions; some may engage in acts of self-harm aimed at relieving otherwise unbearable states of mind.
For Stoicism, the greatest good lies in reason and virtue, but the soul best reaches it through a kind of indifference (apatheia) to pleasure and pain: as a consequence, this doctrine has become identified with stern self-control in regard to suffering.

In Islam, the faithful must endure suffering with hope and faith, not resist or ask why, accept it as Allah's will and submit to it as a test of faith. Allah never asks more than can be endured. One must also work to alleviate the suffering of others, as well as one's own. Suffering is also seen as a blessing. Through that gift, the sufferer remembers God and connects with him. Suffering expunges the sins of human beings and cleanses their soul for the immense reward of the afterlife, and the avoidance of hell.[12]
In politics, there is purposeful infliction of suffering in war, torture, and terrorism; people may use nonphysical suffering against competitors in nonviolent power struggles; people who argue for a policy may put forward the need to relieve, prevent or avenge suffering; individuals or groups may use past suffering as a political lever in their favor.

In arts, literature, or entertainment, people may use suffering for creation, for performance, or for enjoyment. Entertainment particularly makes use of suffering in blood sports and violence in the media, including violent video games depiction of suffering.[46] A more or less great amount of suffering is involved in body art. The most common forms of body art include tattooing, body piercing, scarification, human branding. Another form of body art is a sub-category of performance art, in which for instance the body is mutilated or pushed to its physical limits.

In management and organization studies, drawing on the work of Eric Cassell, suffering has been defined as the distress a person experiences when they perceive a threat to any aspect of their continued existence, whether physical, psychological, or social.[26] Other researchers have noted that suffering results from an inability to control actions that usually define one's view of one's self and that the characteristics of suffering include the loss of autonomy, or the loss of valued relationships or sense of self. Suffering is therefore determined not by the threat itself but, rather, by its meaning to the individual and the threat to their personhood.[26]

The word unpleasantness, which some people use as a synonym of suffering or pain in the broad sense, may refer to the basic affective dimension of pain (its suffering aspect), usually in contrast with the sensory dimension, as for instance in this sentence: "Pain-unpleasantness is often, though not always, closely linked to both the intensity and unique qualities of the painful sensation."[6] Other current words that have a definition with some similarity to suffering include distress, unhappiness, misery, affliction, woe, ill, discomfort, displeasure, disagreeableness.
According to David Pearce’s online manifesto "The Hedonistic Imperative,"[30] suffering is the avoidable result of Darwinian evolution. Pearce promotes replacing the biology of suffering with a robot-like response to noxious stimuli[31] or with information-sensitive gradients of bliss,[32] through genetic engineering and other technical scientific advances.
Social suffering, according to Arthur Kleinman and others, describes "collective and individual human suffering associated with life conditions shaped by powerful social forces".[16] Such suffering is an increasing concern in medical anthropology, ethnography, mass media analysis, and Holocaust studies, says Iain Wilkinson,[17] who is developing a sociology of suffering.[18]

In law, suffering is used for punishment (see penal law ); victims may refer to what legal texts call "pain and suffering" to get compensation; lawyers may use a victim's suffering as an argument against the accused; an accused's or defendant's suffering may be an argument in their favor; authorities at times use light or heavy torture in order to get information or a confession.
See 'Terminology'. See also the entry 'Pleasure' in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which begins with this paragraph: "Pleasure, in the inclusive usages most important in moral psychology, ethical theory, and the studies of mind, includes all joy and gladness – all our feeling good, or happy. It is often contrasted with similarly inclusive pain or suffering, which is similarly thought of as including all our feeling bad." It should be mentioned that most encyclopedias, like the one mentioned above and Britannica, do not have an article about suffering and describe pain in the physical sense only.

Another doctrine related to the relief of suffering is humanitarianism (see also humanitarian principles, humanitarian aid, and humane society). "Where humanitarian efforts seek a positive addition to the happiness of sentient beings, it is to make the unhappy happy rather than the happy happier. ... [Humanitarianism] is an ingredient in many social attitudes; in the modern world it has so penetrated into diverse movements ... that it can hardly be said to exist in itself."[7]

Artistic and literary works often engage with suffering, sometimes at great cost to their creators or performers. The Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database offers a list of such works under the categories art, film, literature, and theater. Be it in the tragic, comic or other genres, art and literature offer means to alleviate (and perhaps also exacerbate) suffering, as argued for instance in Harold Schweizer's Suffering and the remedy of art.[14]

Since suffering is such a universal motivating experience, people, when asked, can relate their activities to its relief and prevention. Farmers, for instance, may claim that they prevent famine, artists may say that they take our minds off our worries, and teachers may hold that they hand down tools for coping with life hazards. In certain aspects of collective life, however, suffering is more readily an explicit concern by itself. Such aspects may include public health, human rights, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, philanthropy, economic aid, social services, insurance, and animal welfare. To these can be added the aspects of security and safety, which relate to precautionary measures taken by individuals or families, to interventions by the military, the police, the firefighters, and to notions or fields like social security, environmental security, and human security.
In law, "Pain and suffering" is a legal term that refers to the mental distress or physical pain endured by a plaintiff as a result of injury for which the plaintiff seeks redress. Assessments of pain and suffering are required to be made for attributing legal awards. In the Western world these are typical made by juries in a discretionary fashion and are regarded as subjective, variable, and difficult to predict, for instance in the US,[22] UK,[23] Australia,[24] and New Zealand.[25] See also, in US law, Negligent infliction of emotional distress and Intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Pessimists hold this world to be mainly bad, or even the worst possible, plagued with, among other things, unbearable and unstoppable suffering. Some identify suffering as the nature of the world and conclude that it would be better if life did not exist at all. Arthur Schopenhauer recommends us to take refuge in things like art, philosophy, loss of the will to live, and tolerance toward 'fellow-sufferers'.
In Judaism, suffering is often seen as a punishment for sins and a test of a person's faith, like the Book of Job illustrates.

Jeremy Bentham developed hedonistic utilitarianism, a popular doctrine in ethics, politics, and economics. Bentham argued that the right act or policy was that which would cause "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". He suggested a procedure called hedonic or felicific calculus, for determining how much pleasure and pain would result from any action. John Stuart Mill improved and promoted the doctrine of hedonistic utilitarianism. Karl Popper, in The Open Society and Its Enemies, proposed a negative utilitarianism, which prioritizes the reduction of suffering over the enhancement of happiness when speaking of utility: "I believe that there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure. ... human suffering makes a direct moral appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway." David Pearce, for his part, advocates a utilitarianism that aims straightforwardly at the abolition of suffering through the use of biotechnology (see more details below in section Biology, neurology, psychology). Another aspect worthy of mention here is that many utilitarians since Bentham hold that the moral status of a being comes from its ability to feel pleasure and pain: therefore, moral agents should consider not only the interests of human beings but also those of (other) animals. Richard Ryder came to the same conclusion in his concepts of 'speciesism' and 'painism'. Peter Singer's writings, especially the book Animal Liberation, represent the leading edge of this kind of utilitarianism for animals as well as for people.

Qualifiers, such as physical, mental, emotional, and psychological, are often used to refer to certain types of pain or suffering. In particular, mental pain (or suffering) may be used in relationship with physical pain (or suffering) for distinguishing between two wide categories of pain or suffering. A first caveat concerning such a distinction is that it uses physical pain in a sense that normally includes not only the 'typical sensory experience of physical pain' but also other unpleasant bodily experiences including air hunger, hunger, vestibular suffering, nausea, sleep deprivation, and itching. A second caveat is that the terms physical or mental should not be taken too literally: physical pain or suffering, as a matter of fact, happens through conscious minds and involves emotional aspects, while mental pain or suffering happens through physical brains and, being an emotion, involves important physiological aspects.

Suffering is often categorized as physical[3] or mental.[4] It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved.

The 'Four Noble Truths' of Buddhism are about dukkha, a term often translated as suffering. They state the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, the Noble Eightfold Path. Buddhism considers liberation from dukkha and the practice of compassion (karuna) as basic for leading a holy life and attaining nirvana.

Suffering plays an important role in a number of religions, regarding matters such as the following: consolation or relief; moral conduct (do no harm, help the afflicted, show compassion); spiritual advancement through life hardships or through self-imposed trials (mortification of the flesh, penance, asceticism); ultimate destiny (salvation, damnation, hell). Theodicy deals with the problem of evil, which is the difficulty of reconciling the existence of an omnipotent and benevolent god with the existence of evil: a quintessential form of evil, for many people, is extreme suffering, especially in innocent children, or in creatures destined to an eternity of torments (see problem of hell).
Friedrich Nietzsche, first influenced by Schopenhauer, developed afterward quite another attitude, arguing that the suffering of life is productive, exalting the will to power, despising weak compassion or pity, and recommending us to embrace willfully the 'eternal return' of the greatest sufferings.[citation needed][8]

The word suffering is sometimes used in the narrow sense of physical pain, but more often it refers to psychological pain, or more often yet it refers to pain in the broad sense, i.e. to any unpleasant feeling, emotion or sensation. The word pain usually refers to physical pain, but it is also a common synonym of suffering. The words pain and suffering are often used both together in different ways. For instance, they may be used as interchangeable synonyms. Or they may be used in 'contradistinction' to one another, as in "pain is physical, suffering is mental", or "pain is inevitable, suffering is optional". Or they may be used to define each other, as in "pain is physical suffering", or "suffering is severe physical or mental pain".

Suffering and pleasure are respectively the negative and positive affects, or hedonic tones, or valences that psychologists often identify as basic in our emotional lives.[27] The evolutionary role of physical and mental suffering, through natural selection, is primordial: it warns of threats, motivates coping (fight or flight, escapism), and reinforces negatively certain behaviors (see punishment, aversives). Despite its initial disrupting nature, suffering contributes to the organization of meaning in an individual's world and psyche. In turn, meaning determines how individuals or societies experience and deal with suffering.

^ See 'Terminology'. See also the entry 'Pleasure' in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which begins with this paragraph: "Pleasure, in the inclusive usages most important in moral psychology, ethical theory, and the studies of mind, includes all joy and gladness – all our feeling good, or happy. It is often contrasted with similarly inclusive pain or suffering, which is similarly thought of as including all our feeling bad." It should be mentioned that most encyclopedias, like the one mentioned above and Britannica, do not have an article about suffering and describe pain in the physical sense only.

For Pyrrhonism, suffering comes from dogmas (i.e. beliefs regarding non-evident matters), most particularly beliefs that certain things are either good or bad by nature. Suffering can be removed by developing epoche (suspension of judgment) regarding beliefs, which leads to ataraxia (mental tranquility).
Health care approaches to suffering, however, remain problematic. Physician and author Eric Cassell, widely cited on the subject of attending to the suffering person as a primary goal of medicine, has defined suffering as "the state of severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of the person".[39] Cassell writes: "The obligation of physicians to relieve human suffering stretches back to antiquity. Despite this fact, little attention is explicitly given to the problem of suffering in medical education, research or practice." Mirroring the traditional body and mind dichotomy that underlies its teaching and practice, medicine strongly distinguishes pain from suffering, and most attention goes to the treatment of pain. Nevertheless, physical pain itself still lacks adequate attention from the medical community, according to numerous reports.[40] Besides, some medical fields like palliative care, pain management (or pain medicine), oncology, or psychiatry, do somewhat address suffering 'as such'. In palliative care, for instance, pioneer Cicely Saunders created the concept of 'total pain' ('total suffering' say now the textbooks),[41] which encompasses the whole set of physical and mental distress, discomfort, symptoms, problems, or needs that a patient may experience hurtfully.
In science, humans and animals are subjected on purpose to aversive experiences for the study of suffering or other phenomena.

Disease and injury may contribute to suffering in humans and animals. For example, suffering may be a feature of mental or physical illness[34] such as borderline personality disorder[35][36] and occasionally in advanced cancer.[37] Health care addresses this suffering in many ways, in subfields such as medicine, clinical psychology, psychotherapy, alternative medicine, hygiene, public health, and through various health care providers.
The nongovernmental research organization Center on Long-Term Risk, formerly known as the Foundational Research Institute, focuses on reducing risks of astronomical suffering (s-risks) from emerging technologies.[43] Another organization also focused on research, the Center on Reducing Suffering, has a similar focus, with a stress on clarifying what priorities there should be at a practical level to attain the goal of reducing intense suffering in the future.[44]

Hinduism holds that suffering follows naturally from personal negative behaviors in one's current life or in a past life (see karma in Hinduism).[9] One must accept suffering as a just consequence and as an opportunity for spiritual progress. Thus the soul or true self, which is eternally free of any suffering, may come to manifest itself in the person, who then achieves liberation (moksha). Abstinence from causing pain or harm to other beings, called ahimsa, is a central tenet of Hinduism, and even more so of another Indian religion, Jainism (see ahimsa in Jainism).

Epicurus (contrary to common misperceptions of his doctrine) advocated that we should first seek to avoid suffering (aponia) and that the greatest pleasure lies in ataraxia, free from the worrisome pursuit or the unwelcome consequences of ephemeral pleasures. Epicureanism's version of Hedonism, as an ethical theory, claims that good and bad consist ultimately in pleasure and pain.

Philosopher Leonard Katz wrote: "But Nature, as we now know, regards ultimately only fitness and not our happiness (...), and does not scruple to use hate, fear, punishment and even war alongside affection in ordering social groups and selecting among them, just as she uses pain as well as pleasure to get us to feed, water and protect our bodies and also in forging our social bonds."[45]

The central villain of the second season. The King of Vestal and a leader of the Vexos. He is the one responsible into invade New Vestroia, capture the Bakugan and them to fight each other to create Mechanical Bakugan as his own weapons.
In episode 7, she teases Ren by saying "Aw, how adorable," because he made friends with the Brawlers and that he forgot who he is and he said that she and the other moles work for him.
Lync is a Ventus brawler. He used mechanical Ventus Altair as his Guardian Bakugan, and mechanical Ventus Wired as a Trap Bakugan. Altair and Wired are able to combine into Meta Altair. However, in Gate Crashers, Altair and Wired were damaged beyond repair, and did not brawl for the rest of the arc. He was a spy for Prince Hydron on Spectra and Gus. He and Volt Luster were the Vexos' tag team champions. He gets defeated by Dan in Invasion of the Vestals, and then again in episode 9 by Ace and Shun in the Bakugan Battle Tournament. He then gets defeated by Baron in episode 11. He went to Earth with Spectra, Gus, Dan, Mira, and Baron. He was stuck on Earth with Alice after rejecting Dan's hospitality. He is seen crying at the end of episode 11. Baron called him 'a little weasel' in episode 11. In the same episode, Gus calls him a snake. He has his Gauntlet taken away by Dr. Gehabich in order to fix his dimension transporter without Lync realizing it (although it would not have mattered, as his Bakugan were destroyed anyhow). Lync eventually makes it home after swearing loyalty to Spectra and when Prince Hydron asked him to spy on Spectra, Lync denies him and helps Spectra with his "ultimate plan". But he then betrays Spectra by locking up Gus so he cannot tell his master of Mylene's escape plan. It is obvious he will do whatever is best for him (going as far as to claim behind Hydron's back "You can count on me to do what's best for me." He later openly admits that he's "very loyal to three people: me, myself and I" in conversation with Volt and the other Vexos), due to his multiple betrayals throughout the series. He later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. He reappears to battle Shun after Zenoheld launches a prototype for the Bakugan Termination System, but is defeated with the combined efforts of Skyress, and a newly evolved Ingram. In Earth Invaders, Lync and Mylene battle Runo and Mira and succeed in obtaining the Subterra attribute energy. He later brawls Ace and Marucho alongside Shadow, taking the Darkus energy. Lync does love Alice. It was this that finally caused him to leave the Vexos when Zenoheld declared that the alternative would be used to wipe out Vestal, Earth, New Vestroia (may have been a likely target as Zenoheld had a grudge against the Bakguan, although it was not mentioned in the list of targets) and anyone else that opposed him. After Volt's departure and "demise" at Hydron's hand, Lync copied the Blue Prints of the alternative to give to Alice (who would warn the resistance). He hesitates to speak to her, feeling guilty about his betrayal of her trust. However he resolves to speak to her. However Hydron appears on the scene (Professor Clay had discovered that Lync had made an unauthorised copy, which Mylene overheard him saying, she reported the incident to Zenoheld, who sent Hydron after Lync) and challenges him to a battle. Lync puts up a heroic and close fight but Aluze is destroyed by Dryoid and he is banished with a death bomb by Hydron (but not before throwing his glove with the data disk towards Alice's home, where she found it later outside, once the battle and its combantants had disappeared from the secene). Lync later appears in Hydron's dreams/hallucinations along with Volt in An Heir To Spare. His fate is unknown.
She seems to have the same kind of love for freedom and initiative to act as Mira does. She also seems to be strong, because she shoulder threw Dan twice in episode 3, the first was by accident and the second was when she got mad at Dan after losing, and in episode 10 when Zenet tried to take her as a hostage and Fabia threw her hard on the ground. Those incidents may prove Ren Krawler's statement about the Neathians' specialty at close combat, although most of what Ren said was a lie to put down the Neathians. Fabia owns Aranaut, the bakugan of her deceased fiancée, Jin. After she becomes the new Neathian Queen in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge, following her sister stepping down from the throne, she gives Aranaut to Captain Elright.
He first appeared in episode 3 unnamed. After meeting Fabia and asked by her if he got her message, he lied saying he did to get her attention. She then challenged him to a brawl, to know if he really did get it. Because Koji undermestiated her he lost. He reappears in episode 22, trying to get into Bakugan Interspace. Julie stops him, however, and tells him about the Gundalian-Neathian war. He leaves, thinking her story is too farfetched and is approached by Stoica who convinces him to go to Gundalia where he is quickly brainwashed by Kazarina. He battle Fabia and Dan with the Mobile Assault Vehicle and nearly wins, but loses when Drago uses his own Mobile Assault Vehicle. He is returned to Earth and wakes up in Bakugan Interspace, having no memory of what transpired. He tells Julie about what happened and vaguely remembers Dan's voice telling him about not give up on him.
Paige (known in the Japanese version as Pamela Schwartz (パメラ・シュワルツ, Pamera Shuwarutsu)) is a new character in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge. She is a Gundalian Soldier who was sent to Earth by Princess Fabia of Neathia to help the brawlers deal with the Mechtagan threat. She is the new Subterra Brawler of the Battle Brawlers. Paige and Boulderon like to charge head first into battle. When Paige first met the Brawlers she was unimpressed with the way they acted and couldn't understand why Rafe looked up to them. Later though Paige changes her mind and figures out why Rafe looks up to them when Marucho comes up with a plan to win a competition. Paige later admits she may have been a bit too hot-headed with her first judgement of Shun and Marucho. After Mag Mel's defeat Paige and Boulderon returned to Gundalia.
Sellon was the leader of the team of the same name, and was artificial creation of Barodius that resembled the appearance of a Neathian. She was a Ventus Brawler. Sellon had a mysterious personality and serious attitude towards brawling. She loved style and grace in a battle, and lived by honor. Unlike most Neathians, whose form is mainly blue and white, Sellon's is black, with tentacle like hair. She also has 6 eye looking adornments on her chest, much like the Chaos Bakugan. At the end of "Dangerous Beauty", she stole Dan's key and gave it to Mag Mel but was then absorbed and was violently killed by him.
They are twin brothers and magician team. They look exactly each other, except Kenta has red hair while Kenji has purple. They were recruited by Masquerade to tag brawl against Runo and Dan, who had never dueled as a team before. They lose after Dan and Runo figure out a strategy but they were winning early in the game since Runo and Dan were fighting and both had separate strategies but after Kenta lost a round he became more impulsive and didn't listen to Kenji's advice. It was also shown that Kenta taught Kenji how to play Bakugan. They use Pyrus and Darkus and their Guardians are Robotallion and Mantris.
In episode 10, she and Lena Isis battled Fabia and Avatar Marucho. She did not do much since Lena did most of the battle. She managed to take down the digital clone Aranaut and Avatar Marucho. After the battle, she suggested taking Fabia as a hostage, and upon approaching Fabia, she was thrown to the ground.
In the first half of New Vestroia, Zenoheld had little interaction with the Resistance or the Vexos. The only time he appeared was when he nagged Hydron for not taking better care of the Dimension Controllers. He seems to be impatient with him due to his constant failure. He will also check in with him and make sure that he is still on the right track, although Hydron shrugs his warnings and discipline off, as he thinks he is doing fine without his father's constant nagging.
After Skyress, Hydranoid, Gorem, Tigrerra and Preyas are rescued, Ace and Percival return to Vestal with Baron and Mira and spread the truth about the Bakugan and the Vexos' actions. After Percival receives the Darkus attribute energy from Exedra, Percival evolves to Knight Percival. While Baron searches for an apartment to move into, Ace helps out but is ambushed by Mylene. He nearly loses but is saved by Klaus. Ace travels to Earth with the Resistance to hide out from the Vexos and protect the Attribute energies. While in hiding, Julie develops a crush on him after watching him work out. When Marucho invents Bakugan Interspace, Ace is set to battle Billy, but also challenges Julie so as to not "get in between the two love birds." Despite Percival becoming immobile, Ace is victorious thanks to his evolved trap Darkus Flash Falcon Fly. After the Resistance decided to go on the attack, Ace and Marucho encounter Lync and Shadow at the Mother Palace. Due to the rigged field, Ace and Marucho lose and the Darkus energy is taken.

In Mechtanium Surge Ren has become the commander of the Gundalian Forces and is reunited with the Brawlers when they come to help Gundalia fight against Mag Mel.
Baron Leltoy's younger sister and the second oldest of the Letloy siblings. She lives with her family on Vestal. She first appeared in episode 28 with Baron's other siblings and appears to show some worry to Baron before he left to meet with Ace and after he lost to Prince Hydron. She appeared again when Baron and the rest of the Resistance had to leave for Earth. In episode 36, Maron uses the Dimension Transporter to visit Baron on Earth. Baron takes her to an amusement park where she showed a lot of excitement. While Baron was showing her how to use a Gauntlet, they accidentally ended up in a battle against Volt Luster (who was battling Shun Kazami). After joining the battle, Maron was watching from a safe distance until some of the attacks landed near her. When she was falling from her lookout post Shun saved her. After the battle before she left for home she gave Shun a kiss on the cheek for saving her. Maron is the main sibling of Baron. It is unknown whether all of Baron's other siblings have a name that rhymes with Baron's, only three other names are known besides Baron and Maron.
In episode 11, he battled alongside Ren, against Shun and Linus. He is strong showing that he defeated Linus and Shun all by himself.
Nurzak's deceased daughter. Apparently, Nurzak had preferred battling in the front over making strategies in the back. Because of his attitude, when he led a group of soldiers, which included Floria, on an attack, they were killed in battle. It is likely that because of Floria's death, Nurzak favored strategizing before making an attack. While telling Fabia this story, he mentions that she reminds him of Floria. After saving Fabia from being carried away by the water, he has a vision of Floria while being carried away himself. He apologizes for not being able to protect her, but he is glad that he managed to save Fabia.

In addition, she calls the ancient and legendary "antimatter energy" to cover her home world. However, the Emperor of Gundalia uses his Bakugan Dharak to break down the shield to steal and absorb the energy's power. Serena's biggest challenge is to keep Neathia running smooth and keep the people calm and safe while waiting for Fabia and the Brawlers to help take down Barodius. In "Mechtanium Surge", she is revealed to be the Ambassador of Neathia and Gundalia. In order for this to happen, she resigned as Queen, thus giving the throne to Fabia.

He is highly arrogant but also highly intelligent. Barodius and Phantom Dharak have a final showdown with Dan and Drago and in the end, they lost to Dan and Drago. Refusing to admit defeat, Barodius and Phantom Dharak start to take the power of the Sacred Orb only for Code Eve to banish them inside a flip world of Bakugan Interspace, their hatred and desire exposed to the Sacred Orb caused them to mutate into unrecognizable steel-armored forms that soon would be known as Mag Mel and Razenoid, although the Brawlers at first believed that the two had been killed after Dharak absorbed too much of the Sacred Orb's powers. From that point onwards, he kept his desire to take the Gate and Key to control the Mechtogan and Bakugan in existence. He was killed by Dan & Drago in the episode "The Final Takedown".

He is a teacher and trainer of Airzel, who shares a Spectra-Gus relationship with him. This relationship is also shown between him and Barodius, with Barodius in the "Spectra" role and Gill in the "Gus" role (reverse of his relationship with Airzel). It is shown that many times in the series he distrusts Kazarina, and he shares a mutual hatred with her, as well as fighting over Barodius's favor. His Bakugan is Krakix. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss on how powerful Drago truly is. In The Secret Package, he, Airzel, and Kazarina join their brainwashed battlers against the Neathian Castle Knights. In The Element, Gill reports to Emperor Barodius that their Gundalian forces took down the second shield and Neathia's front line. In The Sacred Orb, Gill and Krakix battle against Captain Elright and Raptorix, but as Drago and Dharak come face to face, the Sacred Orb teleports the Twelve Orders back to Gundalia. In Battle For the Second Shield, before Lena leaves for Neathia with Kazarina, Gill tells her to watch her back around Kazarina, for she is loyal to no one but herself and would think of nothing of sacrificing one of her subordinates to save herself. After reporting to Barodius, she runs into Gill, letting him know of Lena's betrayal, suggesting that someone may have told her what she had planned for her. Gill replies that she got lucky today, and that you never know who you can trust.
Chris is a member of Team Sellon. She's a Subterra Brawler.
Dylan appears to be some sort of dealer inside Bakugan Interspace. He is seen licking a blue and yellow striped lollipop. Both the Brawlers and Team Anubias find him quite annoying.

He is seen crying in the preview for episode 43 while hugging Runo this shows just how much he loves his daughter.

Spectra has returned in the fourth season, Bakugan Mechtanium Surge. He was first seen in the shadows receiving a distress call from Marucho who was fighting against the rampaging chaos bakugan, although Marucho and Shun were surprised that Spectra came to help they were still glad. Spectra left afterwards but not before telling Dan that he has changed from the old Dan. Spectra and Helios returned to help the brawlers again when they were fighting against Mag Mel on Gundalia and before they left Spectra said they had nothing left to worry about over the brawlers. When Dan thanked the two of them for helping, Spectra said they could call on him anytime.
This is a list of characters from the Japanese anime series Bakugan Battle Brawlers.
In What's the Plan?, when he and Shun are forced to fight together in a tournament, Ace wears a purple and black mask to disguise himself while tensions rise between the two of them and they fall close to losing. However, on the edge of defeat, they put their differences aside and Ace works together with Shun after realizing he was just trying to help. Shun remarks that he is very much like Dan. In Voices in the Night, after falling for the Vexos trap laid out by Mylene, he loses in battle to her and becomes a hostage. After Marucho and Shun are also captured, they are relocated to Beta City, where they are freed by Mira and Spectra, though they are unaware of this. When he's told that Mira betrayed the Resistance he refused to believe it due to his feelings for her and gets a little violent by grabbing Dan's collar, but accepts it as the truth when Baron insists Dan's telling the truth. In Wall To Wall Brawl, When the Resistance infiltrate Gamma City, he and Dan battle Mira and Gus. Mira ends up betraying Gus and Ace tells her he always believed in her, Mira smiles happily at him and is glad to be back on the resistance.
Alice Gehabich's grandfather and is the one who opened the portal to Vestroia and exposed humans to the different types of Bakugan. Similar to how Alice is Masquerade he has a more negative, evil form, which is Hal-G, and for most of the first series he is seen in this form. He turns into Hal-G when a huge amount of negative energy from the Silent Core infiltrates his lab. He is cured by the end of the first and second season. He is first seen in Moscow with Alice, fixing the gate to New Vestroia. When he tests it by sending a Russian doll, it fails to teleport he tries it with a Gate Card and it teleports. However, unknown to him or Alice, it sent thousands of gate cards into New Vestroia, one which is caught by Spectra and given to Professor Clay. Later Michael used the technology of Lync's gauntlet to fix the gate thus preventing Alice, Runo and Julie from going to New Vestroia along with Dan and Baron, as they did not have gauntlets which were required to be able to enter.
In episode 6, he brawls against Fabia Sheen. He was supposed to battle Dan Kuso but Fabia intervenes and brawls in Dan's place. Fabia was about to win until an error in the arena that Ren created (intended for Dan and Drago) affected Fabia and Aranaut, costing her the win. After Ren was revealed to be the enemy, Jesse left, but even after that, Ren still called Jesse a Neathian.
A brawler who uses Darkus and many different Bakugan types and kept on losing to Dan since episode 1. In the Gundalian Invaders's premiere, Shuji can be seen. His Guardian is Fear Ripper.

The central villain of the third season, and one of the two main villains of the fourth season (alongside Coredegon). The Emperor of Gundalia, leader of the Twelve Orders and also a Darkus Brawler. He was born to a family that has ruled Gundalia for a long time. He is the leader of the Twelve Orders that seek to conquer Neathia. He has been able to rule Gundalia due to his overwhelming strength and special ability to simultaneously execute battles. His sole desires are: to obtain the secret DNA Code from the Bakugan that possess it and create the most powerful Bakugan in the universe. His other goal is to take Neathia's Sacred Orb so he can rule the universe. His Bakugan partner is Dharak. Gill is his longtime childhood friend and most trusted confidant, but when Barodius found out that Gill killed Kazarina, he had Phantom Dharak destroy both Gill, Airzel, Stoica and their Bakugan. His quiet and calm demeanour masks his hot tempered and devious nature.
In New Vestroia, he owns Condo Apartments and is in the condo business shown on Vestal in episode 29, having moved to Vestal to maintain his business there with Sirenoid. He helps Ace beat Mylene also in the episode. After that, he stays in Vestal and doesn't appear in Gundailian Invaders. In the first season, it seems like he has a bit of a crush on Alice.
Member of the Twelve Orders. He's an Aquos Brawler. He has a split personality: one of an angel, the other the devil, which can change in a second, so turning your back on him is a very bad idea. Stoica is usually calm and pompous, but when he is irritated, he will need a lot to calm him down. Stoica has many trick moves during battle and opponents have a hard time reading him. He has saved Gundalia many times with ingenious battling abilities. He is the youngest member of the Twelve Orders. His Bakugan partner is Lythirus. He is the only member of the Twelve Orders to show his human form. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss on how powerful Drago truly is. In The Sacred Orb, Stoica and Lythirius battle Marucho and Akwimos in the water. Just as Drago and Dharak are about to face each other, the Sacred Orb teleports the Twelve Orders back to Gundalia. In The Secret Switch, Stoica and Jesse find Dan, Shun, and Fabia in the jungle, wondering why they are even there in the first place. As Shun flees the scene, Stoica lets Jesse and Plitheon take on Fabia and Aranaut, but loses to them. Anxious and impatient, Stoica and Lythirius enter the battle. As he keeps taunting Dan, Stoica realizes that Dan and Shun switched Drago and Hawktor around. Even with Razoid, Stoica and Jesse both lose to Dan and Fabia. In Curtain Call, as he and Kazarina try to blame each other for loss of the second shield, Stoica suggests they blame Jesse for their mistakes. Unfortunately, Jesse has escaped, so he sends Ren to go retrieve him. After losing to Fabia and Jake, Ren returns to Gundalia with Jesse for Kazarina and Stoica. Just as they are about to dispose of Jesse, Plitheon speaks out of wanting to leave Jesse. However, Lumagrowl and Lythirius subdue Plitheon for turning on his partner. After disposing of Plitheon, Kazarina and Stoica do the same with Jesse. While walking down the hall, planning their report for Barodius, Kazarina and Stoica run into Nurzak, who tells them that they may be able to fool the others, he can see them for who they really are. In Mobile Assault, Gill, Stoica, and Airzel lead a front line of brainwashed battlers against the Neathians. Then, Gill has Stoica go to Earth to recruit more battlers from Earth. In Bakugan Interspace, Stoica and Ren, in their human forms, go to recruit new battlers, but Stoica leaves Ren to do the recruiting, while he goes searching for battlers in Bayview City. He then follows Koji, a battler, and persuades him into coming with him to Gundalia, so Kazarina can brainwash him (Koji having no clue of Stoica's intentions, merely that he was going to get a chance to have a brawl). In Colossus Dharak, Stoica takes on Marucho and Jake, but Gill steps in. In Dragonoid Colossus, Stoica is seen battling against Marucho, with both Lythirius and Akwimos using their Battle Gears. Thanks to Razoid, Stoica and Lythirius beat Marucho and Akwimos. Then, just as Linehalt unleashes his Forbidden Power, the Twelve Orders retreat back to Gundalia. In Redemption, Kazarina and Stoica confront Fabia and Nurzak and engage in battle with them. As Kazarina and Stoica press on the attack with their Battle Gears, the ground under Fabia and Nurzak crumble, with them falling. They then find Fabia and Nurzak to survive their fall, thus continuing their battle. Just as they have got the upper hand, Stoica has Lythirius flood the battlefield, forcing Kazarina, Lena, Zenet, and Jesse (the last three being brainwashed) to retreat. With Fabia and Nurzak to himself, Stoica, now underwater, blasts them, sending Nurzak down the current. In Final Strike, Stoica and Lythirius knock Shun, Hawktor and Fabia to the ground as they are trying to reach Dan's location. Fabia leaves Stoica to Shun. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle the Brawlers to keep them from leaving Gundalia, but are all defeated by Drago's Spire Dragon, all but Kazarina. Just as the Brawlers take their leave, Stoica and Airzel prepare to leave for Neathia, but Stoica stops to wonder where Gill is. Airzel tells him that his "ship was damaged when the Brawlers attacked and said to go on ahead", making Stoica suspicious. In Broken Spell, Stoica and Airzel reach Neathia, keeping Dan and Shun away from Barodius. After Kazarina's spell breaks, Stoica reveals that on the way to his ship, he saw Airzel and Gill talking about Kazarina. Airzel admits to Stoica that it was Gill that killed Kazarina, not Fabia, with Barodius listening in on them, thanks to Stoica's speakerphone being on. In Code Eve, Airzel realizes that Barodius was listening in on his conversation with Stoica, who had his speakerphone on. Stoica and Lythirius attack Dragonoid Colossus with acid bubbles in his eyes, blinding him in the process. But Dharak attacks Dragonoid Colossus with Stoica and Lythirius still on him, killing them all.

He is 15 years old in New Vestroia. He made a cameo appearance in episode 4 when Marucho battled Mylene, but his face was not revealed as his hood covered it completely and was offered a place in the Vexos. After hearing that Skyress was taken captive, he rushed towards one of the cities to save her, but on the way, teamed up with Dan after rescuing him from Spectra and Gus. After being separated from Skyress, he teams up with Ventus Ingram, who he grabbed just before a beam pulled him into the ship. In the beginning, he does not get along with Ace very well, who refers to him as a "ninja-wannabe", but he is deeply admired by Baron who, in episode 7, even tries to imitate some of Shun's ninja moves but fails. He is taken hostage in episode 15, after being defeated by Shadow. Mira and Spectra later free him in episode 20, though he is unaware of this. He is reunited with Storm Skyress in episode 26 but she stays in New Vestroia, claiming that she was in his past and that Ingram is officially his new partner now. In episode 26, he goes back to Earth with Marucho, Dan, Drago, the other brawler's Bakugan, except for Storm Skyress. Shun returns to New Vestroia a few episodes after the beginning of the second series, and has a run-in with Lync Volan of the Vexos.

Shun is still the strong silent type and highly skilled with Bakugan, and is willing to help his friends whenever they need it. He helps Dan defeat the Alternative in the final episode of New Vestroia. Not much has changed for how he acts or looks, except for the fact that he has cut off his ponytail to neck length. His Trap Bakugan is Ventus Hylash and his current Guardian Bakugan is Ventus Master Ingram.

After Shun thinks his mom is dead the doctor says she is just tired which turned out to be true. After Shun's initial relief, he finds a Bakugan in his mother's hand; this turned out to be Skyress, a strong and rare Bakugan. She gave this to Shun because she knew that Shun was interested in Bakugan not in ninja lessons. It is unknown if she is alive. Skyress was given to Shun to look after him since she cannot look after him herself. When Oberus gave Shun his test, she used an illusionary form of a young Shun's Mother who always wanted to play with Shun, the final game she wanted to play with him, was Bakugan.

Member of the Twelve Orders. He's a Ventus Brawler. Emperor Barodius and Gill recruited Airzel to be a warrior, and Airzel continues his battle training with Gill. He lurks in the shadows, to protect Barodius who chose him personally to be part of the 'Twelve Orders'. Airzel is the leading expert in enemy surveillance and information analysis. He always takes matters seriously, which causes him to be annoyed by Stocia's laid-back personality. Airzel is the #1 trainer on the Special Bakugan Team. His Bakugan partner is Strikeflier. He is fierce, confident, and reckless. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss on how powerful Drago truly is.

When the battle gets intense, Marucho and Akwimos trap Strikeflier and Avior in a block of ice, with Marucho and Jake escaping Airzel and Mason. In Mobile Assault, Gill, Stoica, and Airzel lead a front line of brainwashed battlers against the Neathians. In Colossus Dharak, Airzel and Strikeflier battle Shun and Hawktor, but when Fabia intervenes, Kazarina steps in to help Airzel. In Dragonoid Colossus, Airzel and Shun continue their battle, both using Battle Gear. Just as Hawktor takes out Lumagrowl, Strikeflier sneaks up on him and Shun and finish them off.

Gill and Airzel begin to battle Marucho and Shun, who have fallen for their trap. When Gill is prepared to take on Hawktor, he finishes off Airzel, but Gill defeats both Marucho and Shun. Before Gill and Airzel can take them away, Shun throws down a smoke ball, letting Shun and Marucho escape. In Final Strike, Airzel takes on Marucho as the Brawlers make their way to Dan. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle the Brawlers to keep them from leaving Gundalia, but are all defeated by Drago's Spire Dragon, all but Kazarina.

In Broken Spell, Stoica and Airzel reach Neathia, keeping Dan and Shun away from Barodius. After Kazarina's spell breaks, Stoica reveals that on the way to his ship, he saw Airzel and Gill talking about Kazarina. Airzel admits to Stoica that it was Gill that killed Kazarina, not Fabia, with Barodius listening in on them, thanks to Stoica's speakerphone being on. In Code Eve, Airzel realizes that Barodius was listening in on his conversation with Stoica, who had his speakerphone on. Just as Dharak prepares to attack Gill, Airzel and Strikeflier fly to his ship to protect him, but are killed along with Gill by Dharak's attack.

The former Emperor of Gundalia. Barodius disliked him for fearing the powers of the Sacred Orb and also called him a "superstitious old fool" for this.

After the destruction of the BT System, Dan and the Brawlers find out, with Lync Volan's help, that King Zenoheld is constructing a machine called the Alternative Weapon System which could destroy both Earth and Vestal. Dan along with the rest of resistance attempt to stop the alternative through any means necessary. At the end of New Vestroia he destroys the alternative weapon system with the help of his friends and allies. It is shown that he has been dating Runo at the start of the season. In Gundalian Invaders, Dan, Marucho, Shun, Jake, and Ren join Fabia in fighting an oncoming invasion of the evil Gundalians who want to rule over Neathia and have control over the Sacred Orb. In Mechtanium Surge, he and Drago have problem controlling their new powers they were given to by Code eve, and can sometime be taken over by Mag Mel and Razenoid and spawn Zenthon, a Mechtogan, which they eventually tame while in New Vestroia, after they returned to New Vestroia to control their new powers. They were the number one in bakugan Interspace until they were disqualified for using Zenthon accidentally, when battling Anubias for number one position. Dan later regained the title of Leader of the Brawlers after he apologized to the rest of the Brawlers minus Spectra.
Mira Clay (known in the Japanese version as Mira Ferumin (ミラ・フェルミン, Mira Ferumin)) is a 16-year-old Vestal girl who had formed the Bakugan Brawler Resistance and became a leader of it after witnessing the tortured Alpha Hydranoid speak out in vengeance to the invaders, to free all the captured Bakugan from Prince Hydron and the Vexos. At the end of Surprise Visitor, she along with Baron travel with Dan back to his world. In Unmasked, Mira challenges Spectra to a battle and if she's victorious, Spectra will be unmasked. If she loses, however, she has to join the Vexos and even battle against her own friends. She told herself in the beginning that her hero was always her brother, Keith, but forced herself to change her mind about it after Spectra unmasks himself in front of her, revealing that he was her 'hero'. Baron described her as 'intense'. She betrays the Brawlers in Family Ties as she says that she wants to stay with Keith, once telling the others on Earth that Spectra is her brother. She returns to New Vestroia through the portal Apollonir opened with Spectra, Gus and Lync after revealing her betrayal. In Beta City Blues, she reveals that she has joined the Vexos, but is really wondering what Spectra is up to. In Brotherly Love she challenged her elder brother to a battle and if she wins, she goes back to being with her real brother and not Spectra. However, if she loses, she will have no choice but to work for and obey Spectra. She later lost the brawl. She is regretful of this as she says, "I'm sorry, my friends" after the battle, and is also seen crying as she has no choice but to be an enemy to the Resistance that she herself had founded. She later returns to the Resistance which was her main plan. She returns to Vestal with Ace and Baron and their Bakugan, in case the Vexos will want to take back New Vestroia for themselves in the future. Mira visits the Brawlers on Earth for a visit, but soon returns to Vestal, this time with Dan and Marucho, and they meet up with Ace and Baron at Klaus Von Hertzen's estate. Following the defeat of Zenoheld she returns to Vestal with her older brother, Gus, and the rest of the Vestal Resistance. She also has a brother that she desperately wants to find after he disappeared during Hydranoid's rebellion. Although she is the leader, she has a small tendency to go off on her own. She prefers the Subterra attribute. Her main Bakugan is Subterra Wilda and her Trap Bakugan is Baliton. She is good friends with Julie and Runo. It was also the main reason for Ace's hostility to Dan because Ace has a romantic crush on Mira. Mira is a strong fierce leader and very caring about everyone. she also always wishes that her brother keith would return and her wish came true. Mira returns in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge where she helps the brawlers by creating powered battle suits for their Bakugan. She is among those killed by Mechtavius Destroyer near the end of the season when he destroys Bakugan City, but her death is prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho are able to go back in time and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer before he could attack Bakugan City.

Joseph "Joe" Brown (known in the Japanese version as Osamu Jo (城 治, Jō Osamu)), also known as Webmaster Joe (ウェブマスター・ジョウ, Uebumasutā Jō). In the first season, it was revealed that due to an unknown health condition, he basically lived in a hospital for some time. During this time, the Brawlers thought that he was working for Masquerade, because somehow, Masquerade knew every location they set foot, although this was because Alice was a Battle Brawler, so she knew where they were. After Dan confronted him, he told Dan that he would only tell him the truth if Dan could beat him in a battle. In the middle of the battle, Joe fainted, and when he awoke he revealed that the brawlers' theory was untrue and he actually sent a message to all of the Bakugan players around the world to warn them that Masquerade was plotting against them. After the truth was revealed, they asked him if he wanted to become a Battle Brawler, which he gladly accepted. He then revealed that he and his mother were going on a road trip for the time being, to see the world outside of the hospital. Sometime later, after he moved to the Brawlers' neighborhood, he found Wavern, who had the Infinity Core hidden inside of her. It was also revealed that Wavern was Naga's twin sister and that he was looking for her in order to absorb the infinity core. After he obtained Wavern, Joe was the first person to beat Masquerade in a one-on-one battle.

After Sid, Lena, Jesse and Zenet were punished by the Twelve Orders, Ren feels incredibly guilty over what has happened, especially since he has gotten off Scot free each time. While he was fighting with Dan, he was surprised to see that Sid is alive and is relieved to hear from him that the others are alive as well. Sid saves Ren from Dharak's attack and falls to his death, not before giving Ren his Rubanoid. After some serious thought and battling with Dan, Ren decides to turn on Barodius and do something he should have done a long time ago: fight alongside his true friends. At first, the Neathians do not accept him, but after battling Fabia, where he lost, Fabia offers him her hand and he goes with the Brawlers. He is now one of the Castle Knights.After the war is over Ren returns to Gundalia along with his teammates and Nurzak.
Soon after Mylene and Volt come back from brawling, he sees a transmission from Spectra, saying that the Vexos, Hydron and Zenoheld himself were responsible for the mess in the previous season. This causes him to send Shadow Prove to seek out Dan and the others so that he will get the Attribute Energies first. But when he does, he realizes Spectra jammed the transporting system, making it impossible to travel to Vestal and back. This infuriates him, knowing that he is up to something. Eventually, though, Shadow goes to Earth and brawls Chan Lee and Alice (who do not have any Attribute Energies). He wins and proves himself to Zenoheld. He also brawled against Gus Grav, and won with the Farbros-Assail formation, and destroyed Blast Elico, and his Bakugan Trap Hexados. However, Gus and Vulcan survived the final blow.
Baron Leltoy (known in the Japanese version as Baron Rich (バロン・リッチ, Baron Ricchi)). Originally, Baron fought with Tigrerra, but lost her to Spectra Phantom and Pyrus Helios. He used Haos Nemus as his main Bakugan and uses Piercian as his Trap Bakugan. In Surprise Visitor, he says that he had always wondered what it would be like on the other side of the portal, which was the portal that led Runo to New Vestroia from Earth. In the end, he decides to follow Dan, Mira, and Runo to Earth in order to stop the Vexos from destroying it. Baron admires Runo as one of the six original Battle Brawlers but Runo's father does not like the fact that he does. He returns to New Vestroia with Dan through Dr. Gehabich's dimension transporter. He seems to be very fond of the activities done on Earth, especially by Dan e.g. taking baths. In Beta City Blues, he and Dan made it back to New Vestroia where they battled Mylene and Shadow in Beta City. Baron was defeated helping Dan and Drago, but he still was able to keep Nemus. He returns to Vestal with Ace and Mira with their Bakugan, in case the Vexos will want to take back New Vestroia for themselves in the future.

Jake Vallory (ジェイク・ヴァレリ, Jeiku Vareri) is a new friend of Dan's after his arrival at his new town. He has a powerful presence, because he's big for his age. He's very calm, but can get overly excited and obsessive. He is a Subterra brawler and his Bakugan partner is Coredem. He is just starting out as a brawler and still was asked to join the Bakugan Battle Brawlers. He really admires Dan and likes to use his name and rhymes it with other words like, " Dan the Man with the big, brown van." which sometimes irritates Dan. Later on when the brawlers are on Neathia Jake gets kidnapped and brainwashed but as of episodes 34 it looks like Jake is coming back to his senses. But in Dream Escape he has a dream where Dan is shouting his name and it is then that he comes back to his senses and goes back to Neathia with the others.
Spectra Phantom (スペクトラ・ファントム, Supekutora Fantomu). At the beginning of the series, Spectra Phantom would only serve under and obey Prince Hydron. Little was known about Spectra, but it confirmed he is very powerful and thinks highly of his skills as a Pyrus brawler. He was the Vexos' strongest battler and used Pyrus Viper Helios as his main Bakugan and Metalfencer as his Trap Bakugan. After seeing Drago's powers, Spectra said that he's not going to let it be a 'play thing', which means that even when he captures Drago, he will not give him to Prince Hydron. In What's the Plan?, Mira noticed a possibility that Spectra could be Mira's brother. How he became Spectra is unknown. He also wished to join forces with Dan and the Resistance so they could take Prince Hydron down together in an attempt to rule New Vestroia and Vestal. After Gus lost to Mira, Spectra unmasks himself, proving himself as Mira's older brother Keith Clay (Keith Fermin (キース・フェルミン, Kīsu Ferumin) in the Japanese version). When he, Gus and Lync traveled to Earth, Mylene took over as leader. Meanwhile, Spectra won the Bakugan brawl against Dan and Drago, and takes Drago. Dan defeats him and a corrupted Drago during their brawl with the help of Pyrus Apollonir. In episode 19, he convinced Mira to join him. He needed her help on his "ultimate plan", which was creating a Cyber Helios and duplicating the power of the Perfect Core, planning to use this Bakugan to overthrow the Vestal royal family. In Brotherly Love he battled Mira and won with his new Cyborg Helios. In episode 24 he took several Mechanical Bakugan for his own purpose of making Maxus Helios to defeat Dan. He does not return to Vestal, but he remains in the other rim of the planets area in a ship with Gus, Helios, Elico, Vulcan, and Brontes.

In the second half of New Vestroia, he flees Vestal and resides in his palace on the outer skirts of the galaxy that is remote from civilization. He is revealed to be a brawler and he sends a message to the Six Ancient Warriors to surrender their Attribute Energies to him so that Professor Clay can power up the Bakugan Termination System.

In Partners 'Til the End, Gill and Ren planned on going to Neathia to take down the second shield, but Zenet disguised herself as Ren to redeem herself. But when Krakix thumped Ren (Zenet) on the head, she morphed back to her normal self. As she begged for a second chance, Gill allowed her to accompany him on this mission. Krakix took out the Castle Knights guarding the second shield. Then, Gill had Krakix scan the shield so they could destroy it on a molecular level. But when Shun and Hawktor swooped down on them, Gill had Zenet delay him while Krakix scanned the shield. But as Contestir was about to shoot down Hawktor, he tricked him and Zenet into hitting Krakix. Gill jumped in and as he was about to finish Shun and Hawktor, Dan and Drago arrived on the scene just in time. With the combined teamwork between Dan and Shun, Gill and Zenet lost and retreated. Because of the Brawlers' interference, they were only able to transfer 76% of data from the shield. Just as Gill was about to punish Zenet, Contest spoke up for her and suggested to Gill that he should have someone loyal only to him, to keep an eye on the other members of the Twelve Orders, and volunteered Zenet for the role. Convinced, Gill decides to try it out, so he has Zenet disguise herself as Nurzak to spy on Kazarina for him. Zenet reports back to Gill with information on Kazarina and Nurzak plotting to overthrow Barodius. Despite their excellent job, Gill and Krakix dispose of Zenet and Contestir, as they saw no further use for them.

In All Or Nothing, Spectra transports Dan to his ship upon reaching Earth to retrieve the Perfect Core from Drago. During their battle, Spectra seems to have a change of heart, referring to Dan as his friend in thanks for enlightening him. He reveals shortly that using data on Bakugan evolution, he plans to bring out even further power from within the Bakugan. After they arrive at the Mother Palace, he states that the Resistance is on their own in shutting down the BT system. After confronting Zenoheld however, Gus is defeated and Spectra soon forms a temporary alliance with Dan to avenge his fallen comrade. After the Pyrus attribute energy is absorbed and the BT system begins to activate, his ship is used to transport all of the bakugan on New Vestroia to Earth. When time begins to run out, and the Resistance decides to bail out while they still can, Helios leaves Spectra and confronts Drago about staying to evacuate the remaining bakugan. The two decide to head off and destroy the BT system, and after Drago evolves by absorbing the attribute energies, Helios and Spectra once again become Dan and Drago's rivals before leaving New Vestroia. But in the end of Spectra's Last Stand, Spectra agrees to join Dan and the Resistance and takes off his mask, becoming Keith once again.

Hal-G is a man with green skin and white hair who was the alter-ego of Alice's grandfather Michael after he was exposed to the Silent Core just like Alice, who became Masquerade. He assisted Naga in his quest to get the Infinity Core from Wayvern. After Naga was destroyed, Hal-G was exposed to the Infinity Core and returned to being Michael.
Akira is Shuji's younger brother and Nene's older brother. For most of the series, he is by Shuji's side but much later he brawls Dan and Runo alongside Shuji and Nene. He uses Subterra and his Guardian is a Centipoid.
Team Anubias is a Bakugan team in Bakugan Interspace led by Anubias (who is under Mag Mel's orders). So far, only 4 members were seen and it seems like Team Anubias is composed of only male Brawlers. Their goal is to be Number One in Bakugan Interspace, which they have already done.
He is currently mentioned by Dan in the season 3's introduction (first fourteen episodes), and also appeared in the next video game, Defenders of the Core (along with Spectra and the other Vexos, excepted Hydron and Clay).

Alice Gehabich (アリス・ゲーハビッチ, Arisu Gēhabicchi) (also knownasMasquerade) is a 14-year-old girl from Moscow, Russia. Although she knows almost everything about the game, she rarely plays it; she is generally afraid of hurting others, including Bakugan. She usually just gives advice to the other brawlers, which she prefers over battling. Alice is kind and caring, worried forand compassionate towards others and does not think of herself. She also adores Shun. Alice was sometimes unconsciously possessed by"Masquerade" (her mysterious alter-ego), and with a sudden jolt, her auburn hair spikes up and turns into a golden blonde as well as becomes slightly shorter and straighter, and clothes and a mask come out of nowhere on her, and finally, she turns into a male. This was caused by her exposure to the Silent Core. Alice might seem to be less important than the other brawlers, but in fact she plays an important part, not as Masquerade, but without her, the brawlers might have already lost her to her alter ego. Michael Gehabich is her grandfather; who she constantly worries about after finding out that his alter-ego is the monstrous Hal-G and that he works for Naga. Alice and Marucho are the 2 brawlers who mostly use strategy. However, unlike Marucho, Alice gives her strategies to the other brawlers. She left the Brawlers after finding out that she was Masquerade out of intense guilt over what she had done as him, as well as fearing the Battle Brawlers will have a deep grudge against her,but later returns in time to save Dan in the form of Masquerade. Her guardian is Alpha Hydranoid, which she received from Masquerade after he bid her farewell and left her body (something she initially resents, because she believed that she needed him; although Masquerade's presence will always be in her, as he is capable of communicating to her through her mind. Alice is also shown once with Masquerade's shadow instead of her own). After that, she initially begins to battle more, with her Darkus attribute, which she inherited from Masquerade. She either has a crush on Shun or Lync. Alice is 17 years old in New Vestroia, 18 years old in Gundalian Invaders, and 19 years old in Mechtanium Surge. Alice has a special ability that most brawlers wish to have, she can see the power level of any bakugan on the field even if the bakugan is not playing.That is why she does not have a baku-pod. She might have this ability because of Masquerade. She ultimately ends up at 2nd place at the end of the series. It is still unknown if Alice is an orphan. She appears in Surprise Visitor and takes in Lync in Gate Crashers. In New Vestroia it is stated after Alice is reunited with Hydranoid, that she hates brawling because of what happened in the past, but when Shadow attacks in Shadow Attack, she has no choice but to fight back with help from Chan Lee. She and her grandfather also manage to find the route to the Mother Palace in All For One.
Fabia Sheen (ファビア・シーン, Fabia Shīn) is the Princess of Neathia. She is the younger sister of Serena Sheen, the former Neathian Queen. Fabia's reason for brawling is to save her planet from the Gundalians. She is also the fiancée of the former Captain of the Castle Knights, Jin, who is deceased.
Runo Misaki (美咲 琉乃, Misaki Runo), is a 12-year-old (11 in the Japanese dub) girl who loves playing Bakugan against skilled people so she can show off. Runo is a Haos brawler. Her Guardian Bakugan is a Haos Tigrerra (the others being Terrowclaw and Saurus), who is very obedient and powerful in battle. Tigrerra later evolves into Haos Blade Tigrerra. Though underage (in the first season), she helps her parents run their family business in a cafe. It is revealed in episode 5, it is she lives not too far from Dan. In episode 32, a flashback revealed that she knew Dan from when she was little, but didn't realize it because she didn't catch his name. It is heavily hinted that she has feelings for Dan (and vice versa) but no relationship forms. She reached 6th in the rankings. She has not brawled for the final showdown against King Zenoheld as Tigrerra chose not to brawl and put her into trouble. She missed her friends so much that she teleported herself to New Vestroia but she was half way there. She's believed to be 16 years old in the third season's timeline. Even though she didn't appear in Gundalian Invaders as an individual, in True Colors, she was shown in a flashback from New Vestroia, and in Mobile Assault, she was shown in a picture with Dan. In Mechtanium Surge, she was shown in another picture with Julie in the episode Back in Sync. However, she finally made her return in the episode Enemy Allies, where she delivers the battle suits to Dan, Marucho and Shun as they battle Wiseman. From that episode on, she and Mira helped to deliver the Battle Suits to the Brawlers whenever they needed them. In Jump to Victory, she met a Baku Sky Raider named "Haos Aerogan" and became his new partner, but Aerogan later returned to New Vestroia. Runo is a fairly good opponent in Bakugan. Near the end of Mechtanium Surge, Runo, along with Julie and Mira, are killed when Mechtavius Destroyer annihilates Bakugan City, but their deaths are prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho, are able to use the Current of Time to go back to before that happened and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer for good, preventing that dark future.
Their first appearance is in episode 7, where they challenged Anubias but were both defeated easily by Horridian and his BakuNano Aeroblaze. Mag Mel is watching them and decides to make them a part of his army and gives them 2 Flash Ingrams. Later, Shun and Marucho watch them destroy an unknown team with their new BakuNano mercilessly. Later, they both battle Marucho and Trister and they were defeating them. However, Shun intervenes and they battle him. At first, they are winning due to their BakuNano but are defeated ultimately by Shun.

He has a good relationship with his parents. His mom is a big yoga fan, while his dad is obsessed about pudding and has a personality similar to Dan's, only he's a little more clueless. It is possible that Dan plays guitar; in earlier episodes you can see a Fender Telecaster in the corner of his bedroom. In season 3, Dan has moved to Bayview Town because of his dad's work, and quickly becomes popular due to the fact he helped destroy Naga and King Zenoheld.
Gus was the Vexos' second strongest player, a Subterra brawler and devoted all his free time to training. He used Subterra Primo Vulcan as his main Bakugan and Hexados as his Trap Bakugan. He only answers to Spectra. He is said to be a weasel throughout the series, and "Spectra's little pet" and "Spectra's lapdog" by the other members of the Vexos, like Mylene[2] and Lync.[3] He was shown to be fond of the different things on Earth such as 'juice in boxes', but the planet made him uncomfortable. In episode 5, it was shown that before he joined the Vexos, he battled Spectra in the finals of the Bakugan Battle Tournament and lost. He was then offered a place in the Vexos by Spectra, where he gladly accepted. He admired Spectra a great deal and he felt that Spectra must be respected at all cost. He was shown to hate Lync because of his cheekiness. When the Vestal Palace was self-destructing, he gathered Elico and Brontes who were thrown into the ship chamber and saved Spectra and Cyborg Helios. He did not return to Vestal, but he lived with Spectra in the ship. Gus later was challenged by Volt to a battle, but won with Brontes. After the battle, he returned to Spectra, but not before tossing Brontes through the teleporter back to New Vestroia. In Avenging Spectra, Gus took King Zenoheld hostage and then battled him but when he used his attack Aquos Blast Elico (formerly used by Maylene) sacrificed himself for Gus then later in the battle Hexados sacrificed himself for Subterra Rex Vulcan then both Gus and Rex Vulcan fall defeated in battle. Since then, Spectra had vowed to avenge him. Gus was thought to have died until 10 episodes later, when it was later revealed that he survived and was placed in a cell, though how he survived was not explained. He later escaped and helped Spectra battle Zenoheld who was trying to stop Zenoheld's new weapon. Gus later made a comeback in Mechtanium Surge, though he only appeared in Episodes 25 and 26, where he teamed up with Spectra to defeat Mag Mel's Chaos Bakugan.
Julie Makimoto (known in the Japanese version as Julie Heyward (ジュリィ・ヘイワード, Jurī Heiwādo) is a 12-year-old girl from Las Vegas, United States, who tries to stay happy even when the worst has happened (for example, when Billy ended up under the control of Masquerade); she acts happy after something bad happened but she generally does that just to cover up her true feelings inside. Julie forgets things easily, proving that she is a little scatterbrained at times. In the Japanese version, Julie spices her speech with American phrases, differentiating her personality from the others. She adores Dan, and by "adore", we mean "make out adore". This is why she's jealous of Runo, but eventually gets over Dan and becomes best friends with Runo. Instead, in episode 47, called, "Here's Mud In Your Eye", after defeating Tricloid, Julie realized she likes Billy Gilbert, her childhood friend, while Billy feels the same way with her (which is true, due to the fact that she and Billy were blushing at each other a little throughout the 47th episode), and of course, when she asks Billy out, he said, "Okay...".She is a Subterra battler and her guardian Bakugan is her Subterra Gorem. Gorem then evolves into Subterra Hammer Gorem. Julie has a sister named Daisy who has bested her in everything since she was a child. She reached 8th in the rankings. She chose not to brawl against Zenoheld in the final showdown as Gorem did not want to put her into trouble. She returns in Gundalian Invaders as a neighbor of Dan's once he moves. She works at a cafe and in Revelation, it is revealed she is a cheerleader for the team Jake plays for. This strongly suggests she is already in high school in her first year with Dan. She's believed to be about 16 years old. In Brawler To Be, Jake is having his first battle and Jake gets scared, so Julie teaches Jake some lessons. Her role is basically that of a supporting character. Julie returns in Mechtanium Surge as a news reporter. Near the end of that season, Julie is killed alongside Runo and Mira when Mechtavius Destroyer levels Bakugan City, but her death is prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho use the Current of Time to go back and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer for good, before he could carry out his murderous intent.
Rafe (known in the Japanese version as Ralph Waver (ラルフ・ウェイバー, Rarufu Weibā)) is a new character in Bakugan: Mechantium Surge. He is a Neathian Castle Knight who was sent by Princess Fabia to go to Earth to help the Brawlers with the Mechtogan threat. He is the new Haos Brawler of the Battle Brawlers.Since the Battle Brawlers helped save Neathia during the war against Emperor Barodius Rafe, along with other members of the Castle Knights, have looked up to Dan and the Brawlers.Rafe was disappointed when he and Paige discovered how much the Brawlers had changed with Dan and Drago gone but he never gave up believing in the Battle Brawlers. After Mag Mel's defeat Rafe and Wolfurio returned to Neathia.
She appeared in the manga The Evo Tournament. It is unknown what her main Attribute is. Her Guardian Bakugan is Chamelia, but it was sent to the Doom Dimension. Her new Guardian became Mecha Chamelia, a mechanical Bakugan built by her father. She develops a relationship with Marucho over the internet at which point Shun reveals he knew her before meeting the others. He had helped her practice for a match and offered to lend some of his abilities if he beat her in a battle. She lost and never spoke to him again and later stole his ability cards.
Member of the Twelve Orders. She's a Haos Brawler. She is sly as she is cold-hearted and is always by Emperor Barodius' side. She works as the Director of the Bakugan Biological Research Center, where she secretly undergoes cruel living body experiments to heighten the abilities of Bakugan. Her goal is to develop abilities that will rival the Neathians. She is an exceptional scientist who has unraveled the mysteries of Bakugan evolution. She can also hypnotize others to do her bidding, as shown with Jake and Coredem. She is heartless and selfish, as she would sacrifice one of her own subordinates to use as a scapegoat without losing any sleep on it. Another example of her cruelty was shown in a battle before the series began, when she killed a number of Neathian soldiers, including the previous commander of the Castle Knights and Fabia's fiancé Jin before capturing Aranaut and sadistically experimenting on him. Her Bakugan partner is Lumagrowl. Kazarina is killed by Gill in the middle of Broken Spell and her spell on everybody is broken. When Lumagrowl hears about Kazarina's death, he leaves in sadness. His final, mournful howl over her death is heard echoing.
A wanna-be brawler who sought power to become the strongest brawler. In episode 3, Masquerade promised to give him such power using the Doom card. In brawler battle, he lost to Dan and his creatures. He's also another cliché villain that acts mysteriously.
Their first appearance is in episode 5, where Mag Mel decides to give these two boys Chaos Bakugan (Cyclone Percivals) and are brainwashed into doing his bidding after they are defeated by Anubias. They soon challenge the Brawlers, but instead of the entire members of the Brawlers showing up, Shun and Marucho decide to take them on without Dan's help. The Tri-Twisters use some underhanded tactics making it seem like the Brawlers didn't have a chance. It is soon shown that the Tri-Twisters had thrown down a third Cyclone Percival into the battlefield, as it was attacking Taylean invisibly. Soon afterwards, they are easily defeated by Sellon and Anubias (after interrupting the battle).
In Ultimate Weapon, he battled Spectra, who rammed into his palace. During the entire battle he was losing, even with Assail Farbros, because later Gus joined Spectra. However, when Farbros combined with the Alternative, he overpowered both of them.
Lena Isis is an Aquos brawler from Gundalia. She is partnered with Aquos Phosphos and his Battle Gear is Terrorcrest. She is an intelligent, strategic brawler and is calm, and collective in a battle. She is also clever and does not suffer from arrogance like her teammates. She first appears in "Revelation" alongside Sid Arcale against Dan and Marucho, but both lose to Drago because of his Level 2 Battle Gear. In "Confrontation", she and Mason manage to recruit some top-ranked brawlers by using their non-Guardian Bakugan and lose, thus proving they are powerful brawlers. They then bring the two kids back to Gundalia, in which Kazarina hypnotizes them. In "Escape From Darkness", she and Zenet battle Fabia and Avatar Marucho. Lena was clever enough to realize that Marucho's Aranaut was a digital clone, but did not realize that Marucho was an avatar, not until Ren put his and Marucho's conversation on the arena's big screen, letting Lena and Zenet that they are battling a clone. After that, Lena and Zenet defeat the Avatar Marucho and Fabia. They then try to take Fabia back to Gundalia, but escape Bakugan Interspace when Marucho arrives. In "The Sacred Orb", Ren, Lena, Zenet, Mason, and Jesse, in their true forms, were being talked down to by the Twelve Orders. Before heading for Neathia in "Battle For the Second Shield", Lena is warned by Gill to watch her back around Kazarina, for she is loyal to no one but herself and would think nothing of sacrificing one of her subordinates to save herself. Once on Neathia, she, alongside Kazarina, battle against Shun and Drago, but lose when Dan and Hawktor arrive. After retreating back to Gundalia, Lena and Phosphos attempt to ambush Kazarina, knowing she would sell her out to save herself, but her plan fails when Lumagrowl takes down Phosphos and Kazarina finishes her off. She is then seen unconscious in "Sid Returns", along with Sid, Zenet, and Jesse. In "Redemption", Ren and Mason sneak into Kazarina's Lab to rescue Lena, Zenet, and Jesse, but find that no one is inside. As she is battling against Fabia and Nurzak, Kazarina reveals a surprise to them: Lena, Zenet, and Jesse, all hypnotized. But once Stoica has Lythirius flood the battlefield, Kazarina has Lumagrowl retreat, along with Lena, Zenet, and Jesse. In "Dream Escape" and "Gundalian Showdown", Emperor Barodius brings Zenet, Jesse, and Lena with him as he invades Neathia and has them fight the Castle Knights. In "Broken Spell", they fight against the Brawlers just as they return to Neathia. But when Gill kills Kazarina, her spell is broken and Lena, Zenet, and Jesse are finally free. After the Brawlers fill them in on everything that has happened up until now, they decide to join them and fight against the Emperor. In "Code Eve", Ren and his teammates prepare for their attack on the Emperor. But their plan fails as Phosphos is strucken down by Phantom Dharak.
The villains in the second videogame, Battle Trainer. They drive a space ship called the Dark Star and stole all Bakugan from Earth, and also deleted Dan's memory. This alien group is led by Vector (Professor Trecov); and his pals Rurock, Viper and Mantis. They wanted to create the most powerful Bakugan with the silent core, but after their defeat, they escaped but not before claiming vengeance on Dan. After the game's ending, it is revealed that the Regulars were working for Naga.
At the beginning of the first video game, Hal-G said that he had the Silent Core and all Bakugan would bow to him. At nearly the end of the game, Hal-G reappeared after the player defeated Marduk at the Tournament a second time, showing the Silent Core to them, but stolen by Marduk's Bakugan Vladitor.

They are guards that the former King Zenoheld and Professor Clay had at the Vexos Motherpalace. They are first seen in episode 27. In episode 40, they chased Dan Kuso and Mira Clay while they sneaked into the Motherpalace. Other guards appear different in the Vestal cities. One of them has the same voice actor as the intercom that says "Field, Open!" in Interspace. Many personal was protecting the three cities.
He wants Shun to be a ninja, not a Bakugan player. Shun lives with him. His house resembles a dojo and has many traps installed inside. He seems to want Shun to be a ninja, as he was once a greatly skilled ninja. Shun came to live with him after his mother had to stay at the hospital after being ill. He is very fussy at times. Shun does go out with him in regular times though, as seen where he shows his grandfather through the city. In the English dub, he is stated to be 85 years old.

Professor Clay Fermin is Mira and Keith's father who created the first Mechanical Bakugan named Ventus Altair for Lync in Cyber Nightmare. He also appeared in Facing Ace with Alpha Hydranoid. He also created Darkus Hades and Trap Darkus Fortress for Shadow. Professor Clay is also credited for making the Cyber Bakugan that were intended for Prince Hydron but are being reprogramed for Spectra by Lync. He also turns Pyrus Helios into Pyrus Cyborg Helios after Helios gave him the idea of a Cyborg Bakugan. He also oversaw the test run of his creation Farbros in King Zenoheld's battle with the six Ancient Warriors. Besides Altair, Cyborg Helios, and Farbros, other examples of Professor Clay's Mechanical Bakugan creations are Aquos Brachium, Darkus Fortress, Subterra Dryoid, Dynamo, Fencer, Foxbat, Grafias, Grakus Hound, Hades, Klawgor, Leefram, Macubass, Metalfencer, Scraper, Spindle, Spitarm, Spyderfencer, and Wired. He also designed the Bakugan Termination System and is currently developing the Alternative Weapon system for King Zenoheld. As of Ultimate Weapon, he has finished the Alternative Weapon system (which he based on Farbros). In Final Fury, he was killed along with Hydron & Zenoheld when the Alternative System was destroyed, while he was watching the video sent by Fabia about the Bakugan at war.
Volt is a Haos attribute brawler. He used Haos Brontes as his Guardian Bakugan and Haos Dynamo as a Trap Bakugan. He and Lync Volan are the Vexos' tag team champions, although they do not get along well together. He gets defeated by Dan in Invasion of the Vestals, and then again in episode 9 by Ace and Shun in the Bakugan Battle Tournament. He defeats Marucho in episode 14. He is defeated by Baron in Wall To Wall Brawl, and in Ultimate Bakugan is shown with Mylene and Shadow as they hatched an escape plan. In Final Countdown, his Haos Brontes was thrown out by Mylene, together with her Aquos Elico, as she thinks that Bakugan with feelings are useless. Although he was furious, he still left without Brontes, proving Mira's theory that he is brainless. He later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. He makes his reappearance in Spectra Rises, at first challenging Dan and the brawlers still in possession of Elemental Energies, but backs when Spectra appears, and Gus taunts him by saying he stole Brontes' soul. It is shown Volt seems to believe in doing the honorable thing, saying, "I won't kick a man when he's down," after Dan defeats Spectra, and seemingly weakened by the battle. Later, Volt challenges Gus to a brawl to win Brontes back, revealing his mechanical Bakugan Haos Boriates. However, he is defeated by Gus. In Samurai Showdown, Volt challenges Shun for the Ventus attribute energy. But Volt is defeated by the combined efforts of Shun and Baron. In Volt's Revolt Volt does not agree with King Zenoheld's plan to destroy all living things that stand up against him and returns home showing some of his past to the audience in the process. He is shortly thereafter confronted and challenged by Prince Hydron, Volt wins the ensuing Brawl then starts to leave not before scarring Hydron by telling Boriates to nearly crush him. As payback, Hydron throws a grenade in front of Volt, which opens a dimensional port beneath him, sending him into a far dimension. As Volt sinks into the portal, he vows that Hydron will get what's coming to him for all the suffering he has caused innocent people. Volt later appears in Hydron's dreams/hallucinations along with Lync in An Heir To Spare. His fate is unknown.

In Divide and Conquer, Gill informs Barodius of Nurzak and Kazarina's plot against him. As Gill volunteered to do away with these traitors, Barodius told him otherwise and that this information does not leave his room. Furious at Kazarina, Gill vows to take her down, one way or another. In Mobile Assault Dharak suggests that they keep the Neathians busy with a wave of attacks of brainwashed battlers. He, Stoica, and Airzel lead the attack against the Neathians. With 72% of Gundalian forces down, Gill orders the first battalion to fall back and the second to prepare to attack. He then asks Kazarina to resupply him with more battlers from Earth, so she has Ren go do it, and Gill has Stoica tag along with him. In Colossus Dharak, as Stoica battles Marucho and Jake, Gill steps in for support. In Dragonoid Colossus, Gill and Jake battle each other, both using their Battle Gear, but Krakix's Vicer proves to be stronger. When Linehalt unleashes his Forbidden Power, the Twelve Orders retreat back to Neathia. In Into the Storm, Gill and Krakix defeat the Castle Knights and attack the third shield, but the third shield has a DNA barrier, preventing Gundalians from passing through the shield. He then retreats back to Gundalia and reports his findings back to Emperor Barodius. In Infiltrated, Barodius orders Gill and Airzel to separate Dan from Marucho and Shun. Gill and Airzel begin to battle Marucho and Shun, who have fallen for their trap. When Gill is prepared to take on Shun, he surprises him by finishing off Airzel, but Gill defeats both Marucho and Shun. Before Gill and Airzel can take them away, Shun throws down a smoke ball, letting Shun and Marucho escape. In Final Strike, Kazarina informs Barodius that Drago's DNA can be spliced with Dharak's DNA so Dharak can evolve, which Gill protests against, for risking their greatest weapon, the Emperor's weapon, is too great a risk. But Emperor Barodius orders him to stand down. After Dharak evolves, Barodius promotes Kazarina to his #2, infuriating a demoted Gill. Barodius then orders him to come with him. After the Brawlers break into the castle, Barodius has Gill take care of them while he heads to Neathia with Lena, Zenet, and Jesse (who are brainwashed). Once in the castle, the Brawlers run into Gill. Krakix attacks them before they can even launch their Bakugan, leaving them vulnerable. Fortunately, Ren and Linehalt counter Gill's attack before it hits the Brawlers. The Brawlers then leave Gill to Ren.
In Dream Escape, Ren leaves the battle to join Dan, Fabia, and Jake, but Gill follows him as well. As the Twelve Orders reunite, they prepare to attack the Brawlers. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle against the Brawlers. Just as it seems that Gill has defeated Drago, he comes out unscratched. Drago defeats him with Spire Dragon, as well as Stoica and Airzel, but not Kazarina. After the Brawlers leave for Neathia, Gill orders Stoica and Airzel to follow them. He did not go because "his ship was damaged by the Brawlers". In Broken Spell, Kazarina, looking for her sword, finds Gill, holding her sword. Gill says they need to talk about things, but Kazarina just scolds him to stay in his place. Then Gill, using Kazarina's sword, kills Kazarina, telling her to watch what she says, for words have consequences. In Code Eve, Gill and Krakix, having spotted Fabia, Nurzak, and Mason, try to keep them from returning to Neathia, but they escape on Nurzak's ship. Just as he makes it to Neathia, Gill apologizes to Emperor Barodius for being late and tells him that Kazarina was taken down in battle by Fabia. But Barodius knows it was he who finished off Kazarina. For his betrayal, Barodius has Phantom Dharak attack Gill, along with Airzel and Strikeflier, who try to protect him, but are all killed.
Ren Krawler (レン・クロウラー, Ren Kurōrā) is a 16-year-old Darkus Brawler. Ren was the leader of a secret agent group sent to Earth by Emperor Barodius to find the DNA Code. He is an alien disguised as a human sent to find the best brawlers and defeat the Neathians. Ren comes from the underground world of Gundalia where he was kept, unknowingly, by the Emperor's family due to his possession of a dark Bakugan with a powerful ability.He is a member of the Twelve Orders because he thinks that would save his people if he works for them.He is attempting to trick the brawlers into thinking that the Neathians are the ones trying to conquer Gundalia. His Bakugan partner is Linehalt. He makes an appearance at the end of the final episode of New Vestroia. In A New Beginning it was revealed that he helped put Bakugan Interspace online. He has a battle with Dan, which ends up as a draw. In Confrontation Ren shows too much care and loyalty to his home planet. It's possible that even if Ren and Marucho are current enemies, they still share a big friendship thread. It also seems Ren does not want to fight the brawlers because he still remembers their friendship.
Mylene is the only female in the Vexos. She did not trust Spectra and enjoys doing things her way, but is still a loyal member of the Vexos. She becomes the leader of the Vexos after Spectra and Gus travel to Earth. However, King Zenoheld later became the ruler of the Vexos. Mylene used Aquos Elico as her main Bakugan, and Aquos Tripod Theta as her Trap Bakugan. She defeated Ace in episode 13. She enjoyed the power of being the leader of the Vexos and, like Spectra, is tired of Prince Hydron bossing her around all the time. She also gets annoyed easily by Shadow Prove, who will not stop following her everywhere she goes. In episode 20 she and Shadow Prove battled Dan and Baron in Beta City and were defeated when Drago unleashed the power of the Perfect Core. She escapes New Vestroia with Volt, Shadow, and Lync, saying that it could be destroyed by the battle between Spectra and Dan and their Bakugan, discarding her guardian Bakugan together with Volt's Haos Brontes, as she thinks that Bakugan with feelings are useless. She later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. She later duels Ace in order to obtain Percival's Darkus Energy wielding Aquos Macubass, but was defeated by Ace and Klaus. She than went to Earth with Lync to draw out the brawlers. They found Runo and Mira and battle them. Mylene defeats both Runo and Mira, thus gaining the Subterra energy. She later goes on to defeat Shun and Baron alongside Volt, taking the Ventus energy. After Zenoheld's announcement to create the Alternate Weapons System that would destroy both Vestal and Earth, she appears when Volt was about to leave, warning him about his idea. When he leaves, she wishes him luck, and appears saddened when she hears what happened. In episode 48, Mylene is ordered by Zenoheld to retrieve the Brawlers Battle Gear data and DNA code for the Alternative Weapons system. She is then lured into Bakugan Interspace with Shadow Prove by Keith and Mira, and is forced to battle. She no longer serves Zenoheld and has named herself a free agent. She loses to Mira and her mechanical Bakugan is destroyed. In the end, she rejects the Brawlers' offer to join them and instead throws a dimensional grenade at Keith and Mira. But after the grenade activated, Bakugan Interspace shut down, trapping her, Shadow Prove, Keith, and Mira inside. Marucho made a connection to bring them back, so Mira told Mylene and Shadow to come, but Mylene refuses to go. Mylene than got pull by the dimensional pull until Mira and Keith grabbed her hand, but accidentally let go her as Mira and Keith were teleported and Shadow grabbed Mylene's hand as they both were pulled in the dimensional portal. Her fate is unknown.

In Episode 14, he makes a small appearance along with all of Ren's crew getting chewed out because the brawlers have joined Neathia.
Dan's mother. Her usual past times are watching TV and doing yoga. She appears to be a typical stay-at-home mom, always doing the cooking and cleaning. At the beginning of the series, Miyoko became concerned about her son's latest hobby. She found out about Bakugan when she was cleaning Dan's room. Mrs. Kuso found a Bakugan ball on a table, dropped it and it turned out to be a Pyrus Griffon. She soon feared something was going on when Dan gave her a frog keychain for her birthday only to not come home afterward and asks Runo and even Masquerade. When Dan comes back, she and the rest of the brawlers parents were inform of what was going on and let him go to Vestroia with the others to stop Naga. In New Vestroia, Dan calls her in episode 12 when he returns to Earth. In episode 14 when Dan comes into the house she goes over to hug him only to be greeted by Baron, who she called a sweetie. She then gets Mira to join her in doing some yoga, which Mira apparently did not like. Mira said, "Is this some Earth torture?" She continues to appear until Dan goes back to New Vestroia. She allows him to go, though she gets a bit worried about him once he leaves. She also appears in the first episode of Gundalian Invaders.

She is considered the goddess-guardian of her "Earth"s core, and the one responsible to alter the Bakugan Interspace to take the Player to her reality. Spectra is after her for the whole game to power-up Maxus Helios. The only one who can see her is the player of the game. She is the alternate "Earth's" Core. She seems to get power from landmarks and holograms. Also, she grows weaker as landmarks are destroyed and vexos crystals are made. She is eventually killed during the battle at the Earth's core. Ironically, the player was forced to destroy her because Maxus Helios was becoming too powerful because she was basically a power source. Throughout the story, she evolves your bakugan.
Hydron was the commander of the Vexos, the Vestal Prince and Zenoheld's son. He tried collecting all six of the fighting Bakugan that saved Vestroia and keep them as trophies. The Vexos continually failed to bring him Drago, the last of the six fighting Bakugan needed in his collection, as he had already in possession of Gorem, Preyas, Tigrerra, Skyress, and Hydranoid in a petrified statue form. He is shown to have a habit of twirling his hair between his fingers. In episode 17, he may have been aware that Spectra had Drago in his hands. At the end of the first half of the series, he flees New Vestroia with Mylene, Volt, Lync, Shadow and Professor Clay. He attempted to kill Spectra due to Spectra's betrayal but failed due to Spectra's own determination for power. He lost the six fighting Bakugan to the Resistance in Reunion. In Revenge of the Vexos, he started brawling with Subterra Bakugan, using Dryoid when he is sent to obtain the Haos Energy from Baron's Mega Nemus, and succeeded. In Elfin On the Run, he teams up with Shadow Prove to try to obtain the Aquos Energy from Marucho and Aquos Minx Elfin and succeed in defeating Elfin, but lost to Preyas. Later, he battles Dan and Spectra at the Mother Palace, but loses to Helios and his new Battle Gear. In Volt's Revolt, after Volt leaves the Vexos, Zenoheld orders Hydron to deal with Volt. Volt defeats Hydron in a brawl, but Hydron starts to go insane and throws a dimensional grenade at Volt to send him to another dimension. He is almost pulled in with Volt, but escapes in the nick of time. In Payback, when Lync copies the plans for the Vexos' new Alternative Weapon system, Hydron follows Lync and defeats him in a brawl. He then throws another dimensional grenade at Lync to send him to the same dimension as Volt. When he returns, he is looking for his father's approval, but Zenoheld ignores Hydron blaming him for his minions' failures. This causes Hydron to face his father. When he does, he loses and is put in a cell across from a shadowed figure, which is possibly Gus from the figure's blue hair. In the next episode, it did turn out to be Gus, and they had a brief conversation before the opening. Gus later tricks Hydron, after a string of dog-related insults on Gus's part, into brawling with him. This breaks the doors on the cells releasing both. Before flying off, Gus says that he could have asked Hydron nicely but that would probably not work only further angering Hydron. He is later seen making his own, escape attempt on Dryoid. He makes it to the ship with the other Bakugan Brawlers. They forgive him and he is presumed that he was killed after ensuring that his father will not escape the blast from the ALternative's destruction. His last words were "Volt, Lync, I'll be there soon." The blast occurred right after, so it is believed that he is dead.
