In a 2002 article from the Baton Rouge Advocate, drummer Travis McNabb said of the band's decision to use the song in a commercial: "They called us and said they wanted to use it in an ad....We were like, 'Is it gonna be Ronald McDonald running around chasing the Hamburglar or something?' But when we found out the concept of the ad, it sounded like a good fit. Ultimately, it's just more exposure for the music and for the band. We've gotten a great response from it. It's funny, though, how in the past five to seven years everyone's view of that sort of thing has changed. It used to be that any kind of sponsorship would be harshly judged by music fans and critics."

The following is the track list of singles from Extraordinary You: Original Soundtrack.
In Moo Ryuyee's July Found by Chance universe, the "Stage" and "Shadow" (originally "Heads" and "Tails") are the two alternating phases of the comic world.In the Stage, the Writer takes full control of the comic world as the scenes that are planned in the comic's "Storyboard" play out. Everything that happens and anything the characters say or do are all done as willed by the Writer, thus nothing happens in the Stage unless it is intended by the Writer.In the Shadow, the comic world is temporarily detached from the Writer's control. All characters can move or act freely while spaces or objects that exist in the comic world but are not yet drawn by the Writer act strangely (e.g. floating, moving in reverse). Those who have gained self-awareness (e.g. Dan-oh, Jinmichae) can remember events from the Shadow.

Not satisfied with this fate, Dan-oh decides to forge her own destiny by changing the story's plot and finding her own true love. Her hopes of freeing herself from the Writer's control becomes stronger than before when she unexpectedly meets nameless Student Number 13 (Rowoon). But as the events around Dan-oh and Number 13, whom she named as Haru, gradually start to have parallels with the Writer's previous work Neungsohwa,[d] changing her destiny could have a price to pay.

The series follows high school girl Eun Dan-oh (Kim Hye-yoon) who is a student at a prestigious academy. One day, by chance, she discovers that the world she lives in is a fantasy world of comics. She and everyone else are merely characters in a comic book entitled Secret,[c] all under the authority of their omnipotent and omniscient Writer.

The Guardian said that "there's a lot going on in the recent single Extraordinary – steel drums, pizzicato strings, rumbling timpani, cut-up vocal samples, chattering electronics – but you'd never notice, partly because the production is so polite and anaemic that it saps the constant musical shifts of their power, and partly because it's all buried underneath another rotten song, this time a kind of uplifting Emile Sandé-esque ballad: the result is about as extraordinary as branch of Tesco Express".[4]

The EP contained the track "Homage To Young Men," a spoken-word piece written and performed by Alastair McIntosh. McIntosh was inspired to write this piece after working with Concannon and performed live twice with the band. The band have likened Alastair's performances to "..the howlings of a wild animal". McIntosh is well known for his contributions to the Scottish version of 'Thought for the Day' and has been dubbed "The Rapping Reverend".[citation needed]

They also performed at Glastonbury Festival and the Secret Garden Party festivals in 2015.
The duo grew up in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England[2] and attended Trinity Catholic School together.[3] They formed a band and named it after a Hungarian girl on whom Concannon had a crush at school.[4] They started out performing throughout England, building a small but loyal fan base. Future musical artist and performer Ed Sheeran was their guitar technician at many of their early shows and has stated they were a major influence on his musical style, favouring an acoustic guitar to more lush efforts.[5]

The duo also appeared at 'Lainfest'[16] in August 2013 and 'Barn on the Farm' in July 2013.[17]
The second album, titled "Make It Happen," was released on 31 March 2008. The album was recorded with producer Phil Brown who had formerly produced artists such as Bob Marley. The album was recorded on 2-inch tape, a traditional style of recording said to create a more 'raw' sound that is popular with musicians preceding the era of digital recording technology. The album included guest appearances by Martyn Barker (percussion/drums), Andy Simms (piano), Jonnie Fielding (violin), Jack Hobbs (vocal/scratching), Rory Simmons (trumpet), Kadially Kouyaté (kora & Senegalese vocals), Rory McLeod (harmonica), The Individuals Dedicated to the Ministry of Christ choir and a contribution by the poet Benjamin Zephaniah.[7]
An EP containing six songs and titled ExtraOrdinary, was released on 4 September 2006. The six tracks included two that had been released before — "Helen" and "Yesterday" - which were previously released on the "JCB" and "Girls" EPs respectively. The record is an attempt to strip down the orchestral production of their early work to represent the duo's vibrant live sound.[citation needed]

Their follow-up single, "Girls," was released on 3 April 2006. The band have described the song's music video on radio interviews as "Tim Burton-esque." Karni & Saul of Flynn Productions directed the video, which was the first video in which the band appeared.Like "JCB", it was first released on the Internet. Limited radio play meant the song did not chart in the UK top 40.[citation needed]

In 2007, they received an Impala Platinum award recognizing sales of the album in Europe.It was produced by Gavin Monaghan, also known for his work with Scott Matthews and Robert Plant.

It reached number one on 18 December 2005, selling more than double the copies of their closest competitor, Westlife. It eventually won the duo an Impala Platinum award recognizing sales of over 500,000 copies of the song across Europe in 2007.[6] Dermot O'Leary gave the track extensive airplay on his BBC Radio 2 show. Some bookmakers put it in the running for Christmas number one but the winner of The X Factor, Shayne Ward's début single, "That's My Goal" won that honour.[citation needed] The music video received widespread airplay, mainly on the VH1 music television channel. The video was an animation,[5] made by Laith Bahrani (aka Monkeehub) who also animated an unofficial video for an acoustic version of "Creep" by Radiohead.[citation needed]

The song garnered mixed reviews from music critics, who were dissatisfied with her attempt to go mainstream. Slate's Mim Udovitch said that Phair sounds "bogus,"[8] while PopMatters called the song "sickeningly effervescent."[9] Some critics were more complimentary towards the song, however. Chuck Klosterman, writing for Spin, praised the song's "authenticity,"[10] while AllMusic noted that it was one of its parent album's highlights.[11] Michael Paoletta of Billboard called the song "ultra-catchy" and "oh-so-buoyant".[12]

"Extraordinary" was written by Phair and the production team the Matrix. The song was inspired by feelings Phair experienced of wanting to be seen for who she really is. Phair explained: "I feel like in my life I've always struggled against being kind of the girl-next-door to people, and always wanting people to see me as maybe having more depth."[1]

"Extraordinary" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Mandy Moore. It was released as the first single from her fourth studio album, Wild Hope (2007). The song was written by Moore, Deb Talan, and Steve Tannen and produced by John Algia. "Extraordinary" is a indie rhythmic folk pop, with arrangment of acoustic guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitar.[1]
Moore performed the song live for the first time at the official first televised ceremony of the Brick Awards on The CW, though she has also performed the song at a number of smaller gigs.[2] Billboard magazine said that "Moore's once-girlish vocals now project a richer, more purposeful texture, well-suited to the autobiographical theme...".[3]

The music video of "Extraordinary" was directed by Ace Norton.[5] The music video featured green screen footage of Moore as different characters, including a hippie chick, a rocker chick, a '50s housewife and Amelia Earhart. The characters are hanging on and standing upon each other with some holding on to different objects. "She's kind of the hero," Moore explained. "She's the Mandy that makes the move to jump off the tower and be extraordinary." The music video was shot in Los Angeles, despite being filmed inside the studio with the city setting.[6] It entered the VH1's Top 20 Video Countdown chart at number twelve.
The song peaked at number 2 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 and number 25 on the Adult Top 40 chart. As of July 2012, "Extraordinary" has sold 287,000 paid digital downloads in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[4]
