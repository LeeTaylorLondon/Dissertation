Melville de Mellow worked with the All India Radio from April 1950 to April 1971 and belonged to the ‘staff artistes’ category. Following his superannuation he was retained as Producer (Emeritus) for another five years with AIR.[7] De Mellow is remembered as an iconic broadcaster noted for his deep baritoned commentary of various events in independent India.[1][8] In 1948 he accompanied the cortège bearing Mahatma Gandhi's body from Birla House to the cremation venue at Raj Ghat giving a seven-hour-long commentary of the event from an All India Radio van. Melville de Mellow's moving commentary that day, articulating the nation's grief and homage as the cortege moved towards Raj Ghat, is remembered as one of the best instances of radio broadcasting in India.[9] His commentary that day inspired veteran Hindi commentator Jasdev Singh, then a seventeen-year-old, to take up commentary as a profession. Singh has since been conferred with a Padma Shri and a Padma Bhushan for his services to radio broadcasting.[10][11] In 1952 Melville de Mellow was handpicked by the British Government for broadcasting a running commentary on Queen Elizabeth’s coronation procession.[8] He was also the commentator at India's Republic Day parade for several years and his commentary of India-Pakistan hockey matches are remembered to this day.[12] His reportage on the Bangladesh War and its subsequent liberation by Indian forces were keenly awaited by listeners of the radio.[13]
Melville de Mellow (also de Mello) (1913 - 1989) was an Indian radio broadcaster with the All India Radio. He is remembered for his high-quality reports and commentary on various events in independent India, the most notable of which was a seven-hour broadcast of Mahatma Gandhi's funeral in Delhi.[1] He was conferred the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1963 in recognition of his services to broadcasting.[2]

In his review on Allmusic, Michael G. Nastos states "Not all mellow, Houston Person's tribute to the softer side of jazz has its moments based on the laid-back timbre of his soul rather than a program consisting of only ballads. The tenor sax he wields certainly reflects the tradition established by Ben Webster in its soul-drenched tone, but is not as vocally pronounced or vibrato-driven. ... That's not to say this marvelous tenor saxophonist has depreciated his talent as an adept technician, but at this point in his career he prefers this music on the mellow side, and has no problem staying interested in that mood, no matter the tempo".[3] On All About Jazz, Andrew Velez noted "Houston Person's Mellow could easily have been called "Up Close and Personal." With dozens and dozens of recordings to his credit, it's just the latest in a long list of exemplary sets that always evidence the warmth of his tone and the directness of his tenor sax phrasing. Also mixed in as well is a funky R&B feeling".[4]
