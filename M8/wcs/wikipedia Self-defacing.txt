Give us more. Or maybe the Criticisms section should be removed? OhWhyNot (talk) 02:41, 9 May 2015 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I believe you are misrepresenting Wikipedia:NOTDICDEF. A dictionary entry is no more prescriptive than a mathematics entry that explains the limits of a theorem's applicability: so the article would still be descriptive. Second, the subject of this article is still the actual humor, not about the correct word for it. But I learned recently that self-deprecating outnumbers self-depreciating 50:1. Self-depreciating is still more correct--and deserves mention--but self-deprecating seems to have permanently invaded on the other's meaning.—Preceding unsigned comment added by 97.116.0.248 (talk) 22:28, 24 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
So there are nations that are do not value self deprecation? Which ones? You should have a source since you claim certain nations i.e. only examples given are European when you have civilizations that have been around for 4-5 000 years and surely must have been somewhat modest (Chinese, Indian, Persian, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, etc.The irony is, when you claim certain nations are excessively modest, you are contradicting yourself by 'blowing their trumpet' for them when they in fact trying to avoid this and that is the whole point.— Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.79.143.139 (talk) 01:22, 19 May 2015 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Self-deprecating humor purports to be self critical, but sometimes the "negative" that is pointed out is not so negative. For example "oh, my skin is so white I can't get a tan", in a culture where whiteness is generally seen to confer status is an example of self-deprecating humor that is not (to borrow a term from above) self-depreciating. 71.190.66.244 (talk) 19:10, 24 April 2010 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Can we remove "or – better –" because it seems unsubstantiated and just like someone's preference. Blackladyv (talk) 03:01, 19 February 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Somebody has unilaterally merged the articles Self-deprecation and Self-hatred improperly, without following the standard Wikipedia WP:MERGE protocol for open discussion before a proposed merge. The Self-deprecation article appears to have been truncated and stuffed into a sub-subsection of the Self-hatred article.
Self-deprecation is often perceived as being a characteristic of certain nations, such as Great Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, where "blowing one's own trumpet" is frowned upon.
As self-deprecation does not seem to simply be a form of comedy, perhaps it would be productive to split the pages as this subject amasses more content, adding a header similar to the one on the Hmannan Yazawin page. E.G. "This article is about the comedy technique. See Self-deprecation (Psychology) for an article about the general psychological term."I am not at all an expert in comedy, so I will leave the details to such experts.98.81.1.151 (talk) 00:42, 19 August 2013 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Both are basically synonymous, the former being simply a $20 word and the latter one in a 5-cent-word. For example, many discussions of the "self-hating Jew" stereotype use the term "self-deprecation". Of course, one may split hairs and say that self-deprecation is an external expression of self-hatred, but the essence is the same. Staszek Lem (talk) 01:32, 14 December 2017 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Cyberbot II has detected that page contains external links that have either been globally or locally blacklisted.Links tend to be blacklisted because they have a history of being spammed, or are highly innappropriate for Wikipedia.This, however, doesn't necessarily mean it's spam, or not a good link.If the link is a good link, you may wish to request whitelisting by going to the request page for whitelisting.If you feel the link being caught by the blacklist is a false positive, or no longer needed on the blacklist, you may request the regex be removed or altered at the blacklist request page.If the link is blacklisted globally and you feel the above applies you may request to whitelist it using the before mentioned request page, or request it's removal, or alteration, at the request page on meta.When requesting whitelisting, be sure to supply the link to be whitelisted and wrap the link in nowiki tags.The whitelisting process can take its time so once a request has been filled out, you may set the invisible parameter on the tag to true.Please be aware that the bot will replace removed tags, and will remove misplaced tags regularly.

Based on the definitions of these words, self-deprecating should be the mental condition since it means "self-hate" and self-depreciating should be the type of humor in which you belittle yourself. Historical usage also confirms this. Until the late 19th century self-depreciating was the standard form. dictionary.com actually has a usage note that explains the mistaken origins of self-deprecation. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia should adhere to the most correct English, even if common usage had distorted the meaning of self-deprecation.—Preceding unsigned comment added by 97.116.0.248 (talk) 18:52, 16 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Someone changed this article to "self depreciation".I see now it has been (rightfully) changed back.But to clear this up for anyone who may have had any doubts, I want to reiterate: Self deprecation is the common term.The only Google results I could find for self "depreciation" are about some kind of psychological condition, and a few message board posts where people apparently meant to type "deprecation".See also the Google Fight link for this.71.35.143.8 (talk) 15:29, 23 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
The person who changed it to self-depreciation was correct. First consider the meaning of deprecate and depreciate.deprecate:1.	to express earnest disapproval of.2.	to urge reasons against; protest against (a scheme, purpose, etc.).3.	to depreciate; belittle.4.	Archaic. to pray for deliverance from.

In the media: What should Wikipedia do? Publish Russian propaganda? Be less woke? Cover the Holocaust in Poland differently?
Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.
I have worked on articles about various specialized exhibitions, such as Mathematica: A World of Numbers... and Beyond, Mathemalchemy, both New York World's Fairs, the Empire State Plaza architecture and Art Collection, Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology, Museum of Printing, New York Transit Museum, and specialized New York City exhibits at the Queens Museum. I have worked on the MIT Museum, Exploratorium, American Museum of Natural History, Harvard Art Museums, Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East, Yale University Art Gallery, Rose Art Museum, Rhode Island School of Design Museum, and numerous other art museums and science/technology centers. I work on architectural articles, such as the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Kresge Auditorium, MIT Chapel, Infinite Corridor, Building 20, and Technology Square; and architects, such as Harry Weese, Benjamin Thompson, Minoru Yamasaki, Paul Rudolph, and Gordon Bunshaft. I expanded the Thomas J. Watson Library article, adding mention of the Nolen Library as well.
All this is rooted in Time, to be or not to be, to be happy or not to be happy.
Avoid numerical date formats such as "03/04/2005" (this could refer to 3 April or March 4—who knows?).
I am interested in cultural phenomena and artifacts, such as Sidewalk art, Graffiti, Street art, Juicy Salif, and the German Volksempfänger. I have worked on articles about various subcultures, such as Urban exploration, the Hacker ethic, and Hackerspaces.
I also have edited the WP:Manual of Style and various Wikipedia help files and tutorials when I identify common editing issues and errors, or realize that I can make powerful and helpful tools more accessible to all editors, from newbies to experts.
I connect many articles via Wikilinks, which I consider to be an important feature of Wikipedia. I crosslinked the articles on the artist Gustave Courbet and geological Karst springs. I have connected the article on Salvador Dalí to the article on the Willis Tower in Chicago, via the article on Glass floors. I have corrected a serious technical error in the article Evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles, Wikilinking it to relevant articles on Mechanical impedance and Transformers. I have created or significantly expanded navbar templates, which are helpful in exploring a large set of related articles, such as Template:HVAC, Template:Plumbing, Template:Toilets, Template:Fire protection, Template:Caves, Template:Nightclub fires, and Template:Road types.

In which over two-thirds of the featured articles section needs to be copied over to WikiProject Military History's newsletter
I have done some very modest editing of the French Wikipedia, crosslinking and importing material to/from the English Wikipedia. I have worked on English Wikipedia articles related to the French language, such as List of French expressions in English, verb framing, Quebec French, Quebec French profanity, and French cultural artifacts such as Asterix. I occasionally import material from the German, Italian, Spanish, or other language Wikipedias, but don't edit them much because I am not sufficiently fluent in those languages.
I edit a very eclectic and wide array of Wikipedia articles, including those on a number of women artists, such as Niki de Saint Phalle, Marisol Escobar, Isabelle Collin Dufresne, Louise Bourgeois, Yayoi Kusama, Nancy Reddin Kienholz, Remedios Varo, Lucia Moholy, Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, Sarah Sze, Muriel Cooper, Felice Frankel, Taylor Davis, Laura McPhee, Rosamond W. Purcell, and Jacqueline Casey. I have also done work on male artists such as Jean-Robert Ipousteguy, Eadweard Muybridge, Ed Kienholz, Paul Delvaux, Thomas Eakins, Maxfield Parrish, Daniel Chester French, Cyrus Dallin, László Moholy-Nagy, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Calder, Richard Estes, Duane Hanson, Ron Mueck, Miguel Ortiz Berrocal, Charles Eames, Russel Wright, Isamu Noguchi, Otto Piene, Michael Leunig, James Turrell, Jamie Wyeth, Wen-Ying Tsai, Paul Matisse, Doug Fitch, and Jeff Lieberman (artist engineer). I've also worked on musical artists and related creators, such as Michael Tilson-Thomas, Johannes Brahms, Dmitri Shostakovich, Alan Hovhaness, Teddy Abrams, Jacob Collier, and Phil Spector.

Don't link dates or date-fragments unless there's a very good reason to do so (however, date- and year-themed articles themselves, such as January 3 and 1981, are an exception to this).
I have worked on a number of mostly technical articles, such as Gender of connectors and fasteners, Coaxial power connector, Abundance of the chemical elements, Cooling tower, Piping and plumbing fitting, Knob-and-tube wiring, and Central vacuum cleaner. I have contributed to articles about the history of computing technology, such as Harvard Mark I, TX-0, ASCII, Punched tape, DECtape, Flip Chip (PDP module), Multics,Incompatible Timesharing System, DECSYSTEM-20, PDP-11, RSX-11, RT-11, ASR33, VT100, Tektronix 4010, Heathkit, and Monrobot XI.
What should Wikipedia do? Publish Russian propaganda? Be less woke? Cover the Holocaust in Poland differently?
I enjoy discovering and documenting connections (both shallow and deep) among superficially disparate topics.
I have added new "Cultural references" sections to articles about mathematical phenomena and artists, connecting mathematics, science, technology, and art. For example, I added a brief section to the article Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage, linking to a new monumental sculpture in the Netherlands which incorporates the linkage. I overhauled the article on Infinity mirrors, including adding a new "Cultural references" section referring Yayoi Kusama, Josiah McElheny, Ivan Navarro, and Taylor Davis as visual artists who have made use of the phenomenon. I have also added a “Cultural references” section to the article on Trolley pole describing some literary connections to Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and James Agee, and added an interesting historical sidelight to the article on Platform gap. I have added some further literary sidelights to the articles Typewriter and IBM Selectric typewriter, as well as extensive technical and historic information.
I have done work on Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the less-known but far more effective pioneering electrical engineer, as well as his flashier contemporary Nikola Tesla. Other interesting engineers include Bob Pease, Bob Widlar, Bob Dobkin, Jim Williams, Henry Kloss, Richard Stallman, Tim Berners-Lee, Steve Wozniak, Barbara Liskov, Dave Cutler, Chuck Hoberman, John G. Trump, Hal Laning, Margaret Hamilton, Limor Fried, and Charles Babbage. I have worked on scientists and educators, such as George Gamow, Victor Weisskopf, Richard Feynman, Mary Roach, Moon Duchin, Randall Munroe, Erik Demaine, Philip Morrison, John Ochsendorf, Fernando J. Corbató, James Burke, Edward R. Tufte, Frank Oppenheimer, Norm Abram, Gunther von Hagens, Doc Edgerton, and Leo Beranek. I have also worked on the tragic story of the MIT student Philip Gale, and the much happier stories of Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the MIT Science Fiction Society, and Traditions and student activities at MIT.
Today's motto...→ I'm gonna take this night and make it Evergreen.
I have worked on biographies of assorted other interesting people, such as Joyce Chen (chef), Jules Verne, Elbridge Gerry, Dmitri Borgmann, Piet Hein, Eve Babitz, Agnes Varda, and Mike Jittlov.
I have edited numerous articles related to transportation and infrastructure, both around Boston and worldwide, such as Tunnel, Rapid transit, Slurry wall, Turnstile, Erie Canal, Escalator, Paternoster lift, Utility tunnel, and Gas lighting. I have worked on articles related to health and safety, including Mothball, Airbag, Seat belt, Underride guard, Gas leak, Escape chute, Exit sign, Stray voltage, Laboratory safety, Beryllium, Mercury (element), Electrical outlet tester, and List of civilian radiation accidents.
In the future, I hope to work on articles about Jean Tinguely, Anish Kapoor, George Rickey, Claes Oldenburg, John F Pile, some overlooked women photographers, and some pioneering audio engineers such as Roy Allison and Barry Blesser.
I have worked on Mathematics and art, Anamorphosis, Piphilology, and Mnemonics. I have worked on articles about the development of various abstract symbols, including the Infinity symbol, the Recycling symbol, the Valknut, and the Looped square.
Recent research: "Wikipedia's Intentional Distortion of the Holocaust" in Poland and "self-focus bias" in coverage of global events
Here are some shortcuts to pages I find personally handy at the moment (not necessarily recommending them to anyone else):
I am also interested in Educational toys, including Erector Set, Meccano, Anchor Stone Blocks, Girder and Panel building sets, Fischertechnik, Minivac 601, Digi-Comp II, Things of Science, Useless machine, and the infamous Gilbert U-238 Atomic Energy Laboratory. I have worked on the stories of A. C. Gilbert, Friedrich Fröbel, Seymour Papert, and other educational innovators.
"Wikipedia's Intentional Distortion of the Holocaust" in Poland and "self-focus bias" in coverage of global events
I am interested in connections between technology and art, including Neon art, Kinetic art, Light art, Surrealism, Op Art, and Fore-edge paintings. I am interested in scientific phenomena and devices such as Dust explosions, Fulgurites, Lichtenberg figures, Fire pistons, Stirling engines, Euler's Disk, Tippe tops, Rattlebacks, and Plasma globes. I have worked on materials, such as Silicone, Rust, and Vantablack, as well as Conservation and restoration of plastic objects. I am interested in processes, such as Spirit duplicator, Mimeograph, and Laser printing.
Featured content: In which over two-thirds of the featured articles section needs to be copied over to WikiProject Military History's newsletter
I have worked on a number of articles about individual artworks, such as the Tarot Garden, Cloud Gate, Sean Collier Memorial, Fearless Girl, Kendall Band, Appeal to the Great Spirit, Bacchante and Infant Faun, Vessel, and The Sphere.

The term "self-hatred" is used infrequently by psychologists and psychiatrists, who would usually describe people who hate themselves as "people with low self-esteem".[1] Self-hatred, self-guilt and shame are important factors in some or many mental disorders, especially disorders that involve a perceived defect of oneself (e.g. body dysmorphic disorder). Self-hatred is also a symptom of many personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder,[2] as well as mood disorders like depression. It can also be linked to guilt for someone's own actions that they view as wrongful, e.g., survivor guilt.[citation needed]

Racial stereotyping of African-Americans and negative American media portrayals of Black men and women have spread outside of the U.S., influencing people of all races worldwide, and increasing self-hatred.[3][4][5]
Theodor Lessing, in his book, Jewish Self-Hatred (1930), identified this as a pathology, “a manifestation of an over identification with the dominant culture and internalization of its prejudices.” There have been studies from sources stated in the scholarly research, “mental illness in Jews often derived from feelings of inferiority and self-hatred resulting from persecution and their subordinate position in society.”[citation needed]

The term has been used to label American Jews accused of hiding their identity “by converting or intermarrying and raising their children in another faith” to overcome sociopolitical barriers due to antisemitism in the United States.[9]
Self-hating or "anti-Catholic Catholics" are terms of critique by traditionalist or conservative Catholics to describe modernist or liberal Catholics, especially those who seek to reform doctrine, make secularist critiques of the Catholic Church, or place secular principles above Church teachings.[6][7][8]

The legitimacy of the term (in modern usage) remains controversial. According to the transdenominational Jewish platform My Jewish Learning: "Some scholars have claimed that by labeling another Jew self-hating, the accuser is claiming his or her own Judaism as normative–and implying that the Judaism of the accused is flawed or incorrect, based on a metric of the accuser's own stances, religious beliefs, or political opinions. By arguing with the label, then, the accused is rejecting what has been defined as normative Judaism. The term “self-hating” thus places the person or object labeled outside the boundaries of the discourse–and outside the boundaries of the community."[40] Haaretz writes that the term is almost exclusively used today by the Jewish right against the Jewish left, and that within left-wing and liberal circles, is "usually considered a joke".[41] Richard Forer, writing for The Huffington Post, rejects the legitimacy of the term as it is commonly used, calling them so divisive that they make tolerance and cooperation impossible, eradicating the possibility for genuine understanding. Forer writes: "The notion that any Jew who is dedicated to justice for all people harbors self-hatred defies common sense. Given the self-esteem it takes to stand for justice amidst fierce denunciation, a more accurate assessment is that these are self-loving Jews."[42]

The historian Bernard Lewis described Jewish self-hatredas a neurotic reaction to the impact of anti-semitism by Jews accepting, expressing, and even exaggerating, the basic assumptions of the antisemite.[13]
Even Commentary, the Jewish journal which had once been "considered the venue of self-hating Jews with questionable commitments to the Zionist project",[18] came under the editorship of Norman Podhoretz to staunchly support Israel.[18] In his 2006 essay "Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism", Alvin H. Rosenfeld takes "a hard look at Jewish authors" whose statements go well beyond "legitimate criticism of Israel," and considers rhetoric that calls into question Israel's "right to continued existence" to be antisemitic. The use of the concept of self-hatred in Jewish debates about Israel has grown more frequent and more intense in the US and the UK, with the issue particularly widely debated in 2007, leading to the creation of the British Independent Jewish Voices.[8] The Forward reported that the group was formed by "about 130 generally leftist Jews."[19] It was the Rosenfeld essay, which did not use the term Jewish self-hatred, that led to the 2007 debate. Critics claimed the charge of antisemitism implied Jewish self-hatred to those criticizing Israel. Rosenfeld responded that such claims were "disingenuous" and for some a "dialectical scam validating themselves as intellectual martyrs."[4] The New York Times reported that the essay spotlighted the issue of when "legitimate criticism of Israel ends and antisemitic statements begin."[20]
The Austrian-Jewish journalist Anton Kuh argued in a 1921 book Juden und Deutsche (Jews and Germans) that the concept of "Jewish anti-semitism" was unhelpful, and should be replaced with the term "Jewish self-hatred", but it was not until the 1930 publication of the German-Jewish anti-Nazi philosopher Theodor Lessing's book Der Jüdische Selbsthass (Jewish Self-hatred) that the term gained widespread currency.[2] Lessing's book "supposedly charts Lessing's journey from Jewish self-hater to Zionist."[8] In it he analyses the writings of Jews such as Otto Weininger and Arthur Trebitsch who expressed hatred for their own Judaism. Lessing was assassinated by Nazi agents shortly after Hitler came to power.

He was referring to "philanthropic Zionists", assimilated Jews who might wish to remain in their home countries while at the same time encouraging the Jewish proletariat (particularly the poorer Eastern Jews) to emigrate; yet did not support Herzl's political project for a Jewish state.[2] Ironically, Herzl was soon complaining that his "polemical term"[2] was often being applied to him, for example by Karl Kraus.[2] "Assimilationists and anti-Zionists accused Zionists of being self-haters, for promoting the idea of the strong Jew using rhetoric close to that of the Anti-Semites; Zionists accused their opponents of being self-haters, for promoting the image of the Jew that would perpetuate his inferior position in the modern world."[8]

Actually, the locus classicus, the best formulation of this, was by an ambassador to the United Nations, Abba Eban,Israel's ambassador to the United Nations.... He advised the American Jewish community that they had two tasks to perform. One task was to show that criticism of the policy, what he called anti-Zionism—that means actually criticisms of the policy of the state of Israel—were anti-Semitism. That's the first task. Second task, if the criticism was made by Jews, their task was to show that it's neurotic self-hatred, needs psychiatric treatment. Then he gave two examples of the latter category. One was I. F. Stone. The other was me. So, we have to be treated for our psychiatric disorders, and non-Jews have to be condemned for anti-Semitism, if they're critical of the state of Israel. That's understandable why Israeli propaganda would take this position. I don't particularly blame Abba Eban for doing what ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do. But we ought to understand that there is no sensible charge. No sensible charge. There's nothing to respond to. It's not a form of anti-Semitism. It's simply criticism of the criminal actions of a state, period.[46]

In English the first major discussion of the topic was in the 1940s by Kurt Lewin, who was Lessing's colleague at the University of Berlin in 1930.[2] Lewin emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1933, and though focused on Jews also argued for a similar phenomenon among Polish, Italian and Greek immigrants to the USA.[3] Lewin's was a theoretical account, declaring that the issue "is well known among Jews themselves" and supporting his argument with anecdotes.[3] According to Lewin, a self-hating Jew "will dislike everything specifically Jewish, for he will see in it that which keeps him away from the majority for which he is longing. He will show dislike for those Jews who are outspokenly so, and will frequently indulge in self-hatred."[17] Following Lewin's lead, the concept gained widespread currency. "The 1940s and 1950s were 'the age of self-hatred'. In effect, a bitter war broke out over questions of Jewish identity. It was a kind of 'Jewish Cold War'..."[8] in which questions of Jewish identity were contentiously debated. The use of the concept in debates over Jewish identity – for example over resistance to the integration of African Americans into Jewish neighbourhoods – died down by the end of the 1970s, having been "steadily emptied of most of its earlier psychological, social, and theoretical content and became largely a slogan."[18]

The expression "self-hating Jew" is often used rhetorically, meaning towards Jews who differ in their lifestyles, interests or political positions from the speaker.[3]
The historian Bernard Wasserstein prefers the term "Jewish anti-Semitism," which he says was often termed "Jewish self-hatred".[12] He asks, "Could a Jew be an anti-Semite?", and responds that many Jews have "internalized elements of anti-Semitic discourse, succumbed to what Theodore Hamerow has called psychological surrender."[vague]Wasserstein goes on to say that self-hating Jews, "afflicted by some form of anti-Semitism[,] were not so much haters of themselves as haters of 'other' Jews."
Thus some of those who have been accused of being a "self-hating Jew" have characterized the term as a replacement for "a charge of anti-Semitism [that] will not stick,"[24] or as "pathologizing" them.[3][25] Some who use the term have equated it with "anti-Semitism",[26][27] on the part of those thus addressed, or with "so called 'enlightened' Jews who refuse to associate themselves with people who practice a 'backward' religion."[28] One novelist, Philip Roth, who — because of the nature of the Jewish characters in his novels, such as the 1969 Portnoy's Complaint[18] — has often been accused of being a "self-hating Jew", argues that all novels deal with human dilemmas and weaknesses (which are present in all communities), and that to self-censor by only writing about positive Jewish characters would represent a submission to antisemitism.[3]

Bernie Sanders, one of the Democratic candidates running for US Presidential elections in 2016 and 2020, was accused by comedian Jackie Mason of being a "self-hating Jew".[47][48] His brother, Larry Sanders, told the Times of Israel that this was because his brother disagreed with Benjamin Netanyahu's foreign policy. "Bernard is not a self-hating Jew. There was never a moment in our life when we had any reason to be self-hating. The fact that he does not agree with Netanyahu on politics does not make him a self-hating Jew."[49] In March 2016, after a reporter asked him if he was "intentionally keeping his Judaism in the background", Sanders stated that he is "very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I am. Look, my father's family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical, and extremist politics mean."[50] Max Berger wrote in Haaretz, "While some in the Jewish American establishment strive to marginalize Bernie and his movement by suggesting we're self-hating Jews who don't care about Israel, it just goes to show how badly out of touch they are with the future of our community, and the values of our tradition."[51] A related dispute revolved around his Jewish advisor, Simone Zimmerman, who was similarly accused of being a self-hating Jew. In These Times strongly criticized this accusation, describing it as "slandering".[52]

The concept of Jewish self-hatred has been described by Antony Lerman as "an entirely bogus concept",[7] one that "serves no other purpose than to marginalise and demonise political opponents",[8] who says that it is used increasingly as a personal attack in discussions about the "new antisemitism".[8]

Kenneth Levin, a Harvard psychiatrist, says that Jewish self-hatred has two causes: Stockholm syndrome, where "population segments under chronic siege commonly embrace the indictments of their besiegers however bigoted and outrageous", as well as "the psychodynamics of abused children, who almost invariably blame themselves for their predicament, ascribe it to their being 'bad,' and nurture fantasies that by becoming 'good' they can mollify their abusers and end their torment."[22] According to Howard W. Polsky, the social scientist, "feelings about Jewish marginality are often a step away from self-hatred." He then says, "Jewish self-hatred denotes that a person has adopted gentiles' definition of Jew as bad in one way or another and that being Jewish will hinder their success or identity."[23]

The issue has periodically been covered in the academic social psychology literature on social identity. Such studies "frequently cite Lewin as evidence that people may attempt to distance themselves from membership in devalued groups because they accept, to some degree, the negative evaluations of their group held by the majority and because these social identities are an obstacle to the pursuit of social status."[3] Modern social psychology literature uses terms such as "self-stigmatization", "internalized oppression", and "false consciousness" to describe this type of phenomenon. Phyllis Chesler, the professor of psychology and women's studies, in referring to female Jewish self-hatred, points to progressive Jewish women who "seem obsessed with the Palestinian point of view." She believes their rage against oppression, frustration and patriarchy "is being unconsciously transferred onto Israel."[21]

Yet such hostility between groups has at times drawn on some of the rhetoric of antisemitism: "criticism of subgroups of Jews which drew on anti-Semitic rhetoric were common in 19th and 20th century arguments over Jewish identity".[3] In practice, according to one academic, whilst there have been Jewish writers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who consistently employed virulent antisemitic rhetoric without seeming to value any aspects of being a Jew, too often "those who accuse others of being self-haters search for examples of when they have criticized Jews or Judaism but ignore examples of when those they criticize have shown they value being a Jew."[3] He argues that Jewish antisemitism does not necessarily amount to self-hatred, implying that "antisemitic Jew" may be a more accurate term to use. Other authors have also shown a preference for using "antisemitism" rather than "self-hatred."[4][12]

According to Amos Elon, during 19th-century German-Jewish assimilation, conflicting pressures on sensitive and privileged or gifted young Jews produced "a reaction later known as 'Jewish self-hatred.' Its roots were not simply professional or political but emotional."[14] Elon uses the term "Jewish self-hatred" synonymously with Jewish antisemitism when he points out, "One of the most prominent Austrian anti-Semites was Otto Weininger a brilliant young Jew" who "published 'Sex and Character', attacking Jews and women." Elon attributes Jewish antisemitism as a cause in the overall growth of antisemitism when he says,"(Weininger's) book inspired the typical Viennese adage that anti-Semitism did not really get serious until it was taken up by Jews."

The term is in use in Jewish publications such as The Jewish Week (New York) and The Jerusalem Post (Jerusalem) in a number of contexts, often synonymously with antisemitic Jew. It is used "to criticize a performer or artist who portrays Jews negatively; as a shorthand description of supposed psychological conflict in fictional characters; in articles about the erosion of tradition (e.g. marrying out and circumcision); and to discount Jews who criticize Israeli policies or particular Jewish practices."[3] However the widest usage of the term is currently in relation to debates over Israel. "In these debates the accusation is used by right-wing Zionists to assert that Zionism and/or support for Israel is a core element of Jewish identity. Jewish criticism of Israeli policy is therefore considered a turning away from Jewish identity itself."[3]

"Self-loathing Jew" is synonymously used with "self-hating Jew." "Antisemitic Jew" can be used synonymously as well. "Self-hating Jew" has also been compared to the term "Uncle Tom" which is used in the African-American community.[53][54] The term "auto-antisemitism" (Hebrew: אוטואנטישמיות, autoantishemiut) is also synonymously used in Hebrew.[55][56][57] In a column in Haaretz, Uzi Zilber used the term "Jew Flu" as a synonym for Jewish self-hatred.[58]

It is argued by some academics that the concept of Jewish self-hatred is based on an essentialisation of Jewish identity. Accounts of Jewish self-hatred often suggest that criticizing other Jews, and integrating with Gentile society, reveals hatred of one's own Jewish origins.[3] Yet both in the early twentieth century, where the concept developed, and today, there are groups of Jews who had "important differences in identity based on class, culture, religious outlook, and education", and hostility between these groups can only be considered self-hate "if one assumes that a superordinate Jewish identity should take precedence over other groupings of Jews."[3]
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, "Love, Hate, and Jewish Identity", First Things, November 1997.
Jon Stewart, former host of The Daily Show, was repeatedly called a "self-hating Jew" by people whom he described as "fascistic".[43] Considering the term to be like equating someone with the Jews who turned their backs on each other during the Holocaust, he said, "I have people that I lost in the Holocaust and I just … go fuck yourself. How dare you?" Stewart commented that the way his critics used the term—to define who is a Jew and who is not—was formerly always done by people who weren't Jewish. He saw this as "more than nationalism". Stewart also criticized right-wing Jews for implying that they are the only ones who can decide what it means to be Jewish: "And you can't observe [Judaism] in the way you want to observe. And I never thought that that would be coming from brethren. ... How dare they? That they only know the word of God and are the ones who are able to disseminate it. It's not right."[44] To The Hollywood Reporter, he said, "Look, there's a lot of reasons why I hate myself—being Jewish isn't one of them."[45]
Usage of self-hatred can also designate dislike, or hatred, of a group to which one belongs. The term has a long history in debates over the role of Israel in Jewish identity, where it is used against Jewish critics of Israeli government policy.[3]

According to John P. Jackson Jr., the concept developed in the late 19th century in German Jewish discourse as "a response of German Jews to popular anti-Semitism that primarily was directed at Eastern European Jews." For German Jews, the Eastern European Jew became the "bad Jew".[15] According to Sander Gilman, the concept of the "self-hating Jew" developed from a merger of the image of the "mad Jew" and the "self-critical Jew",[2] and was developed to counter suggestions that an alleged Jewish stereotype of mental illness was due to inbreeding. "Within the logic of the concept, those who accuse others of being self-hating Jews may themselves be self-hating Jews."[16] Gilman says "the ubiquitousness of self-hatred cannot be denied. And it has shaped the self-awareness of those treated as different perhaps more than they themselves have been aware."[1]: 1

The Israeli-born British Jazz saxophonist, writer and Hebrew speaking anti-Semite of Jewish descent Gilad Atzmon openly used the term to describe himself in a 2010 interview for the Cyprus Mail. In that interview, Atzmon calls himself a "proud self-hating Jew" and also described fellow Jewish anti-Semite, the Austrian Otto Weininger as one as well. At the same time, Atzmon stated that he considers a "self-hating Jew" as very different to a "proud self-hating Jew", considering "proud self-hating Jews" such as himself and Weininger as celebrating the hatred they feel for themselves, the Jewish people, Judaism, Israel and anything else they associate with Jewishness.[29] Atzmon has taken several positions on history and politics associated with anti-Semitism including but not limited to, endorsing on his blog the conspiracy theory that "the Jewish people" are trying to take over the world[30][31][32] (though he later amended the original blog post[33] to replace "the Jewish people" with "Zionists"[34][35]), blaming the entire Jewish people for killing Jesus (including those not even born at the time),[36] accusing Gideon Falter (the chairman of the Campaign Against Antisemitism) of faking anti-Semitic incidents for profit (Falter then sued Atzmon for libel which Atzmon lost and was left with expensive legal costs[37]) and promoting the conspiracy theory of Holocaust denial, even publicly advising people to read Holocaust denying books by David Irving.[38] TheSouthern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)'s official blog Hatewatch written by David Neiwert noted that Atzmon was "a self-described 'self-hating ex-Jew' whose writings and pronouncements are rich in conspiracy theories, Holocaust trivialization and distortion, and open support of anti-Israeli terrorist groups."[39]

The specific terms "self-hating Jew" and "Jewish self-hatred" only came into use later, developing from Theodor Herzl's polemical use of the term "anti-Semite of Jewish origin", in the context of his project of political Zionism.[2] The underlying concept gained common currency in this context, "since Zionism was an important part of the vigorous debates that were occurring amongst Jews at the time about anti-Semitism, assimilation and Jewish identity."[3] Herzl appears to have introduced the phrase "anti-Semite of Jewish origin" in his 1896 book, Der Judenstaat (The Jews' State), which launched political Zionism.[2]

Self-hating Jew or self-loathing Jew, transliterated in Hebrew as auto-antisemitism, is a term which is used to describe Jews whose views are perceived as antisemitic.[1] The concept gained widespread currency after Theodor Lessing's 1930 book Der jüdische Selbsthaß (Jewish Self-hatred), which sought to explain a perceived inclination among Jewish intellectuals, toward inciting antisemitism, by stating their views about Judaism. The term is said to have become "something of a key term of opprobrium in and beyond Cold War-era debates about Zionism".[2]

The origins of terms such as "Jewish self-hatred" lie in the mid-19th century feuding between German Orthodox Jews of the Breslau seminary and Reform Jews.[8] Each side accused the other of betraying Jewish identity,[2] the Orthodox Jews accusing the Reform Jews of identifying more closely with German Protestantism and German nationalism than with Judaism.[8]
