Tonal inconsistency was a point of contention among critics, including David Rooney of Variety, who found that the film "seems unsure whether to push for suburban-Gothic psychosexual excess or tongue-in-cheek malevolence... the film is derailed by its own silliness."[23] Christy Lemire of MSNBC complained that "Not a single moment feels believable in the film, which is trying very hard to be a sexy, intense psychological thriller but instead just feels lurid and exploitative."[18] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly deemed the film "dank and rhythmless,"[33] while Andrew O'Hehir of Salon wrote that it is "a terrible example of what can happen when the wrong sets of talented people get together. It isn't convincing as talky psychological realism or as high-school satire or as ghoulish forbidden melodrama, although Belle and Cuthbert have their best and creepiest moments in that mode."[7] Alternately, James Berardinelli of Reel Views praised the film for its depiction of familial sexual abuse victims, writing: "One strength of The Quiet is that it does not deal exploitatively with the incest/sexual abuse issue in its quest to generate tension. This is a grim subject, and Babbit gives it its due. Nina is obviously confused and damaged."[34]

The second feature film by Babbit after the 1999 comedy But I'm a Cheerleader, The Quiet was shot in Austin, Texas in 2004, the first film by the University of Texas's Burnt Orange production company. Cuthbert served as an associate producer of the film. Its soundtrack features songs by Low, Cat Power, Le Tigre, and numerous Beethoven piano sonatas. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival before being acquired by Destination Films, who released it in the United States theatrically through Sony Pictures Classics in August 2005.
Upon its original release, critic Andrew O'Hehir of Salon noted that The Quiet "wobbles between genres."[7] In his 2017 book Twenty First Century Horror Films, film scholar Douglas Keesey classifies The Quiet as a horror film, writing that Dot represents "the gothic heroine haunted by her past," while Nina embodies "the girl in a horror movie whose fear of a monster invading her bedroom comes true."[8] Alexandra Heller-Nicholas of Vulture also considers it a horror film that exemplifies a "gothic incest nightmare...  Vicious, tragic, and heartbreaking, The Quiet is contemporary suburban gothic at its bleakest."[9] Director Jamie Babbit commented in 2006 that she had largely been drawn to the screenplay because it exemplified the "suburban horror genre."[10]

Cuthbert had initially wanted to play the role of the silent Dot, but director Jamie Babbit instead cast Belle in that part[14] after Thora Birch dropped out of the project.[15] Babbit reasoned that "To me, Dot has to be someone you could believe would be invisible in high school. You look at Elisha, this beautiful woman with the most perfect body you've ever seen and you think, there's no high school in America where this girl could be invisible. No matter how much hair and makeup I do, it's not going to happen."[14] Cuthbert ultimately agreed to take the role,[16] though she initially found it difficult to connect with: "I had a healthy childhood. That was a conflict for me because I had nothing to draw on for this character. Everything about this character made no sense in some ways. Everything about me wanted to defend myself and stand up for myself, but I couldn't do that for the character because this is all she knows. It was challenging."[17]

Nina and Dot prepare to attend the school's spring dance the following night. While getting ready, Nina tells Dot she is going to kill Paul that night and run away with the abortion money he is giving her. She explains that she will find work as a stripper, believing she can become famous "like Courtney Love." Before the girls depart for the dance, Paul confronts Nina after finding tampons in her purse, and accuses her of lying about the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Dot, who is playing "Moonlight Sonata" downstairs, hears the argument. The confrontation becomes violent, and eventually descends into a rape before Dot comes to Nina's defense, strangling Paul to death with a piano wire. Olivia, in a drug-induced stupor, stumbles upon the scene, unfazed by her husband's corpse, but amazed by the revelation that Dot can hear.

Assessment of the acting of Cuthbert and Belle was often positive: Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times, though dismissive of the film overall, wrote that "Both Cuthbert and Belle are nimble, surprising actresses, and they manage to navigate the film’s increasingly ridiculous twists with their dignity intact."[38] Gazelle Emami of The Daily Californian similarly conceded that, "Despite the plot's failings, Cuthbert does a convincing job in her role, exuding an outer shell so tough that when her inner, softer layers emerge, it's a natural change of character."[11] Empire Movies agreed, commenting that "this is Elisha Cuthbert's best film performance to date. Cuthbert's Nina has the majority of the most graphic and disturbing dialogue in the film, especially during one particular lunchroom scene where the camera is close up on Cuthbert and Belle's faces."[35] Metroactive also noted that "Belle nearly carries The Quiet in her close-ups."[24] Mel Valentin of SF Station agreed that "performance wise, The Quiet belongs to Camilla Belle and Elisha Cuthbert," noting that "Belle ... has to act through body language and facial expressions [and] mostly carries it off, but even a talented actress can only do so much with such a passive role ... Cuthbert acquits herself well in the more active, substantive role (again, for the most part), but her performance is undermined by the questionable decision to put her character in skimpy clothing."[26] However, Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle dissented, arguing that "Cuthbert flounces around a lot but doesn't have the range to express Nina's feelings."[39] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said of Belle that "on screen she's hollow. The film is already visually dead, and it dies a little more whenever she's alone in a scene, which is often."[6]
The Quiet is a 2005 American psychological thriller film directed by Jamie Babbit and starring Elisha Cuthbert, Camilla Belle, Martin Donovan, and Edie Falco. It focuses on a deaf teenage orphan who is sent to live with her godparents. She soon becomes a sounding board for the family members, who confess their darkest secrets to her, including the incestous relationship between her godfather and his teenage daughter.
The film was shot during September and October 2004 in Austin, Texas,[20] and was produced by the University of Texas' Burnt Orange productions[16] as their first feature.[21] It was made for approximately $1 million, funded by the University of Texas Film Institute.[14] Although the film is set in suburban Connecticut,[22] Bowie High School in Austin was the principal filming location.[15] A total of 36 University of Texas students worked on the film.[20]

A number of critics noted that the film exemplified camp, including Jeff Shannon of The Seattle Times who noted it "bordered" on it, and was "loaded with lesbian undertones... this wretched drama plays like a high-school horror flick that trades monsters and mayhem for an overdose of force-fed cruelty."[5] Bruce Kirkland of Canoe concurred: "If the subject matter was not so damn depressing, this dialogue would be camp-style laughable."[22] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times similarly noted that the film lacked the "go-for-broke lunacy that makes a flick like Wild Things a classic of its trashy kind and might have saved this film."[30]

Following its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005, the film initially failed to find a distributor.[21] It was released in cinemas by Sony Pictures Classics, first opening in seven theaters in New York and Los Angeles on August 25, 2006,[27] where it earned $27,546 in its opening weekend.[2]
The actors were brought together before filming commenced to go through ideas relating to the film, in order that they were familiar with the long-term situation of the characters.[11] Cuthbert spoke to psychiatrists about sexual abuse, and the cast read articles about women who had been sexually abused.[19]

The film was commercially unsuccessful but found success in DVD sales.[3] Many critics at the time of its release dismissed it as sleazy, exploitative, and difficult to watch, with several noting that it was too serious to be satire, yet too campy to be taken seriously.[4]

Michelle arrives at the house to pick Nina and Dot up. The two quickly change their dresses, which are soaked in blood, and leave. At the dance, Dot reveals to Connor that she can hear and speak; angered by her deception, he storms away. Nina and Dot leave the dance, and walk to a riverbank in the woods, where they bury a backpack containing their blood-soaked clothing. Nina asks Dot why she pretended to be deaf-mute. Dot explains that, after her mother died during her childhood, she stopped speaking and began communicating only with sign language, as it made her feel closer to her father. When the girls return home, they find police cars at the house, and Olivia turning herself in for Paul's murder. Olivia apologizes to her daughter, and atones for having allowed Paul's sexual abuse of Nina go ignored. The following morning, Nina and Dot sit together and play piano, freed from their respective fathers.

At school, Dot is a social outcast, though Connor, a basketball player, takes an interest in her, much to the chagrin of Nina's abrasive friend, Michelle, who is pursuing him. One afternoon, Nina returns home early from cheerleading practice and overhears Dot playing Beethoven on the family's piano. When one of the strings breaks, Nina hears Dot swear loudly, before vocally harmonizing with the strings as she tunes them. Realizing Dot is neither deaf nor mute, Nina withholds her knowledge of this. At lunch the next day, acting under the guise that Dot cannot hear, Nina assays her by confessing her hatred of her father, and details her plan to murder him.

The scene where Nina's father Paul attacks her was notably difficult to film, because Cuthbert was genuinely hurt by Donovan, who was "very method" during filming, and Babbit was caught between wanting to protect her and the need for Cuthbert "to go to a scary place." Cuthbert said that playing a victim was hard for her, and that "there were moments when I would go to the bathroom and bawl."[11]
The writing of the film's characters was a point of contention, with Metroactive noting that "The role [of Olivia, Nina's mother] is savagely underwritten, leaving [Edie] Falco dangling, motiveless, for much of the movie";[24] Monsters & Critics also felt that "at times her character seems like more of an after thought than having any real purpose."[31] IndieWire also felt that the characters of Dot and Nina were underwritten,[25] and Empire Movies similarly decried the "blatant under-use of two talented young actresses."[35] The Houston Chronicle's Bruce Westbrook criticized the film for "utterly failing its characters."[36] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News noted that the film had "an awful script that features some howlingly bad dialogue."[37]
Following the accidental death of her deaf father, Dot, an orphaned teenager who is also deaf-mute, is sent to live in Connecticut with her godparents, Paul and Olivia Deer, and their teenaged daughter, Nina. Dot and Nina had been friends in childhood, before Dot lost her hearing as a result of a medical condition. The aloof Nina resents Dot's presence in the home and insults her repeatedly. Meanwhile, Dot observes that Olivia, an unfulfilled interior designer who was close friends with Dot's mother, is an alcoholic with a prescription drug addiction. Late one night, while returning to her bedroom, Dot observes Paul and Nina having sex in Nina's bedroom, unbeknownst to them. It becomes clear that Nina and Paul have had a years-long incestuous relationship, which Nina uses as leverage against her father to get whatever she wants.

The film was shot in high-definition video.[14] Variety said that "[director of photography] M. David Mullen's high-definition, widescreen camerawork supplies a lucid, moody look, matched by Jeff Rona's brooding score."[23] MSNBC's Christy Lemire noted that "Every frame of The Quiet, with its overly styled blue-gray tint and hazy interiors, calls to mind 9½ Weeks, Fatal Attraction or Unfaithful."[18] Metroactive saw that "the purplish blues (the color that seems to work best in HD) are deeply saturated for such a cost-effective medium, and the color is never milky or streaky. At times, Mullen and Babbit overdo the murk."[24] IndieWire agreed, noting that the "use of smoke to mask the use of high-def video ... results in laughably inexplicable smoky interiors lit like a high school production of Les Miserables."[25] SF Station's Mel Valentin argued that Babbit effectively exaggerated the limitations of the budget and using HD video: "the video artifacts, lighting, night-time shooting, and sparse sets end up creating an oneiric, fairy-tale quality that helps to balances out the undercurrent of violence that permeates the characters’ actions."[26]

Belle's role as Dot was a departure from previous roles and the film was released around the same time as two other indie films starring Belle, The Ballad of Jack and Rose and The Chumscrubber.[13] Belle learned sign language and classical piano for the role,[13] and wore no makeup for the part.[18] She said of her part that "It was a lonely time 'cause she is a very lonely, depressing character."[13] Cuthbert said that acting her part was complicated by Belle "not doing a whole lot in the movie, as far as dialogue goes – it was difficult, because we had to find the right timing and the beats."[12]

In contrast, Andrea Chase of Killer Movie Reviews called the film "a disturbing drama that is as riveting to watch as it is challenging to contemplate."[28] MTV called it "a powerful tale of seclusion, sexual abuse and sisterhood."[12] The Monitor believed that "underappreciated at the box office, this film is, excuse the pun, quietly powerful."[15] Patrick Luce of Monsters & Critics called it "a slow-burn thriller that keeps the audience hooked ... thanks to a disturbing plot and solid performances from its cast."[31] Shawn Levy of The Oregonian also gave a favorable review, awarding it a B-rating and writing that "Babbit, with unnervingly beautiful compositions and sharp editing, lures you so skillfully into the film's awful revelations and sickening atmosphere, you feel rather like Dot: defenseless, alone, vulnerable."[32]

After appearing in The Girl Next Door, Cuthbert wanted to "not just ... play the hot girl in the movie, it kills me." She had just finished the House of Wax and "was ready to do something that was definitely more character-driven."[11] She read the Sundance workshop script by writers Abdi Nazemian and Micah Shraft, who had not previously made a feature film, and became an associate producer for the film,[12] originally to be titled Dot.[13]

Quiet is an album by jazz guitarist John Scofield. As with his 1992 album Grace Under Pressure, Scofield chose to integrate a horn section into his compositions. The album also features bass guitarist Steve Swallow (who was in Scofield's trio of 1980-1983), and drummer Bill Stewart. Quiet is unique in Scofield's discography as he plays only acoustic guitar. Veteran saxophonist Wayne Shorter appears on several tracks. Scofield returned to this album's format of a trio with orchestration on This Meets That in 2007.

If Quiet is recruited into Diamond Dogs, it is possible for the player to use her as a Buddy character on missions. When chosen, Quiet is most useful as a support providing covering fire during infiltration missions.[24] Quiet's interactions and skills depends on the bond level between her and Venom Snake; she can be equipped with either her standard rifle named Wicked Butterfly, a non-lethal rifle named Guilty Butterfly, firing tranquilizer rounds, or a high-powered lethal rifle named Sinful Butterfly. An unlockable allows the player to unlock Sniper Wolf's uniform from the original Metal Gear Solid for Quiet to wear.[25]

Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy (see below), but said, "When I got to see her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn't get to hear her story yet so I can understand people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it."[20] Joosten also talked of pre-release fan theories such as these of Quiet being a sex-changed Chico from the previous prequel games or a young Sniper Wolf, both of which she denied.[21] Kojima later stated in 2015, "I know there's people concerning about 'Quiet' but don't worry. I created her character as an antithesis to the women characters appeared in the past fighting game who are excessively exposed. 'Quiet' who doesn't have a word will be teased in the story as well. But once you recognize the secret reason for her exposure, you will feel ashamed of your words & deeds."[22] He added, "The response of 'Quiet' disclosure few days ago incited by the net is exactly what MGSV itself is."[23]

Quiet was modeled after, motion captured and voiced by Dutch model Stefanie Joosten. She received a phone call from her agency to audition as a motion capture actress for an unspecified video game.[2] However, being a big fan of video games, she recognized game director Hideo Kojima at the audition and suspected it was for a new Metal Gear game.[3] After getting the role and beginning the motion capture and 3D scanning[4] process, Joosten was shown artwork of the character, which she said looked almost exactly the same as the finished product, but was not told specifically what character she would be playing.[5] The process took two years and, having never held a gun before, she received professional combat training in order to handle several weapons.[6] Although the character does not speak during most of the game, Kojima was so satisfied with Joosten's work[7] that he asked her to "voice" the character by expressing range of emotions through only groans and hums.[8] "Quiet's Theme", a humming vocal piece composed by Akihiro Honda and written by Ludvig Forrsell, was sung by Joosten for the game's original soundtrack; she also performed it on stage at The Game Awards 2015.[9]

Before the release of the game, the presentation of Quiet was criticized for being what was perceived by some as oversexualization and an affirmation of the negative stereotype of the video game industry.[30][31] Square Enix released Quiet's action figure in the Play Arts KAI series in May 2015.[32] The figure's soft, pliable breasts demonstrated on Twitter by Kojima and Shinkawa, the latter of whom did serve as its production supervisor,[33] were criticized in social media and in the press in the West.[34][35][36] She was generally well received in Japan. AOL Japan noted that the announcement of the "erotic" figure caused a buzz on Twitter.[37] Famitsu positively commented on the "realistic fleshiness" of the figure,[38] in addition to focusing on the beauty of the "real Quiet" Stefanie Joosten and how well the "super sexy" game character was made to resemble her.[39][40][41] A more conventional, 1/6 scale statue of Quiet was released by Gecco Corp in 2016;[42] its review by Dengeki Hobby praised this figure for its high quality and for showing the various aspects of the character's attractiveness and an attention to detail.[43] Another Quiet figure was released by Octohead in 2018.[44]

"Why Quiet Wears That Skimpy Outfit In Metal Gear Solid V"
When asked about Quiet, Kojima replied: "In the game, Quiet is the main heroine. Whether she is friend or foe has yet to be revealed so I had to be careful when casting her role. MGS normally has old timers and old guys (laughs). Stefanie is very skilled in action but since she never held that type of gun, we asked her to do some training at home."[11] Speaking about Quiet's design just days after her full reveal in September 2013, Kojima tweeted that he asked lead designer Yoji Shinkawa for a "more erotic" character; in fact, his original idea of her was her being naked.[12] In response to the reaction to this statement, he clarified: "Maybe the phrase 'erotic' wasn't really [the correct word for] what I was trying to say. What I'm really trying to do is create unique characters. One of those is, of course, Quiet. She's a really unique character, I wanted to add that sexiness to her. It wasn't really supposed to be erotic, but sexy." He also said, "You're going to notice [when you play,] but there's limited dialogue with [characters], and for that reason we really want to show the characteristic from each character. Sexy could be for guys, weapons, vehicles, it's really that characteristic." Shinkawa added, "From my perspective, it's not just the characters, but often I look at a weapon or a vehicle and think 'That's really sexy.' It's not just the characters, but the mechs and weapons [as well]."[13]

On the other hand, GameZone's James Wynne felt that the game's story explanation was a valid enough reason for her scantily-clad appearance and succeeds in Kojima's aim to make Quiet "a true antithesis to sexy-just-because female characters." He wrote that "Fan service doesn't erase the fact that Quiet is a strong, well-written character that doesn't need a man to save her. That puts her on a level comparable to The Boss, who was the most impressive female character to ever grace a video game."[50] Vince Ingenito of IGN called Quiet the most interesting character in the game, writing that her "warm, childlike sincerity and battlefield ferocity cause her to steal every scene she's in." He did feel disappointed that she was also "required to be a lust-object."[51]

Metal Gear Solid 5 - Turning Stefanie Joosten Into Quiet
"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain - Quiet - Play Arts Kai (Square Enix)"
HIDEO_KOJIMA (2013-09-07). "(Cont) The response of "Quiet" disclosure few days ago incited by the net is exactly what "MGSV" itself is". @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN. Archived from the original on 2016-02-01. Retrieved 2019-06-14.
Within the Metal Gear series, Quiet appears only in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. When Big Boss awakens in a Cyprus hospital from a coma in 1984, Quiet is one of many soldiers sent by Cipher to kill him. As she is about to kill her target, a man calling himself Ishmael helps fight her off. She is covered in medical grade ethanol and other chemicals and lit on fire until she escapes via a window.[22]
The finished game drew more Western criticism of Quiet's portrayal in both reviews and opinion pieces.[46][47] GamesRadar's David Roberts described Quiet as "one of the most complex and conflicted characters in MGS5", but that her depiction was an example of a "juvenile approach to sexuality" that typifies Kojima's work and the Metal Gear series as a whole.[48] Michael McWhertor of Polygon described the justification for Quiet's lack of clothing as "inextricably tied to the game's convoluted story", and criticized how the game presented other female characters by "zeroing in on their jiggling breasts and panning across their asses in a silly, oversexualized way."[49]

The November 2015 release of the Version 1.06 update adds the ability to bring Quiet back in the game. The player needs to complete "Mission 11: Cloaked in Silence" seven times in a row without killing or leaving Quiet, to unlock a version of the mission titled "[Reunion]: Cloaked in Silence". Completing this new version of the mission will have Quiet return permanently with all of the equipment she had at the time she left.[26] A 2018 update has turned Quiet into an optional player character in FOB missions online.[27] The playable Quiet's primary weapon remains a sniper rifle. Her superhuman abilities enable her to perform special dashes; she can also drop safely from any height and climb in an instant.[28][29]

Kojima stated Quiet's design was to appeal to cosplayers and to sell figures;[14] he also made further tweets to demonstrate details of the character to early cosplayers.[15][16] Kojima said about her clothing, "Once you see how she fits into the story, you will understand why she looks the way she does. Without any of this background I can certainly understand why there are concerns. I will say there's a reason she looks the way she does and wears those clothes. And it's all a part of the game, learning those reasons one by one."[17] As noted by Kojima himself, Quiet is the only heroic female character of Metal Gear Solid V, contrasting with the usual three of four in most of his earlier works; he described her as powerful yet vulnerable.[18] He also later compared Quiet to Matilda Lutz's protagonist character from the 2017 rape and revenge action-thriller film Revenge.[19]

In the initial release of the game, some players were disappointed that they lost the option of using Quiet as an ally after completing "Mission 45: A Quiet Exit".[52] Roberts wrote that few developers would be willing to incur the wrath of players by creating one of the most powerful characters in the game, "integrating her completely so as to make her absolutely vital during some particularly difficult missions, then taking her away forever. But it's one of the many ways Kojima is able to express the game's themes — of loss, of despair, of that lingering 'phantom pain' right there in the game's title — and I respect the hell out of Kojima for removing a core component of gameplay to express those themes."[53]

Quiet received a mixed reception. While she was praised for her characterization, many Western critics considered her design oversexualized, though some defended it by citing her backstory, including Joosten herself. In regards to the visual design, Kojima remarked that he was striving for a unique character, not simply eroticism. Quiet has become a popular character to cosplay.

Quiet (Japanese: クワイエット, Hepburn: Kuwaietto) is a fictional character from Konami's Metal Gear series. Created by Hideo Kojima, designed by Yoji Shinkawa, and based on and voiced by Stefanie Joosten, Quiet appears in the 2015 action-adventure stealth game, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain as one of the game bosses opposing the protagonist Venom Snake, but can also become an ally who can go on missions with him. The character is a skilled assassin and sniper with superhuman abilities belonging to the covert strike force XOF, a rogue division of the American intelligence agency Cipher. Depending on the player's actions, she can be captured by Venom Snake and eventually used as a member of his Diamond Dogs mercenary group.

Filming was initially intended to take place in Cleveland, but due to budget issues, Dornetto and Jamie Babbit had to shift the film's setting to Fresno, a location they chose because it seemed like it was a city people wanted to get away from. Babbit and her films were very successful at the Fresno Reel Pride Film Festival, which she attended several times, giving her an idea of the city's pros and cons. (Producer Andrea Sperling also enjoyed a strong relationship with Reel Pride). The film was workshopped as part of the "Made in Cleveland" project, an anthology of 11 short films. Shot in Cleveland in 2012 and released in theaters in 2013, the short film was called Fucking Cleveland, starred Busy Philipps and Gillian Jacobs in the lead roles, and was shot on a budget of $50,000.[4]
While writing the script, Karey Dornetto partially drew upon her own past relationship with her sister, wondering, "What if I still lived in my same hometown and we were in this sort of a meshed relationship, like a co-dependent relationship?".[4] From there she began to add the film's fictional elements such as Shannon's sex addiction.[4]

In a mixed review, CraveOnline wrote that it "is full of gleeful raunchiness and a registered sex offender or two, but not much actual comedy."[13] The Austin Chronicle wrote, "This heavy comedy, scripted by Karey Dornetto, delivers its expected yield of snappy and emotionally charged levity from a charismatic cast that also features Fred Armisen, Molly Shannon, and Aubrey Plaza in supporting roles. But as the story's centerpiece, Greer's character ultimately gives the audience too little to root for. Insufferable and unrepentant until far too late, we don't feel conflicted like we should when her lone true ally finally says 'enough is enough.' And although it's hard to pry our eyes away from such a cool cast, by that time the feeling is mutual."[14] Variety was also mixed in their opinion, as they felt that the work would likely not gather the cult following that Babbit's 1999 film But I'm a Cheerleader received and that Fresno was overall "a mean-spirited farce whose strenuous bad taste seldom translates into actual laughs."[15]

Judy Greer and Natasha Lyonne anchor it with a priceless good sister/bad sister dynamic; Lyonne is atypically sunny (and typically delightful) while Greer, as a bitter burnout, puts a sharp little spin on every line, turning each into a little dagger. Aubrey Plaza also shines in a brief but juicy bit as a would-be love interest for Lyonne."[18]

To take the stress off, Martha goes to the gym while Shannon hooks up with her co-worker Eric. At the gym, Kelly informs Martha that one of her students is having a bar mitzvah and that she wants to bring Martha along as a date. After the gym, Martha returns and catches Shannon making out with Eric, much to her annoyance. While discussing the bar mitzvah the next day, they realize they can steal all of the money. Martha and Shannon double date with Kelly and Eric. Martha pretends she is choking on something to distract the crowd long enough to steal the money.

Kelly confesses that she is attracted to Martha, but Martha blows her off by telling her about her sister who has problems.
Martha and Shannon take the corpse over to their friends Gerald and Ruby, who own a pet cemetery. After uncovering Boris' corpse, they at first threaten to call the police, but then decide to blackmail the sisters for $25,000 by Monday in exchange for covering up the murder, threatening to charge them with manslaughter if they are unable to come up with the money. They initially attempt to rob an adult store to steal all the merchandise and try to sell them to lesbians at an event being held at the local hotel they work at, only to discover they did not make enough money.

The film had its world premiere on March 14, 2015, at South by Southwest.

In August 2014, it was announced that Judy Greer and Natasha Lyonne would portray the two central characters of Fresno, marking the second time Lyonne had worked with Babbit.[5] The two actresses stated that part of the reason that they chose to act in the film was because their characters were atypical to how they were traditionally cast, as Lyonne is usually cast as a "trainwreck" while Greer was usually the "levelheaded" character.[6] The actors were encouraged to engage in improvisation, though they stayed close to the script. Influences included Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995), Bottle Rocket (1996), and Bridesmaids (2011).[4] Shooting took place in Los Angeles.[7]

However, James N. Frey defines psychological thrillers as a style, rather than a subgenre; Frey states good thrillers focus on the psychology of their antagonists and build suspense slowly through ambiguity.[8] Creators and/or film distributors or publishers who seek to distance themselves from the negative connotations of horror often categorize their work as a psychological thriller.[9] The same situation can occur when critics label a work to be a psychological thriller in order to elevate its perceived literary value.[8]

In psychological thrillers, characters often have to battle an inner struggle. Amnesia is a common plot device used to explore these questions. Character may be threatened with death, be forced to deal with the deaths of others, or fake their own deaths.[5] Psychological thrillers can be complex, and reviewers may recommend a second or third viewing to "decipher its secrets."[13] Common elements may include stock characters, such as a hardboiled detective and serial killer, involved in a cat and mouse game.[14] Sensation novels, examples of early psychological thrillers, were considered to be socially irresponsible due to their themes of sex and violence. These novels, among others, were inspired by the exploits of real-life detective Jack Whicher.[15] Water, especially floods, is frequently used to represent the unconscious mind, such as in What Lies Beneath and In Dreams.[16] Psychological thrillers may not always be concerned with plausibility. Peter Hutchings defines the giallo, an Italian subgenre of psychological thrillers, as violent murder mysteries that focus on style and spectacle over rationality.[17] According to Peter B. Flint of The New York Times, detractors of Alfred Hitchcock accused him of "relying on slick tricks, illogical story lines and wild coincidences".[18]
Dario Argento – Italian director known for his cult films in giallo, horror, and psychological thrillers. He is often referred to as "the Italian Hitchcock".[20]

According to director John Madden, psychological thrillers focus on story, character development, choice, and moral conflict; fear and anxiety drive the psychological tension in unpredictable ways. Madden stated their lack of spectacle and strong emphasis on character led to their decline in Hollywood popularity.[6] Psychological thrillers are suspenseful by exploiting uncertainty over characters' motives, honesty, and how they see the world.[7] Films can also cause discomfort in audiences by privileging them with information they wish to share with the characters; guilty characters may suffer similar distress by virtue of their knowledge.[5]

In terms of context and convention, it is a subgenre of the broader ranging thriller narrative structure,[1] with similarities to Gothic and detective fiction in the sense of sometimes having a "dissolving sense of reality". It is often told through the viewpoint of psychologically stressed characters, revealing their distorted mental perceptions and focusing on the complex and often tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters.[2] Psychological thrillers often incorporate elements of mystery, drama, action, and paranoia. The genre is closely related to and sometimes overlaps with the psychological drama and psychological horror genres, the latter generally involving more horror and terror elements and themes and more disturbing or frightening scenarios.[3]

Marshall attended ten different schools throughout the Southern U.S. in Greensboro; Bartlett and Memphis and throughout Georgia and South Carolina. At times she was left in the care of her grandmother.[9] She was not allowed to buy records when she was growing up, but she listened to her stepfather's record collection, which included artists Otis Redding, Creedence Clearwater Revival and The Rolling Stones,[11] as well as her parents' records, which included Black Flag, Sister Sledge, and Barry White.[12] In sixth grade, she adopted the nickname Chan (pronounced "Shawn"), which she would later use professionally.[13] When she was 13, she listened to the Smiths, the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. She had to save up to buy cassettes and the first one she got was a record by the Misfits.[14] At age 16, Marshall dropped out of high school and became estranged from her mother, having no further contact with her until she was 24.[3]

In February 2012, Marshall cancelled a scheduled appearance in Tel Aviv, Israel, citing "much confusion" and that she felt "sick in her spirit."[59] She had faced calls to boycott the country over its conflict with Palestine.[60] Two months later, she cancelled her appearance at the Coachella Music Festival, claiming that she "didn't think it was fair to play Coachella while my new album is not yet finished," also hinting that her forthcoming record is "almost done" and will see release later in 2012.[61] Marshall's ninth studio album, Sun, was released in September 2012,[62][63] after releasing the lead single "Ruin" as a free download the previous June. The album features prominent electronica elements and arrangements, which Marshall incorporated into the "really slow guitar-based songs" she had originally written.[64] In a review published on September 4, 2012, on Consequence of Sound, Sun was praised as a unique album and received a four-star rating. In summation, reviewer Sarah Grant wrote that Marshall's 2012 release is "a passionate pop album of electronic music filtered through a singer-songwriter's soul."[65] The album debuted at a career chart-high of No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling over 23,000 copies on its opening week.[6]

Cat Power's early releases have been described as blending elements of punk, folk, and blues, while her later releases (post-2000) began to incorporate more sophisticated arrangements and production.[90][91][92] The Greatest (2006), Marshall's seventh release, was heavily soul-influenced and incorporated R&B elements; the Memphis Rhythm Band provided backing instrumentation on the album.[93] Unlike her previous releases, which featured sparse guitar and piano arrangements, The Greatest was described by Marshall biographer Sarah Goodman as her first "full-blown studio record with sophisticated production and senior players backing [Marshall] up."[94]
Marshall's live shows have been known for their unpolished and often erratic nature, with songs beginning and ending abruptly or blending into one another without clear transitions.[95] She has also cut short performances without explanation.[96] On some occasions this has been attributed to stage fright[97] and the influence of alcohol.[98] Marshall spoke openly about suffering from severe bouts of stage fright, specifically in her early career, and admitted that her stage fright stemmed from issues regarding depression, alcoholism, and substance abuse.[99]

In June 2012, it was reported that Marshall had ended her relationship with Ribisi, and the completion of her upcoming record had coincided with their breakup: "I cut my hair off three days [after the breakup], got on a plane to France, and finished the shit."[83] Shortly after the release of Sun, Marshall began having trouble breathing and was hospitalized multiple times, though doctors were unable to diagnose her. "I thought I was dying," she recounted. "They told me they were going to put me in a coma to save my lungs. My friend came to visit and told me I'd made the Billboard Top 10 and all I could think was: 'I don't want to die.'"[84] Marshall was subsequently diagnosed with hereditary angioedema, an immune disorder that causes sporadic swelling of the face and throat due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. In September 2012, she stated she had been hospitalized due to the condition over eight times, which led her to cancel her European tour.[85]

Marshall recordedsimultaneously her first two albums Dear Sir and Myra Lee in December 1994 in a small basement studio near Mott Street in New York City, with guitarist Tim Foljahn and Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley; Marshall and Shelley had initially met after she played a show opening for Liz Phair in 1993.[25][26] A total of 20 songs were recorded in a single day by the trio, all of which were split into two records, making up Dear Sir and Myra Lee, released respectively in October 1995 and March 1996.[27] Although Dear Sir is considered Marshall's debut album, it is more the length of an EP.

In February 2003, Marshall released You Are Free, her first album of original material in five years.[46] The album, which featured guest musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Dave Grohl, and Warren Ellis, became the first charting Cat Power album, reaching 105 on the Billboard 200. A music video directed by Brett Vapnek was released for the song "He War".Marshall toured extensively through 2003 and 2004, playing shows in Europe, Brazil, the U.S. and Australia.[22] During this period, Marshall's live performances had become erratic and unpredictable, and a 2003 The New Yorker article suggested: "It is foolhardy to describe a Cat Power event as a concert," citing "rambling confessions" and "[talking] to a friend's baby from the stage."[47] Marshall later attributed this period to a drinking problem.[48] Around the time of the release of You Are Free, Marshall purchased a house in South Beach, Miami.[23]

Marshall's releases as Cat Power have frequently been noted by critics for their somber, blues-influenced instrumentation and melancholy lyrics, leading LA Weekly to dub her the "queen of sadcore".[2] Marshall, however, claims her music is often misinterpreted, and that many of her songs are "not sad, [but] triumphant."[88] She has recounted blues, old soul music, British rock 'n' roll, as well as hymns and gospel music as being integral influences on her.[89]

With a progressive point of view and irreverent voice, the Chronicle covers local and state news as well as the Austin food, film, theater, art and music communities. The paper also has a number of annual features, including the 'Best of Austin' awards, cut-out masks for Halloween, the April Fools' edition, and the First Plates Restaurant Awards. The Chronicle produces the annual Austin Chronicle Hot Sauce Festival, normally held in late August.
Its precursor in style and format was the Austin Sun, a bi-weekly that had ceased operations in 1978, after four years of publication.[4] The first issue of the Chronicle was distributed on September 4, 1981.
The Chronicle was co-founded in 1981 by Nick Barbaro and Louis Black, with assistance from others who largely met through the graduate film studies program at the University of Texas at Austin. Barbaro and Black are also co-founders of the South by Southwest Festival, although the festival operates as a separate company.[3] The paper initially was published bi-weekly, and later weekly.
