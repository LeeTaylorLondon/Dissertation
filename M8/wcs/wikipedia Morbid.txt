Morbid was formed in Stockholm at the end of 1986.[2] With Per "Dead" Ohlin as the group's founder and leader, there was a number of members before the band settled on the line-up of John "John Lennart" Hagström, "TG" on guitars, Jens Näsström on bass and Lars-Göran Petrov on drums.[2] When "TG" left the band, he was replaced by Ulf Cederlund.[2] The band then recorded their debut demo, December Moon, at Thunderload Studios in Stockholm on 5 and 6 December 1987.[3] This was the only recording featuring this line-up, as Hagström quit and Ohlin left for Norway to join the black metal band Mayhem.[4] The remains of the band tried to carry on, and brought in photographer John Scarisbrick as a new vocalist.[4] Scarisbrick lived near a recording studio named Sunlight, which would later gain some notoriety in death metal circles,[4] recording bands like Entombed[5] and Dismember. It was there that the band recorded their last release,[6] a demo titled The Last Supper, in September 1988.[4] The band faded as Petrov and Cederlund started Nihilist,[6] which eventually turned into Entombed.[7] Näsström later continued in the bands Contras and Skull.

Although Morbid only officially released two demos, they gained a certain cult status after their break-up, in part likely to Ohlin's efforts with Mayhem. The demo recordings and various live and rehearsal tracks were later published on vinyl and CD, on official and bootleg releases. After Ohlin left the band to move to Kråkstad, he was replaced by the former singer, John Scarisbrick.

Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground
In an interview conducted by Marduk guitarist Morgan Håkansson, and published in the fanzine Slayer, Dead explained how he and the rest of Mayhem would expel poseurs at their concerts. Reciting the events of one particular show, he claimed "Before we began to play there was a crowd of about 300 in there, but in the second song 'Necrolust' we began to throw around those pig heads. Only 50 were left." He and the other members enjoyed this sort of practice; he concluded with"If someone doesn't like blood and rotten flesh thrown in their face they can FUCK OFF, and that's exactly what they do."[16]

Dead was known for his morbid personality and obsession with death. He hoarded dead birds, wore shirts with funeral announcements printed on them, and wore corpse paint—being one of the first in black metal to do so. Acquaintances and peers described Ohlin as difficult to befriend or understand. Already intensely introverted and depressed, Dead's personality and demeanor would only become more withdrawn leading up to his death, a progression marked by such patterns as harming himself offstage among friends and isolating himself for long periods in his bedroom.

For concerts, Dead went to great lengths to achieve the image and atmosphere he wished. From the beginning of his career, he wore "corpse paint", which involved covering his face with black and white makeup. According to Necrobutcher, "[i]t wasn't anything to do with the way Kiss and Alice Cooper used makeup. Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse. He didn't do it to look cool".[12] Hellhammer claimed that Dead "was the first black metal musician to use corpse paint",[13] although this statement has been proven to be debatable as Euronymous can be seen wearing corpse paint in live footage as early as 1985. To complete his corpse-like image, Dead would bury his stage clothes and dig them up again to wear on the night of a concert.[3][8] According to Hellhammer:

Dead committed suicide in April 1991 at the age of 22.[2] An image of his dead body was used as the cover of the bootleg live album The Dawn of the Black Hearts.[3][4][5] His death marked a turning point in the history of the Norwegian black metal scene, leading to a wave of erratic behavior by the scene's members.

Per Yngve "Pelle" Ohlin (16 January 1969 – 8 April 1991), better known by his stage name Dead, was a Swedish metal musician who was best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem from 1988 until his death in 1991. Prior to Mayhem, he also performed as vocalist in the Swedish death/thrash band Morbid. Dead was a popular figure of the Norwegian black metal scene, and his legacy persists in the genre to this day. Roadrunner Records ranked him No. 48 out of 50 of The Greatest Metal Front-Men of All Time.[1]
Originators of the Northern Darkness – A Tribute to Mayhem
As a teenager, he developed a taste for heavy metal and rock music, citing bands like Black Sabbath, Kiss, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, AC/DC, Motörhead, Venom, Metallica,Bathory, Sodom, and Mercyful Fate as his favorites.[9] Despite his love for Bathory, he was very displeased after their change in musical style, and consequently referred to Quorthon as "a wimp".[10]
Dead would cut himself while singing onstage. During a gig in Jessheim on February 3, 1990, he slashed his arm with a broken bottle. Faust claims that Dead had to be taken to hospital after the gig, but arrived too late and so "it was no use to give him stitches".[14][15]

Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's "evil" image and claimed Dead had killed himself because black metal had become "trendy" and commercialized.[30] Necrobutcher speculated that taking the pictures and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend's body.[8][12] After Hellhammer developed the photos, Euronymous initially promised to destroy them, but ultimately did not. He stored them in an envelope at his record shop Helvete and sent one to the owner of Warmaster Records[8] which resulted in its use as cover art for the bootleg live album The Dawn of the Black Hearts, which was released in 1995. The cover of Mayhem's Live in Leipzig contains part of Dead's suicide note: Jag är inte en människa. Det här är bara en dröm, och snart vaknar jag. (Roughly translated: I am not a human being. This is just a dream, and soon I will wake.)

In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a stew with bits of Dead's brain and had made necklaces with bits of his skull.[8][31] The band later denied the former rumor, but confirmed that the latter was true.[31] Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy,[32] which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like Bård "Faust" Eithun,[33] Metalion,[34] and Morgan Håkansson.[35]

In time, Dead's social situation and his fascination with death caused his mental state to worsen greatly. He would casually cut himself while in the presence of his friends, who would have to subdue him and patch him up.[8] Although this upset many of his friends, Euronymous grew fascinated with Dead's suicidal ideologies because he felt extreme negativity fit Mayhem's image—and according to them, he encouraged Dead to kill himself.[8][12] Manheim said: "I don't know if Øystein did it out of pure evil or if he was just fooling around."[8]

[Dead] wasn't a guy you could know very well. I think even the other guys in Mayhem didn't know him very well. He was hard to get close to. I met him two weeks before he died. I'd met him maybe six to eight times, in all. He had lots of weird ideas. I remember Aarseth was talking about him and said he did not have any humor. He did, but it was very obscure. Honestly, I don't think he was enjoying living in this world, which of course resulted in the suicide.[21]

Necrobutcher noted that "people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene".[36]

In interviews, fellow musicians often described Dead as odd and introverted. Mayhem drummer Jan Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg described Dead as "a very strange personality […] depressed, melancholic, and dark".[18] Likewise, Mayhem guitarist Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth once said, "I honestly think Dead is mentally insane. Which other way can you describe a guy who does not eat, in order to get starving wounds? Or who has a T-shirt with funeral announcements on it?"[19] Former Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim later likened Dead's personality to that of Marvin the Paranoid Android.[8] Some authors have speculated that Dead may have had Cotard delusion, a very rare condition that manifests in believing one's body is not that of a living human but instead a corpse; this theory is supported by a variety of statements from Dead on the subject of his blood and body.[20]

An obituary in a Swedish newspaper stated that Dead's funeral was held at Österhaninge kyrka (Eastern Haninge Church) on Friday 26 April 1991.[29] He was buried at Österhaninge begravningsplats (Eastern Haninge graveyard), located in Stockholm.
In early 1986, he founded the Swedish thrash/death metal group Morbid, with which he recorded a demo tape called December Moon. Disappointed that the band wasn't "going anywhere", he decided to contact members of Mayhem as he was aware the group were in need of a new frontman following vocalist Maniac's departure.[11] According to Mayhem bassist Jørn "Necrobutcher" Stubberud, Dead initially sent the band members a small parcel containing a demo tape, a letter detailing his ideas for the future, and a crucified mouse.[3][8] Although Necrobutcher lost the package itself, he kept the tape which had Dead's contact details. At that point, Dead moved to Norway in early 1988 and became the new official vocalist for Mayhem.[8]
According to a longtime pen pal of Ohlin known as "Old Nick", Ohlin disliked technology. He would only ever write letters to himself or others using longhand style, and would never resort to the use of a PC. Old Nick concluded "technology in general made him [feel] uncomfortable. He just rejected it altogether, finding refuge [instead] in a world made of forests and woodlands."[23] He also had an unusual interest with porphyria due to its connection to the mythology of vampirism.[23]

Per Ohlin (sometimes called "Pelle") was born on 16 January 1969 in Västerhaninge, Sweden to parents Anita Forsberg and Lars Ohlin, who divorced soon after his birth.[3] As a young child, he suffered from sleep apnea.[6] At the age of ten, he suffered internal bleeding when his spleen ruptured after what he claimed was an ice skating accident. However, in the Swedish metal book Blod eld död (English: "Blood Fire Death"), his brother Anders Ohlin stated in an exclusive interview that Dead was frequently bullied in school and one day sustained a ruptured spleen as a direct result of a severe beating by bullies.[7] Because of the injury, he had to be rushed to a hospital, where he was, for a time, declared clinically dead. After a few years, the incident resulted in a fascination with death, and later inspired his stage name.[3][8]

By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near Kråkstad, which was used as a place for the band to rehearse. According to Hellhammer, Dead spent much of his time writing letters and drawing. He "just sat in his room and became more and more depressed".[24] Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous "got on each other's nerves a lot".[3] Hellhammer recalls an anecdote where Dead once retreated outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous followed and began shooting into the air with a shotgun to further antagonize him.[24] Varg Vikernes of Burzum claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife during an altercation.[25] Vikernes also claims to have sent Mayhem ammunition, including shotgun shells, as a Christmas gift, although he claimed those were not the shells Dead used to kill himself, and that he instead saved a "special shell" particularly to be used for his suicide.[2][26]

Before the shows, Dead used to bury his clothes into the ground so that they could start to rot and get that grave scent. He was a corpse on a stage. Once he even asked us to bury him in the ground — he wanted his skin to become pale.[13]

Excuse the blood, but I have slit my wrists and neck. It was the intention that I would die in the woods so that it would take a few days before I was possibly found. I belong in the woods and have always done so. No one will understand the reason for this anyway. To give some semblance of an explanation I'm not a human, this is just a dream and soon I will wake. It was too cold and the blood kept clotting, plus the new knife is too dull. If I don't succeed dying to the knife I will blow all the shit out of my skull. Yet I do not know. I left all my lyrics by "Let the good times roll"—plus the rest of the money. Whoever finds it gets the fucking thing. As a last salutation may I present "Life Eternal". Do whatever you want with it. / Pelle.I didn't come up with this now, but seventeen years ago.[7]
During one tour with Mayhem, he found a dead crow and kept it in a plastic bag. He often carried it about with him and would smell the bird before going onstage, to sing "with the stench of death in his nostrils."[12] He would also collect dead geese, and keep them underneath his bed.[3][8]

In an interview conducted by Marduk guitarist Morgan Håkansson, and published in the fanzine Slayer, Dead explained how he and the rest of Mayhem would expel poseurs at their concerts. Reciting the events of one particular show, he claimed "Before we began to play there was a crowd of about 300 in there, but in the second song 'Necrolust' we began to throw around those pig heads. Only 50 were left." He and the other members enjoyed this sort of practice; he concluded with"If someone doesn't like blood and rotten flesh thrown in their face they can FUCK OFF, and that's exactly what they do."[16]

Dead was known for his morbid personality and obsession with death. He hoarded dead birds, wore shirts with funeral announcements printed on them, and wore corpse paint—being one of the first in black metal to do so. Acquaintances and peers described Ohlin as difficult to befriend or understand. Already intensely introverted and depressed, Dead's personality and demeanor would only become more withdrawn leading up to his death, a progression marked by such patterns as harming himself offstage among friends and isolating himself for long periods in his bedroom.

For concerts, Dead went to great lengths to achieve the image and atmosphere he wished. From the beginning of his career, he wore "corpse paint", which involved covering his face with black and white makeup. According to Necrobutcher, "[i]t wasn't anything to do with the way Kiss and Alice Cooper used makeup. Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse. He didn't do it to look cool".[12] Hellhammer claimed that Dead "was the first black metal musician to use corpse paint",[13] although this statement has been proven to be debatable as Euronymous can be seen wearing corpse paint in live footage as early as 1985. To complete his corpse-like image, Dead would bury his stage clothes and dig them up again to wear on the night of a concert.[3][8] According to Hellhammer:

Dead committed suicide in April 1991 at the age of 22.[2] An image of his dead body was used as the cover of the bootleg live album The Dawn of the Black Hearts.[3][4][5] His death marked a turning point in the history of the Norwegian black metal scene, leading to a wave of erratic behavior by the scene's members.

Per Yngve "Pelle" Ohlin (16 January 1969 – 8 April 1991), better known by his stage name Dead, was a Swedish metal musician who was best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem from 1988 until his death in 1991. Prior to Mayhem, he also performed as vocalist in the Swedish death/thrash band Morbid. Dead was a popular figure of the Norwegian black metal scene, and his legacy persists in the genre to this day. Roadrunner Records ranked him No. 48 out of 50 of The Greatest Metal Front-Men of All Time.[1]

As a teenager, he developed a taste for heavy metal and rock music, citing bands like Black Sabbath, Kiss, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, AC/DC, Motörhead, Venom, Metallica,Bathory, Sodom, and Mercyful Fate as his favorites.[9] Despite his love for Bathory, he was very displeased after their change in musical style, and consequently referred to Quorthon as "a wimp".[10]
Dead would cut himself while singing onstage. During a gig in Jessheim on February 3, 1990, he slashed his arm with a broken bottle. Faust claims that Dead had to be taken to hospital after the gig, but arrived too late and so "it was no use to give him stitches".[14][15]

Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's "evil" image and claimed Dead had killed himself because black metal had become "trendy" and commercialized.[30] Necrobutcher speculated that taking the pictures and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend's body.[8][12] After Hellhammer developed the photos, Euronymous initially promised to destroy them, but ultimately did not. He stored them in an envelope at his record shop Helvete and sent one to the owner of Warmaster Records[8] which resulted in its use as cover art for the bootleg live album The Dawn of the Black Hearts, which was released in 1995. The cover of Mayhem's Live in Leipzig contains part of Dead's suicide note: Jag är inte en människa. Det här är bara en dröm, och snart vaknar jag. (Roughly translated: I am not a human being. This is just a dream, and soon I will wake.)

In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a stew with bits of Dead's brain and had made necklaces with bits of his skull.[8][31] The band later denied the former rumor, but confirmed that the latter was true.[31] Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy,[32] which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like Bård "Faust" Eithun,[33] Metalion,[34] and Morgan Håkansson.[35]

In time, Dead's social situation and his fascination with death caused his mental state to worsen greatly. He would casually cut himself while in the presence of his friends, who would have to subdue him and patch him up.[8] Although this upset many of his friends, Euronymous grew fascinated with Dead's suicidal ideologies because he felt extreme negativity fit Mayhem's image—and according to them, he encouraged Dead to kill himself.[8][12] Manheim said: "I don't know if Øystein did it out of pure evil or if he was just fooling around."[8]

[Dead] wasn't a guy you could know very well. I think even the other guys in Mayhem didn't know him very well. He was hard to get close to. I met him two weeks before he died. I'd met him maybe six to eight times, in all. He had lots of weird ideas. I remember Aarseth was talking about him and said he did not have any humor. He did, but it was very obscure. Honestly, I don't think he was enjoying living in this world, which of course resulted in the suicide.[21]

Necrobutcher noted that "people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene".[36]

In interviews, fellow musicians often described Dead as odd and introverted. Mayhem drummer Jan Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg described Dead as "a very strange personality […] depressed, melancholic, and dark".[18] Likewise, Mayhem guitarist Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth once said, "I honestly think Dead is mentally insane. Which other way can you describe a guy who does not eat, in order to get starving wounds? Or who has a T-shirt with funeral announcements on it?"[19] Former Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim later likened Dead's personality to that of Marvin the Paranoid Android.[8] Some authors have speculated that Dead may have had Cotard delusion, a very rare condition that manifests in believing one's body is not that of a living human but instead a corpse; this theory is supported by a variety of statements from Dead on the subject of his blood and body.[20]

An obituary in a Swedish newspaper stated that Dead's funeral was held at Österhaninge kyrka (Eastern Haninge Church) on Friday 26 April 1991.[29] He was buried at Österhaninge begravningsplats (Eastern Haninge graveyard), located in Stockholm.
In early 1986, he founded the Swedish thrash/death metal group Morbid, with which he recorded a demo tape called December Moon. Disappointed that the band wasn't "going anywhere", he decided to contact members of Mayhem as he was aware the group were in need of a new frontman following vocalist Maniac's departure.[11] According to Mayhem bassist Jørn "Necrobutcher" Stubberud, Dead initially sent the band members a small parcel containing a demo tape, a letter detailing his ideas for the future, and a crucified mouse.[3][8] Although Necrobutcher lost the package itself, he kept the tape which had Dead's contact details. At that point, Dead moved to Norway in early 1988 and became the new official vocalist for Mayhem.[8]
According to a longtime pen pal of Ohlin known as "Old Nick", Ohlin disliked technology. He would only ever write letters to himself or others using longhand style, and would never resort to the use of a PC. Old Nick concluded "technology in general made him [feel] uncomfortable. He just rejected it altogether, finding refuge [instead] in a world made of forests and woodlands."[23] He also had an unusual interest with porphyria due to its connection to the mythology of vampirism.[23]

Per Ohlin (sometimes called "Pelle") was born on 16 January 1969 in Västerhaninge, Sweden to parents Anita Forsberg and Lars Ohlin, who divorced soon after his birth.[3] As a young child, he suffered from sleep apnea.[6] At the age of ten, he suffered internal bleeding when his spleen ruptured after what he claimed was an ice skating accident. However, in the Swedish metal book Blod eld död (English: "Blood Fire Death"), his brother Anders Ohlin stated in an exclusive interview that Dead was frequently bullied in school and one day sustained a ruptured spleen as a direct result of a severe beating by bullies.[7] Because of the injury, he had to be rushed to a hospital, where he was, for a time, declared clinically dead. After a few years, the incident resulted in a fascination with death, and later inspired his stage name.[3][8]

By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near Kråkstad, which was used as a place for the band to rehearse. According to Hellhammer, Dead spent much of his time writing letters and drawing. He "just sat in his room and became more and more depressed".[24] Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous "got on each other's nerves a lot".[3] Hellhammer recalls an anecdote where Dead once retreated outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous followed and began shooting into the air with a shotgun to further antagonize him.[24] Varg Vikernes of Burzum claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife during an altercation.[25] Vikernes also claims to have sent Mayhem ammunition, including shotgun shells, as a Christmas gift, although he claimed those were not the shells Dead used to kill himself, and that he instead saved a "special shell" particularly to be used for his suicide.[2][26]

Before the shows, Dead used to bury his clothes into the ground so that they could start to rot and get that grave scent. He was a corpse on a stage. Once he even asked us to bury him in the ground — he wanted his skin to become pale.[13]

Excuse the blood, but I have slit my wrists and neck. It was the intention that I would die in the woods so that it would take a few days before I was possibly found. I belong in the woods and have always done so. No one will understand the reason for this anyway. To give some semblance of an explanation I'm not a human, this is just a dream and soon I will wake. It was too cold and the blood kept clotting, plus the new knife is too dull. If I don't succeed dying to the knife I will blow all the shit out of my skull. Yet I do not know. I left all my lyrics by "Let the good times roll"—plus the rest of the money. Whoever finds it gets the fucking thing. As a last salutation may I present "Life Eternal". Do whatever you want with it. / Pelle.I didn't come up with this now, but seventeen years ago.[7]
During one tour with Mayhem, he found a dead crow and kept it in a plastic bag. He often carried it about with him and would smell the bird before going onstage, to sing "with the stench of death in his nostrils."[12] He would also collect dead geese, and keep them underneath his bed.[3][8]

Nihilist was a Swedish death metal band formed in 1987[1] by Nicke Andersson and Alex Hellid.[2] The band split up in 1989 when Johnny Hedlund left to form Unleashed.[1] The remaining members reformed the band under the name Entombed.[1] Nihilist never recorded a full-length album before they renamed themselves Entombed, but a collection of their demo work was released in 2005.[3] Guitarist Leif "Leffe" Cuzner died in June 2006.[4]
Nicke Andersson admitted in the recent book about the history of death metal and grindcore Choosing Death that after his relationship with Johnny Hedlund had grown ever more acrimonious, he had deliberately split the band up as a means of parting company with him.

The label's most popular band is Lacuna Coil.[citation needed] Shadows Fall experienced its greatest success during its time with the label. Iconic hardcore punk band Sick of It All also resides in the Century Media family. Lacuna Coil's 2002 album, Comalies, became Century Media's first act to crack the Billboard 200 album chart, peaking at No. 178 two years after its release. Their fourth album, Karmacode, improved on that achievement, having sold over 490,000 copies since its release, and peaking at No. 28 on the US Billboard Album Chart. It hit number one on the Top Independent Albums Chart. Shadows Fall's 2004 album, The War Within, set a new milestone for the label with a Top 20 debut on the Billboard 200 and also debuted at number one on the Independent Albums chart, having sold over 300,000 copies since its release. Other notable artists on the label that have also made appearances on the Billboard 200 include In This Moment, Arch Enemy, Stuck Mojo, Nightrage, Behemoth, Strapping Young Lad, Suicide Silence and God Forbid. The Finnish metal band Sentenced were awarded on August 14, 2008 for their platinum Buried Alive live DVD labelled by Century Media. In April 2009, the label announced that they were extending their existing distribution deal with EMI, who had been distributing their releases in the United States since 1997, and in Europe since 2005, to include Australasia. Since being bought out by Sony Music in August 2015, the label's releases will be distributed worldwide by Sony Music while RED will be distributing the label's releases in the U.S.[3]

Robert Kampf was quoted on his new label: Twenty five years after starting Century Media the excitement to do another version of the label could not be any larger. My undying love for rock has driven the formation of this label ANOTHER CENTURY. Over the years great bands like Otherwise and In This Moment have been released on Century Media but sometimes got lost or felt ill mixed among some of the heavier CM bands. Another Century now has a clear path and mission statement: To develop and break the best bands in rock to come![6]
"Is this the next big major label acquisition? - Music Business Worldwide"
In late 2014 Robert Kampf, founder of Century Media Records, launched a new hard rock-focused label named Another Century. This label is leaning away from straight-up metal of Century Media and looking to make a name for itself as a premiere hard rock label. Kampf, who started Century Media Records back in 1988, said in a statement that it's his, “undying love for rock” that led to the formation of the new label, and he hopes to, “develop and break the best bands in rock.”[5]

During the mid to late 1990s, Century Media had an imprint called Century Black which served as "the Miramax Films of black metal", releasing or re-releasing hard-to-find foreign black metal albums, which normally would have been nearly impossible to find in America. Usually, those records had been released by smaller European labels, such as Malicious Records or Candlelight Records. Century Black was founded by Rayshele Teige, who also acted as A&R for Century Black and had been a publicist for Century Media Records.[8][9] Teige was also in charge of the American distribution arm for Osmose Productions and later went on to spearhead the American office for Prophecy Productions. By 2000, the Century Black imprint was discontinued as several of its bands had signed with other American metal record labels, or had signed deals with Century Media Records and became part of the "Century Family".

Hellid, Andersson and Cederlund reunited to perform as Entombed in October 2016. They were joined by Robert Andersson (vocals) and Nicke Andersson's half brother Edvin Aftonfalk (bass), both formerly of the Swedish death metal band Morbus Chron. Their first performance was at the Close-Up Båten festival cruise. In November they performed a double set in Malmö to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Clandestine, where the album was performed in its entirety twice. The first set was a performance by Hellid, Cederlund, Andersson with Säfström and von Wachenfeldt and the Malmö Symphony Orchestra and the second set was a regular performance with Andersson and Aftonfalk.[16]
Entombed's debut album Left Hand Path was released in 1990,[4] a cult favorite that established them as a popular Swedish death metal band.[6] Left Hand Path and its follow-up, Clandestine,[4] were unique in that they featured what was sometimes referred to as a "buzz saw" guitar sound.[6] Prior to the recording of Clandestine, Petrov was fired from the band due to personal disputes.[4] The vocals on the album were recorded by Andersson instead, and for the tour following the album's release in 1991, the band hired vocalist Johnny Dordevic, previously a member of the band Carnage.[7]

Petrov eventually reconciled with the band after releasing an album with the band Comecon, and the band eventually released Wolverine Blues in 1993.[4] The album featured a departure of sound from the band's previous work, with a greater influence of hard rock and heavy metal alongside their initial death metal stylings, in a style now often referred to as death 'n' roll.[8][9] Although the release was divisive amongst the band's fanbase, it established their mainstream and critical reputation.[10] Wolverine Blues is considered a classic of early 1990s death metal.[10]

Entombed is a Swedish death metal band formed in 1987 under the name of Nihilist. Entombed began their career as an early pioneer of Scandinavian death metal which initially differed from its American counterpart by its distinct "buzzsaw" guitar tone. However, by the early 1990s their sound had broadened to include garage rock and other influences. This new style would eventually be described as death 'n' roll. Entombed has been influenced by bands such as Slayer, Exodus, Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, Autopsy, Repulsion, Kiss, The Misfits, Motörhead, Discharge, Death and Testament.[1][2] Along with Dismember, Grave and Unleashed, Entombed has been referred to as one of the "big four" of Swedish death metal.[3]
Hellid, Cederlund, and Säfström reunited to perform "Clandestine" in its entirety with the 65-piece Gävle Symphonic Orchestra and a 40-piece choir in February 2014. Thomas von Wachenfeldt played bass.[15] Nicke Andersson intended to participate, but was prevented by scheduling conflicts.

Entombed are rooted in the band Nihilist who were formed by drummer Nicke Andersson, guitarist Alex Hellid and bassist Leif Cuzner, who formed the band in 1987.[4] After using a number of temporary vocalists for their initial shows, the band eventually recruited L.G. Petrov,[4] who was the drummer for the band Morbid, which featured Mayhem vocalist Dead. The band also recruited Morbid's session guitarist Uffe Cederlund as a second guitarist, and recorded a number of demos with tracks that would eventually appear on Entombed's debut album.[4] Following increased tensions between band members, the majority of the band decided to rename themselves as Entombed rather than force these members out.[5]
1998's Same Difference was the band's first album without drummer and founding member Nicke Andersson, who left the band to concentrate on his new project The Hellacopters.[11] He was replaced by Peter Stjärnvind.[11] In 2000, Entombed released Uprising,[11] followed a year later by Morning Star.[12]
In 2010, Victor Brandt joined as bass player and Nico Elgstrand switched to guitars so the band once again had two guitarists.

Morbid was formed in Stockholm at the end of 1986.[2] With Per "Dead" Ohlin as the group's founder and leader, there was a number of members before the band settled on the line-up of John "John Lennart" Hagström, "TG" on guitars, Jens Näsström on bass and Lars-Göran Petrov on drums.[2] When "TG" left the band, he was replaced by Ulf Cederlund.[2] The band then recorded their debut demo, December Moon, at Thunderload Studios in Stockholm on 5 and 6 December 1987.[3] This was the only recording featuring this line-up, as Hagström quit and Ohlin left for Norway to join the black metal band Mayhem.[4] The remains of the band tried to carry on, and brought in photographer John Scarisbrick as a new vocalist.[4] Scarisbrick lived near a recording studio named Sunlight, which would later gain some notoriety in death metal circles,[4] recording bands like Entombed[5] and Dismember. It was there that the band recorded their last release,[6] a demo titled The Last Supper, in September 1988.[4] The band faded as Petrov and Cederlund started Nihilist,[6] which eventually turned into Entombed.[7] Näsström later continued in the bands Contras and Skull.

Although Morbid only officially released two demos, they gained a certain cult status after their break-up, in part likely to Ohlin's efforts with Mayhem. The demo recordings and various live and rehearsal tracks were later published on vinyl and CD, on official and bootleg releases. After Ohlin left the band to move to Kråkstad, he was replaced by the former singer, John Scarisbrick.
Sunlight Studios is a recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden which is run by Tomas Skogsberg.
