A collection of molecules forming a gas can be considered in an excited state if one or more molecules are elevated to kinetic energy levels such that the resulting velocity distribution departs from the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. This phenomenon has been studied in the case of a two-dimensional gas in some detail, analyzing the time taken to relax to equilibrium.
An atom in a high excited state is termed a Rydberg atom. A system of highly excited atoms can form a long-lived condensed excited state e.g. a condensed phase made completely of excited atoms: Rydberg matter.

The lifetime of a system in an excited state is usually short: spontaneous or induced emission of a quantum of energy (such as a photon or a phonon) usually occurs shortly after the system is promoted to the excited state, returning the system to a state with lower energy (a less excited state or the ground state). This return to a lower energy level is often loosely described as decay and is the inverse of excitation.
After excitation the atom may return to the ground state or a lower excited state, by emitting a photon with a characteristic energy. Emission of photons from atoms in various excited states leads to an electromagnetic spectrum showing a series of characteristic emission lines (including, in the case of the hydrogen atom, the Lyman, Balmer, Paschen and Brackett series).

The excitation of a system (an atom or molecule) from one excited state to a higher-energy excited state with the absorption of a photon is called excited-state absorption (ESA). Excited-state absorption is possible only when an electron has been already excited from the ground state to a lower excited state. The excited-state absorption is usually an undesired effect, but it can be useful in upconversion pumping.[8] Excited-state absorption measurements are done using pump–probe techniques such as flash photolysis. However, it is not easy to measure them compared to ground-state absorption, and in some cases complete bleaching of the ground state is required to measure excited-state absorption.[9]

In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation refers to an increase in energy level above a chosen starting point, usually the ground state, but sometimes an already excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature).

The ground state of the hydrogen atom corresponds to having the atom's single electron in the lowest possible orbital (that is, the spherically symmetric "1s" wave function, which, so far, has demonstrated to have the lowest possible quantum numbers). By giving the atom additional energy (for example, by the absorption of a photon of an appropriate energy), the electron is able to move into an excited state (one with one or more quantum numbers greater than the minimum possible). If the photon has too much energy, the electron will cease to be bound to the atom, and the atom will become ionized.

Atoms can be excited by heat, electricity, or light. A simple example of this concept comes by considering the hydrogen atom.

Excited states are often calculated using coupled cluster, Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, multi-configurational self-consistent field, configuration interaction,[1] and time-dependent density functional theory.[2][3][4][5][6][7]
A further consequence of excited-state formation may be reaction of the atom or molecule in its excited state, as in photochemistry.

Excited state, an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state
Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "Few dance/pop albums are as consistently potent as this band's US debut, Elegant Slumming. On its third, top 40 offering, singer Heather Small bounces over a lively, Philly soul-influenced groove with a performance that is, by turns, giddy and hearty. Programmers with a savvy musical ear will feast on the cut's brassy horn flourishes and rollicking piano lines. Meanwhile, dancefloor enthusiasts will subscribe to the bass intensity and percolating breaks."[2] A reviewer from Lennox Herald described "Excited" as a "very open and spacious dance track with classy vocal."[3] Ian Gittins from Melody Maker opined that the band are let down "by seriously lame'n'lazy lyrics".[4] Alan Jones from Music Week felt that here, M People are "operating at the more sophisticated end of the dance music spectrum."[5] John Kilgo from The Network Forty declared the song as "an uptempo jammer".[6]

When the single was released it sold in excess of 27,000 copies in its first week to enter the chart at 30, after their second Top of the Pops appearance the single sold slightly more (29,000 copies) to climb one place to its peak position of 29, equalling the peak position of the parent album's first single: "How Can I Love You More?" became their fourth consecutive Top 40 hit and second top thirty hit.
In the US video, filmed in the summer of 1994, in between the 2nd and 3rd albums (Elegant Slumming and Bizarre Fruit). It features all members of the band, including Bizarre Fruit musicians: Andy Gangadeen on drums, backing vocalists Paul Johnson and Lynieve Austin and Percussionist Shovel, who at this point had become full member. Paul Heard plays keyboards and Mike Pickering on saxophone.

After three Top 40 hits, where each single had charted lower than the one before, M People went back into the studio to record some new tracks for a 1992 re-release of their debut album. Two tracks, "Excited" and "Man Smart", were chosen to replace the outgoing "Life" and "Platini". The band planned to release a revised track listing as well, and the track "Excited" was to be the opener, with its fresher, more fun sound. They were looking for a track that would take them from the underground to a more widespread and populist audience as the 1991 version of the album had only charted in the lower echelons of the chart.

"Excited" is a song by British band M People, released in September 1992 as the fourth and final single from their first album, Northern Soul (1991). The song was written by bandmembers Mike Pickering and Paul Heard, and peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart and number four on the UK Dance Singles Chart. There were produced two different music videos for the single release.
There are two music videos for the single, one for the UK and one for the US.
The band are all seen performing at an indoor LA Pool party from the side of the pool, meanwhile party revellers are dancing round the pool’s edge. Halfway through the song and leading towards the middle eight of “You and me, so Excited”, the revellers start to jump into the pool one by one and continue to have fun. The band plays on getting splashed by water but continue playing happily. The video through also has a gold hue throughout the pool -side video.

The artwork of the CD single is simply 16 differently shaded red rectangles laid out in a 4 x 4 pattern with two of the boxes coloured a starkly bright yellow. The name of the single is in white font on a black banner with a smaller signature Red Rose (last seen on previous single Someday) to the top centre left.
The song stayed in the Top 40 for three weeks, climbing from its entry position of 30 up to 29 and back down to 35 in its third week. For the final two weeks the single slid down to 53 and then, finally, to 74.
The UK album artwork is slightly different with the same 16 differently shaded red rectangles laid out in a 4 x 4 pattern but two of the yellow boxes are in a different arrangement and the black title banner across the top.
The UK video was filmed in the summer of 1992, once the band had been in the studio to record Man Smart and Excited. And features Heather with her hair tied up, for the first time in two different poses. Primarily she wears a grey trouser suit over a black vest, the other scenes she sings from a red chaise longue, wearing a purple suede figure-hugging gown, surrounded by flowers, and her face is decorated with small white beads around her eyes. Throughout the video there are shots and silhouettes of Mike Pickering and Paul Heard all getting photographed together; Heather is seen performing separately.
The US artwork also has the same 16 differently shaded red rectangles laid out in a 4 x 4 pattern but two of the yellow boxes are in a different arrangement; one in the bottom right corner on the 12-inch/bottom centre right on the CD single) the other is mid-centre right above the centre banner and contains an image of the Elegant Slumming album cover sofa portrait featuring Mike, Paul and Shovel – as the single featured on the US version of that album.

The excitation of a system (an atom or molecule) from one excited state to a higher-energy excited state with the absorption of a photon is called excited-state absorption (ESA). Excited-state absorption is possible only when an electron has been already excited from the ground state to a lower excited state. The excited-state absorption is usually an undesired effect, but it can be useful in upconversion pumping.[8] Excited-state absorption measurements are done using pump–probe techniques such as flash photolysis. However, it is not easy to measure them compared to ground-state absorption, and in some cases complete bleaching of the ground state is required to measure excited-state absorption.[9]

In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation refers to an increase in energy level above a chosen starting point, usually the ground state, but sometimes an already excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature).

The ground state of the hydrogen atom corresponds to having the atom's single electron in the lowest possible orbital (that is, the spherically symmetric "1s" wave function, which, so far, has demonstrated to have the lowest possible quantum numbers). By giving the atom additional energy (for example, by the absorption of a photon of an appropriate energy), the electron is able to move into an excited state (one with one or more quantum numbers greater than the minimum possible). If the photon has too much energy, the electron will cease to be bound to the atom, and the atom will become ionized.

Atoms can be excited by heat, electricity, or light. A simple example of this concept comes by considering the hydrogen atom.

Excited states are often calculated using coupled cluster, Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, multi-configurational self-consistent field, configuration interaction,[1] and time-dependent density functional theory.[2][3][4][5][6][7]
A further consequence of excited-state formation may be reaction of the atom or molecule in its excited state, as in photochemistry.

The Oz Music Project felt that it was "a catchy-enough song, with menacing guitars crunching in each ear. However, central to the equation are Steele’s impish vocals. Without her singing – pushed to its limits, thin in the high registers, but always communicative – the song would be a generic grunge-lite song."[5]

"Excited" is the third single from Australian indie rock band Little Birdy's debut album, BigBigLove, released on 18 April 2005.[1] It was produced by Paul McKercher at Big Jesus Burger Studios, and mixed at Studios 301.[2]
Carmine Pascuzzi at Mediasearch considers that Katy Steele's vocals "could be something of an acquired taste" she has "admired the tenacious way in which they deliver their music." In her review of the single she stated "they impress again with ‘Excited’. It’s slightly darker than some of their previously sweeter tracks. The extra depth allows Katy’s vocals to expand into a soaring escape."[4]

Excited is a 2009 Canadian romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Vancouver-based director Bruce Sweeney and produced by Catherine Middleton and Bruce Sweeney.[1] It has screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, the Vancouver International Film Festival, the Palm Springs International Film Festival and the Seattle International Film Festival. It was given a theatrical release with Union Pictures.
Although a successful business-owner of a golf-course, Kevin hasn't been on a date in eight years much to the dismay of his mother (Gabrielle Rose), who is desperate for grandchildren. Unbeknownst to her, Kevin suffers from PE - premature ejaculation, which is the reason for his divorce and lack of love. When he is set up with Hayaam, the over-educated shoe sales clerk, it seems like a match made in heaven, until Kevin's sexual problem stands in the way. With medical help, and patience from Hayaam, it looks like things could work out until Kevin discovers Hayaam can't bear children. Finally Kevin must decide if his own needs are more important than his family's if he's going to truly find love.
