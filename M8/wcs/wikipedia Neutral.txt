At this critical juncture Sir Walter returns, having travelled home clandestinely, risking arrest for debt. Learning about the surrender of the mortgage, he assumes the worst and challenges Fitzavarice to a duel. The Lord accepts, but his second, a follower named Confident Rapture, arranges for the Captain to be apprehended for debt and so save his master the risks of single combat. Fitzavarice, however, pays the Captain's remaining debts and arranges for his release from prison. Peregrine now realizes his error and accepts his wife's virtue; but when he attempts to reconcile with Fitzavarice, the Lord refuses him, and insists that they meet on the "field of honor." When both are wounded in their combat, the demands of honor are satisfied; the two men become friends.

The Example is a Caroline era stage play, a comedy written by James Shirley, first published in 1637. The play has repeatedly been acclaimed both as one of Shirley's best comedies and one of the best works of its generation.[1] And it provides one of the clearest demonstrations in Shirley's canon of the influence of the works of Ben Jonson on the younger dramatist's output.[2]
The drama portrays a profligate lord named Fitzavarice, and his involvement with Sir Walter Peregrine and his wife. Pressed by massive debts, especially to Lord Fitzavarice, Sir Walter takes up soldiering and becomes a captain. While Captain Peregrine is absent on his military service, Fitzavarice attempts to seduce Mistress Peregrine, offering to discharge her husband's debts if she submits to him. She resists his importunities, and faints when he tries to force her. Guilt and embarrassment work a reformation on him: Fitzavarice presents her with the mortgage, and adds a precious jewel in admiration of her steadfastness.
The third-level plot concerns the uncle of Mistress Peregrine and Jacinta, Sir Solitary Plot, "a character compounded of Jonson's Morose in Epicene and Jonson's Sir Politic Would-Be in Volpone."[4] The result is an interesting study of paranoia in a 17th-century context: Sir Solitary sees enemies everywhere, and hides in his residence for safety. His servants Dormant and Oldrat are similar Jonsonian "humors" characters. Sir Solitary is jolted out of his obsession by a real but beneficent plot, engineered by Jacinta.
The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 24 June 1634. Like the majority of Shirley's plays, The Example was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre. The 1637 quarto was printed by John Norton for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke, the stationers who issued five plays by Shirley in that year alone. The quarto shows signs of having been printed from the author's working drafts or "foul papers," making it highly unusual among the early printed editions of Shirley's plays.[3]

The Austin Chronicle called the album "a great approximation of early R.E.M. that would fit nicely in a set with the Gin Blossoms, Toad the Wet Sprocket, and Sponge."[12] Trouser Press wrote that Example shows "that [the band] was a vibrant musical force with a fully realized sound and a knack for explosive, out-of-the-ordinary dynamics."[13]
Travis Tooke and Jack Griego would form a new band, Subrosa.[10] They released an album, Never Bet the Devil Your Head, in 1997.[11]

Example is the second studio album released by For Squirrels.[6][7] It was produced by Nick Launay. It was For Squirrels' only major label record, as lead singer John Vigliatura and bassist Bill White died when the band's van blew a tire and crashed less than a month before their upcoming album's release.[5]

In 2012, in the company of sister ships Explorer, Ranger and Trumpeter, Example undertook a 12-week deployment visiting Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany before transiting the Kiel Canal and attending Kiel Week. The deployment continued to Stockholm, St Petersburg and Tallinn before returning to the UK.[4]
The ship played a prominent role in the 2004 Entente Cordiale celebrations, and escorted HMS Endurance in the 2005 International Fleet Review. In summer 2006 the ship celebrated its 21st birthday with divisions at HMS Calliope with the salute taken by N Sherlock, Lord Lieutenant of Tyne and Wear. In 2008, Example took a prominent role in the Tyneside celebrations to mark the centenary of the Territorial Army centred on the Gateshead Millennium Bridge.[6]

Example and her sisters were transferred to the Royal Navy when the RNXS disbanded in 1994. She retained her existing name, but was reclassified as a patrol boat of the Archer class, and was given the new pennant number of P165.[1]
HMS Example is currently part of the Coastal Forces Squadron, formerly 1st Patrol Boat Squadron.[3] The mission statement of the CFS is to "provide support to allow the conduct of safe and effective P2000 operations in support of the URNU sea-training syllabus"; URNU is acronym for University Royal Naval Unit. Example is attached to the Northumbrian URNU, is based at the shore establishment HMS Calliope in Gateshead, and has a crew of 5 (plus up to 12 students).[1][4]

In November 2016, Example rejoined the fleet after a prolonged refit during which she received new engines allowing the ship to reach speeds of up to 22 knots (41 km/h).[7]

Example was built by Watercraft Ltd of Shoreham by Sea and launched in 1985. She was initially delivered to the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service (RNXS) as an auxiliary service vessel with the pennant number A153. She was the lead vessel of a batch of four vessels known as the Example class, but was identical in design to the Archer class of patrol boats being simultaneously built for the Royal Navy.[1]

HMS Example is an Archer-class patrol and training vessel of the Royal Navy, based at HMS Calliope in Gateshead, England. Example was originally built for the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, and was transferred to the Royal Navy when the RNXS disbanded in 1994. On transfer, she retained her name, and became the first ship in the Royal Navy to bear that name.[2]
Example acts as a training ship for students at Durham, Newcastle, Northumbria, Teesside and Sunderland universities. The ship takes part in deployments over the university summer and Easter holidays, giving the students an opportunity to spend a longer amount of time living on board the ship and to experience larger scale naval operations with other URNUs.[5]

The play of The Example won the 'Best Dramatic Writing' Award and others in the 2005 Shift and Sweet competition.Tom Taylor and Colin Wilson began adapting the play into comic book form in 2007. Gestalt Publishing published The Example in 2009. It was optioned by Bravada Films in 2010.
"The Example, a story about a man, a woman and their reactions to an abandoned briefcase on a railway platform, was first performed at Melbourne's Short and Sweet play competition in 2005, where it won first prize. It has since been performed across Australia, in the US, Singapore and Britain, including at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The play, with its humorous meditation on terrorism, paranoia and personal responsibility, also has been taught in schools and universities.

The action never leaves the confines of the platform and the characters don't do anything dramatic, yet the work is full of suspense. The image of the briefcase sits at the centre of the nine-frame grid, growing slightly larger with each turning page. [2]"

In a 2012 interview with The Guardian, he was stated to have Asperger syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. He said "I was diagnosed with Asperger's when I was younger. I was amazing with numbers, I had a photographic memory, and I hated reading fiction, preferring books on nature and history. All symptoms of mild autism."[16] He referenced this in the opening track to his fourth album The Evolution of Man, “Come Taste the Rainbow”. He has a younger sister, named Elise. He later went on to attend ADT College (now Ashcroft Technology Academy) in Putney. Example has claimed in interviews that the main reason he started rapping was due to his introduction to hip-hop through albums by Wu-Tang Clan and Snoop Dogg – the latter's album purchased primarily for "the cool cover art", and to the fact that he was not particularly good at any sports, so started rapping to fit in socially. His first experience of rapping was through a rap battle at a house party in Shepherd's Bush in 1994, when he was 12 years old. In that battle, he, in his own words, "completely destroyed a useless wanker and a fight broke out so (he) sprinted home".

The second-level domain label example for the top-level domains com, net, and org have been reserved and registered since at least 1992.[2] The IETF established the authority of this use in publication RFC 2606 in 1999.[3] The reservation for the educational domain edu was sponsored by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in 2000.

In 2013, the status and purpose of the domains was restated as belonging to a group of special-use domain names in RFC 6761.[4]

^ RFC 6761, S. Cheshire, M. Krochmal, Special-Use Domain Names, IETF (February 2013)
The zone files of each domain also define one subdomain name. The third-level domain name www resolves to the IP addresses of the parent domains.
In practice, these domain names are also installed in the Domain Name System with the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6 of a web server managed by ICANN. The domains are digitally signed using Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).
The domains example.com, example.net, example.org, and example.edu are intended for general use in any kind of documentation, such as technical and software documentation, manuals, and sample software configurations. Thus, documentation writers can be sure to select a domain name without creating naming conflicts if end-users try to use the sample configurations or examples verbatim. The domains may be used in documentation without prior consultation with IANA or ICANN.
