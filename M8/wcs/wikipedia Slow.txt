Carlton Hylton (born 1974), better known as Ghost, is a Jamaican singjay performer. He is best known for songs such as the dancehall hit "Body Guard". He gained his first notice in 1993 singing for Clifton "Specialist" Dillon on ragga songs, partnering with DJ Culture as rapper. Ghost was a member of Monster Shack Crew in 1996. He joined Jamaican singer Tony Curtis on 1997's "Wine", produced by Classical People for Opera House Production. In 1998 he wrote "What Have You Done" with Anthony Cameron, released as a single produced by Red Rose & Malvo during sessions for their compilation album How You Fi Sey Dat?[1]
Hylton picked up the nickname "Ghost" as a child in Kingston, Jamaica, from the reaction of other children to his appearance in head bandages after being hit by a bicycle in the road.[2]
In 2020, Ghost released the Christian worship song "Humbly Before Thee" under the Ghetto Youths International label.[2]

Beyond its success as a song, "Slowly" was hugely influential in the history of country music, in that it was among the first (and certainly the most successful to date) songs to feature a pedal steel guitar. The song's iconic intro, played by Bud Isaacs, was said to have sent legions of lap steel guitar players scurrying to their closets for wire coat hangers, with which they attempted to modify their existing instruments to get the pitch shifting effect achieved by Isaacs.
In 2014, The Haden Triplets (Petra, Tanya and Rachel), daughters of jazz double-bassist Charlie Haden, recorded the song for their debut album on Jack White's Third Man Records.[2]

Slowly users can also use a 'Web Version', which runs on a web browser in their PC or laptop. First time Web users can login by using a QR code, generated through the web app and scanned/verified by their mobile device's Slowly app. The Web Client offers easier and faster writing and is generally preferred by users composing longer "letters".[13]
Users are required to create a nickname and an avatar for themselves to get started. They can either manually browse user profiles or be "auto-matched" using an algorithm. It lets users search for people using various filters, such as, common interests or people from particular countries. The app establishes several "House Rules" that must be agreed to before a user can use the app. The "letters" take anything from 30 minutes to 60 hours to "slowly" reach their destination, depending on how far apart the sender and the recipient live.[2] Virtual stamps are collected and attached to the "letters" before mailing them.[11]

Speed at some instant, or assumed constant during a very short period of time, is called instantaneous speed. By looking at a speedometer, one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant.[3] A car travelling at 50 km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50 km. If the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25 km). If it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833 m.
In mathematical terms, the instantaneous speed v{\displaystyle v} is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity v{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}}, that is, the derivative of the position r{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}} with respect to time:[2][4]
According to Jean Piaget, the intuition for the notion of speed in humans precedes that of duration, and is based on the notion of outdistancing.[12] Piaget studied this subject inspired by a question asked to him in 1928 by Albert Einstein: "In what order do children acquire the concepts of time and speed?"[13] Children's early concept of speed is based on "overtaking", taking only temporal and spatial orders into consideration, specifically: "A moving object is judged to be more rapid than another when at a given moment the first object is behind and a moment or so later ahead of the other object."[14]
When proper units are used for tangential speed v, rotational speed ω, and radial distance r, the direct proportion of v to both r and ω becomes the exact equation
Average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed.[3] If the average speed and the time of travel are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to
In the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in a straight line), this can be simplified to v=s/t{\displaystyle v=s/t}.The average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration.
The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to special relativity, is the speed of light in vacuum c = 299792458 metres per second (approximately 1079000000 km/h or 671000000 mph). Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.

Expressed in graphical language, the slope of a tangent line at any point of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope of a chord line of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord. Average speed of an object isVav = s÷t
Tangential speed and rotational speed are related: the greater the RPMs, the larger the speed in metres per second. Tangential speed is directly proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of rotation.[6] However, tangential speed, unlike rotational speed, depends on radial distance (the distance from the axis). For a platform rotating with a fixed rotational speed, the tangential speed in the centre is zero.

Thus, tangential speed will be directly proportional to r when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ω, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand.

where v{\displaystyle v} is speed, d{\displaystyle d} is distance, and t{\displaystyle t} is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50 km/h, slow to 0 km/h, and then reach 30 km/h).
Rotational speed (or angular speed) involves the number of revolutions per unit of time. All parts of a rigid merry-go-round or turntable turn about the axis of rotation in the same amount of time. Thus, all parts share the same rate of rotation, or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time. It is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute (RPM) or in terms of the number of "radians" turned in a unit of time. There are little more than 6 radians in a full rotation (2π radians exactly). When a direction is assigned to rotational speed, it is known as rotational velocity or angular velocity. Rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational speed.

In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed (commonly referred to as v) of an object is the magnitude of the change of its position over time or the magnitude of the change of its position per unit of time; it is thus a scalar quantity.[1] The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval;[2] the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero. Speed is not the same as velocity.

Using this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres.
Speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The SI unit of speed is the metre per second (m/s), but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour (km/h) or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour (mph). For air and marine travel, the knot is commonly used.

where v is tangential speed and ω (Greek letter omega) is rotational speed. One moves faster if the rate of rotation increases (a larger value for ω), and one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs (a larger value for r). Move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move twice as fast. Move out three times as far, and you have three times as much tangential speed. In any kind of rotating system, tangential speed depends on how far you are from the axis of rotation.
Speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving.[5] If a car is said to travel at 60 km/h, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 km/h to the north, its velocity has now been specified.
Linear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time, while tangential speed (or tangential velocity) is the linear speed of something moving along a circular path.[6] A point on the outside edge of a merry-go-round or turntable travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center. Travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed, and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis. This speed along a circular path is known as tangential speed because the direction of motion is tangent to the circumference of the circle. For circular motion, the terms linear speed and tangential speed are used interchangeably, and both use units of m/s, km/h, and others.

Italian physicist Galileo Galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time.[3] In equation form, that is
Mach number (dimensionless), speed divided by the speed of sound;
The big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average velocity is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average speed considers only the total distance travelled.
in natural units (dimensionless), speed divided by the speed of light in vacuum (symbol c = 299792458 m/s).
Different from instantaneous speed, average speed is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h).

"Slow" is a song by Norwegian DJ Matoma featuring American singer Noah Cyrus, released on 11 November 2017 as the lead single from Matoma's second album One in a Million.[1] The track reached the top 30 in Norway and also charted in Sweden and on the US Dance/Electronic Songs chart.

Matoma heard "Make Me (Cry)" by Noah Cyrus and thought Cyrus' voice has "so much soul and personality", so reached out to her. The two worked apart, with Matoma based in Norway.[2] Matoma also said that with "Slow", he wanted to expand beyond his tropical house sound and "do something different from before" but still put out a "banger" before the album and tour.[3] He later said he wanted to make a song that was "future bass-inspired song with lots of bass and big drums in the chorus".[4]
