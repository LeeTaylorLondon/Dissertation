After a long long time, Dehuai was met by a man calling himself "Roger Bacon". Bacon told Dehuai he had heard of the great Earth Sage Dehuai who nearly opened up the gates of hell and wanted to pay him tribute and so "Bacon" gave Dehuai a book called the Pulse Tract. "Bacon" said he had come into possession of it but he was sure the great Dehuai would have more use of it than a simple magican like him. Upon reading the Pulse Tract Dehuai discovered it was a book with the power to invoke the very life force of the planet on mass and was convinced Bacon was just some foolish upstart magician who did not know what he had. When Dehuai asked what Bacon wanted for the document Bacon merely stated he wanted a chance to see the ritual preformed so that he might take notes, slyly Dehuai accepted the gift.
In the sequel game Shadow Hearts: Covenant, Yuri is hunted down by an evil organization called Sapientes Gladio who were old enemies of "Roger Bacon". The lieutenant of Sapientes Gladio assigned with the specific task of neutralizing the powers "Bacon" wielded was named Nicolai Conrad. It had taken so long to find a way to actually stop the divine powers "Bacon" was using that by the time Nicolai actually found an exorcist tool powerful enough to neutralize him "Bacon" was already killed by Yuri, so Nicolai's attention turned instead to Yuri. Since Yuri defeated "Bacon" he, as a Harmonixer, had access to all the demonic power "Bacon" did, ironically Nicolai was deathly afraid of the Hell Lord, Amon, who while powerful was less so than the Seraphic Radiance of whom Nicolai had no knowledge of. Nicolai used the tool he had stolen from the Vatican called the "Holy Mistletoe" to seal away all Yuri's Fusions and shortly after the game's start Yuri finds his Fusion's unavailable to him and must start gathering the Malice from monster souls all over again to bring them out.

If Yuri recovers the Pulse Tract and its two sister books that Bacon was using, the R'lyeh Text and the Émigré Manuscript, and get's a special goblet before freeing the witch Koudelka, he can unleash the full power of the Seraphic Radiance. Yuri will meet the ghost of his father Ben in his heart who reveals that it was he that had put the Seraphic Radiance to sleep in his soul. He agrees to use his powers to merge with the Seraphic Radiance allowing Yuri the chance to conqure it and truly control the Seraphic Radiance's power. Once Yuri beats The Seraphic Radiance his father proudly bids him farewell and leaves Yuri with the limitless powers of the Seraphic Radiance.
In the year 1913, there was a xenophobic Chinese sage named sage Dehuai Li, a patriot of China, or at least deluded himself into believing so. Dehuai wanted to demonstrate his power to the world by expelling the Japanese forces occupying China. Dehuai had attempted a similar ritual 10 years prior, that one was supposed to open a gate to hell, but the rite was stopped thanks to a Japanese special agent named Jinpachiro "Ben" Hyuga, who was a Harmonixer, a being with the power to fuse with monsters he defeated. Ben beat Dehuai to within-an-inch-of-his-life, disfiguring the left side of his body in the process but not in time to stop the ritual as the hell gate opened up, to stop the arch-demon that came through, Hyuga used his powers to merge with it. While fusing with the demon stopped it at first, Ben Hyuga could feel the demon possessing him and asked his friend and Dehuai's brother, Zhuzhen, to kill him before the demon took control. Zhuzhen begrudgingly killed his friend and the demon gate was sealed as was Dehuai's tower. Dehuai went into hiding locking himself away in the depths of his tower for years while he recovered from his wounds.
Yuri's Fusions are all different in form and name than his original Fusions in Shadow Hearts, but in essence they are all the same. There are two endings to get in Shadow Hearts, a good ending and bad, unlocking the Seraphic Radiance is part of the good one but the cannon set forth by Shadow Hearts: Covenant at the game's start shows that the sequel is playing off the bad ending, which is actually more likely for players to get unless they get lucky, are very skilled or look up how to avoid it in favor of the good ending. So in addition to all his other Fusions being sealed The Seraphic Radiance is only further buried. Yuri discovered that the Holy Mistletoe was not only sealing his powers but would slowly destroy his soul even if he died before the curse took full effect. Towards the end of the game if Yuri does several side quests and charges his Malice to its maximum with all his other Fusion's unlocked Yuri will again meet his father's ghost. Jinpachirou "Ben" Hyuga appears to defend Yuri's memories of childhood as they begin shattering from the curse. Jinpachirou expresses his pride at what Yuri has done so far and offers to help him stop the Holy Mistletoe's curse but to do so he needed to unlocked the Seraphic Radiance slumbering far down deep within him. Calling for the Seraphic Radiance meant Jinpachiro could not hold back and would become a conduit of pure destruction for the Seraphic Radiance to unleash its wrath on Yuri. He warned Yuri that if they fought, Yuri might very well die, Yuri accepts though and father and son fight to unleash the power of the "Dark Seraphim" as it is re-dubbed. After a tough fight Yuri wins and his father wishes him the best of luck with his new powers assuring him that whatever happens with the fate of the world he and Yuri's mother, Anne, both loved Yuri very much and were very proud of him. Jinpachiru fades away and Yuri uncovers the Seraphic Radiance for good.

The Seraphic Radiance has a counterpart known as Dark Seraphim which is in Shadow Hearts: Covenant, it has a similar appearance like the Seraphic Radiance and has the exact same attacks. Dark Seraphim is actually the original Japanese name for the Seraphic Radiance.

In order to get the power to catalyze the ritual Dehuai needed someone with a link to the divine, Bacon knew just such a person, Alice Elliot, and proceeded to secure her for Dehuai. Bacon hunted her down until she was fleeing from Europe to China but Bacon was intercepted and stopped by the hero of the game, Yuri Hyuga, son of Ben Hyuga and a Harmonixer like his father. Bacon reported he had lost them to Dehuai and mentioned the interference of the son of the man who had disrupted his first ritual. Dehuai became invested in following the two and said he would do the rest of the work himself since his sacrifice was in China and he had influence throughout the country. After many attempts at hunting them down and many adventures for Yuri and Alice who had teamed up with Zhuzhen and a spy named Margarete, Dehuai managed to capture Alice. Alice's life force was drained and Dehuai began the final rites for invocation. Yuri and his friends broke into Dehuai's tower backed by Lt.Col Kawashima of the Japanese army to revive and free Alice and then defeat Dehaui before he could complete his ritual. When confronted Dehuai confessed he was not attempting his old Demon's Gate Invocation but a new one to invoke the very life force of the planet in what he called his "Reverse Demon's Gate Invocation" designed to summon a being he called the Seraphic Radiance.
The Seraphic Radiance, later redubbed the Dark Seraphim, is a being of unimaginable power and an antagonist in the videogame Shadow Hearts. The Seraphic Radiance is the epitome of the planet's ever building anger for the creatures that slowly kill it, most notably humans. The sage Dehuai attempted to summon the Seraphic Radiance as his personal servant to take control of China from his tower in Shanghai.
Alice, Zhuzhen and Margarete chased sightings of the Seraphic Radiance all across Asia and into Europe. They split up once they reached Europe, Alice and Zhuzhen worked as traveling exorcists chasing any rumors of strange creatures they could find while Maragaete focused on weeding out Bacon who had said he lived in London. Alice and Zhuzhen soon found a vampire lord named Keith Valentine. Keith said there was a crazed young man who could turn into a monster and had crashed into one of his castle's towers and he wanted their help exorcising it, Alice and Zhuzhen knew it had to be Yuri. At the top of Keith's castle the heroes eventually found Yuri who was crazed, while the Seraphic Radiance was no longer dominant the spirits of the monsters Yuri had killed, known as The Four Masks, took advantage of Yuri's fractured mind to possess him and make him fight his friends. Yuri was defeated and subdued and Alice used her powers to go into Yuri's heart and bargain with the Four Masks to save his soul. Yuri was revived and took on the Four Mask's champion, Fox Face, and won. Yuri did not know what happened to the Seraphic Radiance but was just glad to be himself again and reunited with his friends, Bacon on the other hand was very concerned about the presence of the Seraphic Radiance slumbering somewhere inside the harmonixer, considering it to be a major threat to his plans.

Ohsawa reported that Machida gave his team the "impossible" task of making the 3D character models exactly match their 2D concept illustrations.[22] As with the first game, monster designs drew inspiration from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.[16] Incorporating real-time events into the game proved difficult for the staff, although they enjoyed the challenge it provided. Excluding Blanca, who was used for comic relief, real actors were used for all the cast's motion capture. Machida created the storyboards at the beginning of production; initially planning two and a half hours of cutscenes, it eventually extended to over four hours.[21] The game's CGI cutscenes were produced by Avant.[23] A focus for the developers was adjusting the camera angles during real-time scenes.[22]

According to Machida, plans were made for a Shadow Hearts III which would have continued Yuri's story, but these never materialised.[16] A third game in the series, Shadow Hearts: From the New World, was produced by Nautilus.[20] Many team members returned, and the game's production was completed in a very short time.[60][61] Released in Japan in Aruze in 2005, it was published in by Xseed Games in North America the following year, and in Europe by Ghostlight in 2007.[62][63][64] From The New World was the last game produced by Nautilus before their 2007 absorption into Aruze, when they ceased console game development.[65][66][67]

During a mission to Domrémy, Karin's unit is attacked by a demon. To combat him, Karin is partnered with Nicolai to retrieve an artifact called the Holy Mistletoe from Apoina Tower in the Vatican City. Returning to Domrémy, the "demon" turns out to be Yuri, and Nicolai reveals his true goal of destroying Yuri before he can threaten Sapientes Gladio while holding the girl Jeanne hostage. Yuri ends up impaled by the Mistletoe, which begins disrupting his powers and releasing trapped Malice, dark energy generated by monsters. During the attacks on Domrémy, Jeanne is killed, and in Yuri's journey, her spirit resides in the Graveyard. Nicolai blackmails Yuri into retrieving the forbidden Émigré Manuscript in exchange for releasing the captured Roger Bacon. The group is double-crossed and ultimately rescues Bacon. Guided by Bacon, they head to Russia to face Rasputin. Rasputin is fuelling the war through Sapientes Gladio and an alliance with Japanese sympathizers, his ultimate goal being to replace Nicholas II of Russia with Nicolai, the tzar's illegitimate heir. After learning of Rasputin's invulnerability due to his pact with the god Asmodeus, the group flees Russia along with the endangered Anastasia.

In Japan, Foreign Minister Ishimura intends to use Nicolai to destabilize the West and protect Japan from its influence. Attempts to extract Astaroth give the demon full control of Nicolai's body. Yuri's group, allied with his cousin Kurando, fails to prevent Astaroth's escape due to the opposition of Kato and his cloned group of soldiers which includes Ouka. After Astaroth's escape, Kato helps Yuri's group defeat the god at its lair in Mount Fuji. The enraged Nicholai tries to kill Yuri, then attacks Kato when he intercedes; Ouka blocks the blow, dying in Kato's arms. Kato kills Nicolai, later giving Yuri the Émigré Manuscript to attempt Alice's resurrection and declaring them now enemies. The group confronts Ishimura, and when his grandson appears and Ishimura begs they spare him, Yuri flies into a rage and nearly kills Ishimura before breaking down in tears, having forgotten his reason for fighting. Bacon helps Yuri attempt Alice's resurrection. The ritual briefly works, with Alice assuring her love for Yuri before her new body disintegrates. Bacon deduces that Kato encouraged the ritual to use its side effect of time warping for his own ends; Kato plans to travel back in time and rewrite history, unmaking the current world.
Famitsu lauded the game's "unique and detailed" battle system, and expanded breadth compared to the first Shadow Hearts.[43] While Parish found the battle system enjoyable, he noted an archaic structure that was at odds with many other RPGs of the time and a sense of the developers including a little of anything to catch attention, which could potentially hold the game back from mainstream appeal.[41] Fahay found the turn-based mechanics refreshing after recent action-oriented titles like Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, and praised the Judgement Ring mechanics despite it feeling old-fashioned compared to the similar turn-based system of Final Fantasy X.[42] Mason again praised the Judgement Ring and combo system, saying they made up for the slow character progression system.[44] GamePro was generally enthusiastic about the gameplay,[45] and Massimilla lauded the various mechanics for the need for player engagement compared to other similar battle systems.[6] Steinberg called Covenant "a nifty twist on the traditional RPG" due to its unconventional battle mechanics.[11] Dunham again called the system superior to the first game, giving praise to the battles and wider customization options available to players.[2] Marrow once more shared these sentiments, saying that players would be pleasantly lost in the breadth of content available beyond the main story.[4] Gann praised the battle mechanics, and enjoyed the game's level scaling system.[5]

The game's turn-based battles are triggered through both random and scripted encounters.[4] Turn order is dependent on a character's "speed" statistic.[6] Each player character has hit points (health), skill points (magic), and sanity points (SP). SP ordinarily decreases once per turn, and when a character runs out of SP they go berserk and cannot be controlled by the player.[7][4] Actions include a variety of normal attacks, special attacks specific to characters which are earned through side tasks, Crest magic which can be assigned to different characters, Items such as healing and modifiers for character abilities, and defending against attacks.[2][7] After each battle, characters earn experience points to raise their level and character attributes, and Soul energy from defeated monsters. The higher a character's level, the more Crests can be equipped.[8][9]

Covenant takes place in 1915, six months after the events of the first game. At the height of World War I, German Army lieutenant Karin Koenig is drawn into a conflict between original protagonist Yuri Hyuga and the secret society Sapientes Gladio. During gameplay, the player explores various locations through a growing party of characters. Four characters take part in turn-based battles against a variety of enemies, with actions relying on a timing-based system dubbed the Judgement Ring. The game's worldview combines alternate history with elements of Lovecraftian horror.

A Western release in North America and Europe from Midway Games was announced in April 2004 as Shadow Hearts: Covenant.[34] The game was translated into English by ZPang America, and dubbed at the studio of Intersound Post Production.[7][35] The English script was written by returning translator Jeremy Blaustein, returning from Shadow Hearts.[36][37] Looking back on his work, Blaustein picked out Covenant as one of his favorite projects and the one he would wish to be remembered for. He was given "a relatively free hand" when translating, and arranged for voice recording to happen at a good studio in Los Angeles. As a voice director, Blaustine brought on Richard Epcar, who was noted for his work in both anime and gaming. In addition to directing voice acting, he took some roles in Covenant.[36] The game was released in North America on September 27, 2004.[38] It released in Europe the following year on March 11.[39]

The main antagonists are members of Sapientes Gladio, a formerly peaceful secret society perverted into a terrorist group; key characters are its current leader Grigori Rasputin, and his right hand man Nicolai Conrad. Additional characters include Roger Bacon, a 12th century philosopher who achieved imperfect immortality; Kato, a former ally of Yuri's; Jeanne, a young girl from Domrémy; Shadow Hearts antagonist Albert Simon, who appears as a vision in Yuri's mind; Jovis Abraham, the original co-founder of Sapientes Gladio; the Japanese foreign minister Kantaro Ishimura; and Ouka, a cloned version of Kato's dead lover Yoshiko Kawashima.[15][17]

The theme of the game is "happiness", alluding to how people may find happiness in many different ways, reflected mainly in Yuri's story. Due to Yuri's popularity, the character returned for the sequel. The staff initially had the idea of bringing him back alongside Alice as a happily married couple, but ultimately believed that this did not fit the serious tone of the game. As a result, the plot begins with Alice dead, resulting in a negative response from the fans. Machida, impressed with the fans' backlash regarding Yuri not being Karin's lover due to their preference for the relationship between Yuri and Alice, answered that they should play the game.[21] The final plot twist of Karin being Yuri's mother was not decided until Machida was writing the ending. While the more conventional route would be to have Yuri partner with Karin, he felt that went against the "pure love theme" around Yuri and Alice. He also reasoned that Yuri would not have the impetus to change the past if he accepted Karin's love.[16]

A key element of gameplay is the Judgement Ring. Represented as a disc with colored areas on its surface, the player's aim is to hit those areas as a pointer passes over them.[6] If the player fails to hit an area, the attack can either be shortened or canceled altogether. Magic attacks use green hit areas during the initial stages of an attack. For items, blue hit areas are used with increasing hue; the deeper the hue when the player triggers the action, the more effective that item is on its target.[2][7][10] The final portion of each target area is red, and if the player hits it the attack or skill is boosted in power.[6] The Judgement Ring is also used outside battle in shops; when shopping at a merchant, hitting the right areas can discount prices and increase sale values for items.[4][10]

Covenant was developed by Sacnoth, the same studio that had handled both Shadow Hearts and series predecessor Koudelka.[16] During the game's development, Sacnoth was rebranded as Nautilus, with Covenant being the company's first title released under the new branding.[18][19][20] Matsuzo Machida returned as director and writer, and Miyako Kato as character designer. The art director was Takamusa Ohsawa.[16][21][22] Production of the game began in the autumn of 2002. For the sequel of Shadow Hearts the staff wanted to maintain the serious atmosphere from the prequel, while still containing punchlines as comic relief.[21] This was due to feedback from players who felt the storyline and overall tone of Shadow Hearts was too dark and disturbing.[16]

A key ability for both Yuri and late-game playable character Kurando Inugami is Fusion, the ability to transform into a monstrous creature with access to unique abilities.[3] Character attributes are also changed depending on the Fusion type.[12] New fusions for Yuri are unlocked in the Graveyard, a realm within his soul accessed either at save points or on the world map. Charging gravestones with Soul energy gathered from defeated enemies unlocks new Fusions within a specific group.[7][12] Activating a Fusion costs a set amount of SP, with additional SP reduced each turn by an amount dictated by the Fusion form's power.[7]

Shadow Hearts is a role-playing video game (RPG) where players take control of a party led by either Karin Koenig or Yuri Hyuga as they progress through the game; progress is split between a linear story-driven first half and a second-half which allows greater exploration and access to optional areas.[2] During gameplay, the party explores a number of towns and country areas across the Eurasian continent, collecting and buying items and equipment, talking to non-playable characters who act as quests givers and merchants, and completing both story-centered quests and side quests.[3][4][5]

According to Aruze, sales in Japan had reached around 150,000 units by November 2004.[46] A different estimate from an unnamed Nautilus program director said that it sold 120,000 units in Japan by 2005.[18] The game was counted as a success by Aruze and cited as a factor in their gaming division earning a profit during the late 2004 period.[46] Alongside other titles, the game was credited with a rise in sale revenues for Midway Games during the 2004-2005 fiscal year.[47] Sales in North America were similar to that of the Japanese version by 2005 according to Nautilus.[18]

Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu recommended the game to players who enjoyed dark settings and characters.[43] Jeremy Parish, writing for 1UP.com, praised the narrative for its contemporary setting and open association with real-life political and religious organisations.[41] Eurogamer's Rob Fahey criticised the increasing complexity of the plot and need for players to know the original game's story.[42] GamePro focused on the game's comedic elements, which it praised as having translated well from Japanese to English.[45] Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot lauded the blend of serious narrative, mystical elements, and different types of comedy.[6] GameSpy's Steve Steinberg was also positive, warning that those looking for a serious narrative might be turned off by the humour, and also noting some pacing issues.[11] Jeremy Dunham, writing for IGN, praised both the wider narrative and how the characters were written.[2] PALGN's Mark Marrow said that Covenant "produces one of the finest available [stories]" in RPGs.[4] Patrick Gann of RPGFan was positive overall, praising the game's alternate history setting.[5]
The music of Covenant was composed by Yoshitaka Hirota, with additional contributions by Yasunori Mitsuda, Kenji Ito and Tomoko Kobayashi; Kobayashi's contributions were limited to story-related pieces.[25] The three composers were asked to examine and deconstruct the sound of the original Shadow Hearts.[24] Due to the shift in tone, Hirota made the soundtrack more dynamic and emotional without surrendering the signature Shadow Hearts sound.[25] The final soundtrack included over sixty pieces.[24] The previous game's main theme "Icaro" returned in arranged forms.[26] The ending theme "Getsurenka" was written by Hirota and performed by Mio Isayama, with lyrics by Kumiko Hasegawa.[25] A 2CD soundtrack album, Shadow Hearts II Original Soundtrack, was published by Team Entertainment on March 24, 2004.[27]

The combat system of Shadow Hearts was revamped for Covenant, in response to criticism of the first game's mechanics. The Judgement Ring was redesigned, resulting in the addition of multiple ring types and an "auto" mode. The combo system was implemented to make the game feel more rewarding for advanced players.[21] Designer Takehiro Ishida said the reworked battle system would provide a greater sense of speed and action for players, describing its production as a challenge.[24] Machida estimated the gameplay content as being around 40 hours, twice that of the first game.[22] Adjustments and tuning of the mechanics went on until the end of development.[24]

Shadow Hearts is set in an alternate reality, taking place in the year 1915 during World War I, and mingling historical events and people with supernatural elements including divine beings and cosmic horror.[13] The story shifts locations between Europe, Russia, the Near East and Japan.[14] Another key location is the metaphysical Graveyard.[12] The story takes place six months after the events of Shadow Hearts, following on from that game's "bad" ending.[15][16]

After meeting Alice's spirit and having a final talk with Jeanne, Yuri faces Kato as he summons the magical Asuka Stone Platform to enact his plan. Kato is defeated, and tells Yuri that the group must wish for their heart's desire in order to escape. As the others depart to places they can find happiness, the Mistletoe's Curse manifests, and Yuri bids Karin farewell and remains behind. Depending on his answer to a question from Jeanne, Yuri can allow the Curse to consume him and end up in Roger's care as an amnesiac; or commit suicide, reuniting with Alice's spirit before going back in time to the day they met and getting the chance to save her. The latter has been confirmed as the canon ending.[15][16] Whatever Yuri's choice, Karin is sent back in time to Tokyo in 1887, there meeting Yuri's father and deciding to move on with her life; Karin uses the name "Anne", and becomes Yuri's mother.[15]
Lisa Mason of Game Informer referred to the graphics as "jaggy, but really nicely detailed",[44] sentiments echoed by GamePro.[45] Massimilla called the blend of background art, in-game graphics and CGI cutscenes "very easy on the eye".[6] Dunham cited the general presentation as a step up from that of Shadow Hearts despite console-specific graphical faults.[2] Marrow had similar comments to Dunham, saying the game was "extremely fulfilling and very nice on the eyes."[4] Gann generally lauded the game's graphics as a significant improvement over Shadow Hearts, and praise the character designs.[5] The soundtrack met with general praise, although some felt it was inferior to the first game.[2][4][5][6][41][42][45] Reactions to the English voice work were mixed; some praised it, while others felt it lacked polish.[2][4][5][6]
The Judgement Ring is used with every battle action, from standard attacks and special abilities to item use.[11] Some status ailments impact how the Judgement Rings behave.[2] An individual character's Judgement Ring moves at a different speed, and can be customized; options include adjusting hit zone numbers, increasing hit area size, increasing damage while decreasing hit area size, and activating an auto-battle option at the cost of attack power.[4][6][11] Characters, including some enemy types, can use combos with two or more characters. Combos require successful use of the Judgement Ring, in addition to a button trigger to continue and complete the combo. If the button input fails, or a non-compatible ability is used, the combo is broken and all remaining characters lose their turn actions.[7][6] Each successful hit in a combo increases damage for the next character's action. Using four characters in a successful combo triggers a fifth special magical attack.[4]
To overcome Rasputin's power, the group finds Abraham; he reveals that Albert Simons' actions during the events of Shadow Hearts were an attempt to foil Rasputin. Yuri travels inside his soul with Karin's help, meeting Simons' spirit and taming the god Amon. The group returns to Russia, exposing Rasputin. Defeated by Amon, Rasputin sacrifices his soul to Asmodeus, who takes over his body and summons a magical fortress, aiming to obliterate humanity. Prior to leaving, Nicolai confronts Rasputin, revealing that he has made a pact with the god Astaroth. Yuri's group defeats Rasputin, but before dying he reveals that the Mistletoe's Curse will destroy Yuri's memories and that Nicolai intends to release the Malice from Apoina Tower, increasing the War's barbarity. The group is too late to stop Nicolai from releasing Malice into the world as an act of defiance against Yuri. They are about to kill him when Kato intervenes, sealing Apoina Tower and leaving with both Nicolai and the Émigré Manuscript due to Japan's alliance with Russia.

Shichidō garan is a Japanese Buddhist term indicating the seven halls composing the ideal Buddhist temple compound. This compound word is composed of shichidō (七堂), literally meaning "seven halls", and garan (伽藍), meaning "temple". The term is often shortened to just garan. Which seven halls the term refers to varies, and 七堂 may be a misinterpretation of shitsudō (悉堂), meaning "complete temple".[1][2][3] In practice, shichidō garan often simply means a large temple with many buildings.[4]
Hōryū-ji (法隆寺) is a Buddhist temple of the "Shōtoku" sect in Ikaruga, Nara Prefecture, Japan. Its garan is composed of (see plan on the right):
D Butsuden (仏殿)Lit. "Hall of Buddha". A building enshrining the statue of Buddha or of a bodhisattva and dedicated to prayer.[1]

A Chūmon (中門) In a temple, the gate after the naindaimon connected to a kairō[1]
According to a 13th-century text,[10] "a garan is a temple with a kon-dō (main hall), a tō (pagoda), a kō-dō (lecture hall), a shōrō (belfry), a jiki-dō (refectory), a sōbō (monks' living quarters), and a kyōzō (scriptures deposit, library)."[2] These are the seven listed as shichidō elements of a Nanto Rokushū (南都六宗, Nara six sects)[11] temple.[1]
Zuiryū-ji is a Zentemple of the Sōtō sect in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture.
Garan (伽藍)[5] in Japanese is an abbreviated form of the expression sōgya ranma (僧伽藍摩), itself a transliteration of the Sanskrit saMghaaraama (सँघाराम), literally meaning "garden for monks".[6] A Japanese garan was originally just a park where monks gathered together with their teacher, but the term later came to mean "Buddhist temple".
The compound word shichidō garan (七堂伽藍, seven hall temple) is found in a much more recent literature of Edo period,[2][7] referring to a complex that had a complete set of buildings forming an ideal Buddhist temple.
What is counted in the group of seven buildings, or shichidō, can vary greatly from temple to temple, from sect to sect, and from time to time. As mentioned above, shichidō garan could mean a complete temple or even simply a large temple complex.
A 15th-century text[12] describes how Zen school temples (Sōtō (曹洞), Rinzai (臨済))[13] included a butsuden or butsu-dō (main hall), a hattō (lecture hall), a kuin (kitchen/office), a sō-dō (building dedicated to Zazen), a sanmon (main gate), a tōsu (toilet) and a yokushitsu (bath).
Because of the relics they contained, wooden pagodas used to be the centerpiece of the garan, the seven edifices considered indispensable for a temple.[14] They gradually lost importance and were replaced by the kondō (golden hall), because of the magic powers believed to lie within the images the building housed. This loss of status was so complete that the Zen sects, which arrived late in Japan from China, normally do not build any pagoda at all. The layout of four early temples clearly illustrates this trend: they are in chronological order Asuka-dera, Shitennō-ji, Hōryū-ji, and Yakushi-ji.[14] In the first, the pagoda was at the very center of the garan surrounded by three small kondō (see the reconstruction of the temple's original layout). In the second, a single kondō is at the center of the temple and the pagoda lies in front of it. At Hōryū-ji, they are one next to the other. Yakushi-ji has a single, large kondō at the center with two pagodas on the sides. The same evolution can be observed in Buddhist temples in China.

The word garan can be found in a record in Nihon Shoki dated 552, although no monastery of this time survives, so we don't know what they were like.[6]

The gameplay of the Shadow Hearts series follows a similar formula; they are role-playing video games featuring the exploration of multiple locations across the world, and turn-based battle systems triggered through both random and scripted encounters.[6][21][22][23] Other elements include optional content such as minigames and side quests.[21][22] The basic system was established in the first Shadow Hearts, with the next two entries adding new battle elements such as combination attacks and versions of actions that allowed a character to act twice in one turn.[6]

The plots of Shadow Hearts and Covenant are linked by the romance between Yuri Hyuga, a "Harmonixer" capable of capturing and shapeshifting into monsters; and Alice Elliot, an exorcist who holds a key power. During the canon series of events, Alice dies saving Yuri's soul, then Yuri uses an opportunity to return to the beginning of Shadow Hearts and redo events so he can save her.[6][33] Other recurring characters are Koudelka protagonist Koudelka Iasant; Roger Bacon, a 12th-century philosopher who achieved imperfect immortality; and the Valentine family, a clan of friendly vampires.[6][36][37] A recurring plot point across the series is the Émigré Manuscript or Document, a text filled with an ancient civilization's magic for reviving the dead; use of the Émigré Manuscript forms the central mystery of Koudelka and acts as a key plot point in each Shadow Hearts entry.[38][39][40]

Koudelka, released overseas by Infogrames, had its voice acting in English across all regions.[1][61] For Shadow Hearts, the original dialogue was in Japanese and localized into English by Wordbox, with dubbing by TAJ Productions.[61][62][63] Covenant was translated into English by ZPang America, with dubbing handled by Intersound Post Production.[64][65] Both Shadow Hearts and Covenant were released overseas by Midway Games.[66][67] From the New World was released in North America by Xseed Games, acting as one of its first projects alongside Wild Arms 4.[68][69] In Europe, the title was released by Ghostlight.[70] The translation of all three Shadow Hearts titles was handled by Jeremy Blaustein, who had previously worked on the Pokémon anime series, Valkyrie Profile and Metal Gear Solid. During localization, Yuri's first name was changed from "Urmnaf". Blaustein chose "Yuri" as he wanted a name that sounded Russian to reflect the character's origins. He later remembered Covenant as one of his favorite projects.[71][72]

Koudelka was supported by several medial expansions.[5][108] A CD drama based on the game, with Japanese actors and excerpts from its score, was released in November 1999 by Scitron Digital Contents.[109][110] The first of a three-volume manga adaptation, written and illustrated by the game's illustrator Yūji Iwahara, was published in November 1999 by Kadokawa Shoten; the third and final volume was published in September 2000.[111][112][113] The manga would have bridged the narrative gap between Koudelka and its scrapped sequels.[5] A novelization, Koudelka - The Mansion's Scream by Nahoko Korekata, was published by ASCII Media Works in February 2000 as part of its Famitsu Bunko imprint.[108]

The series saw limited media expansions, with Koudelka in particular receiving both a novelization and a manga continuation based on the initial story plan. While Koudelka saw mixed reactions from critics, the Shadow Hearts trilogy saw both contemporary and retrospective praise and is Sacnoth's best-known product. Shadow Hearts: Covenant in particular has been praised as one of the PS2's best RPGs, and was a commercial success for its publishers.

Koudelka combines two distinct styles of gameplay; exploration from fixed camera perspectives and puzzle solving similar to earlier entries in the Resident Evil series; and turn-based combat playing out on a grid triggered through a random encounter system.[28][29][30] The game's original concept called for real-time combat during exploration using surrounding objects as weapons, but internal staff conflict led to a more traditional RPG combat system, separating it from the rest of the gameplay and narrative.[31][32]
Production of Koudelka began with the formation of Sacnoth in 1997 by Hiroki Kikuta and a number of other former Square staff. Internal conflict between Kikuta and the developers eventually led to Kikuta resigning, with planned sequels to Koudelka being cancelled. The setting was instead used by Matsuzo Machida for the original Shadow Hearts. While Machida planned to continue the series after 2005's Shadow Hearts: From the New World, these plans never materialized, with Sacnoth being absorbed into Aruze and ceasing game production in 2007.

In response to feedback from the first game, Machida shifted the tone of Covenant to incorporate more humor, making its central theme the pursuit of happiness.[43] From the New World was produced on a tight time schedule by the same team as Covenant.[19][47][48] The focus was on refining and building upon the gameplay mechanics of Covenant rather than changing anything, with the new setting and characters intended to give series newcomers an easy gateway.[37][19][49] While Machida had plans for a true sequel to Covenant,[33] Nautilus was absorbed into Aruze and rebranded in 2007, ceasing game production operations and eventually being absorbed into Aruze in 2009.[50][51] Also in 2007, Aruze patented with the Judgement Ring battle system.[52] Many of the Shadow Hearts team had by this point moved to feelplus, contributing to the production of several titles including Lost Odyssey.[53] Speaking in 2021, Universal Interactive confirmed that there were no plans to continue the series or remake any of its entries.[54]

A key element of all three entries for both battle and elements outside battle is the Judgement Ring.[6] Represented as a disc with colored areas on its surface, the player's aim is to hit those areas as a pointer passes over them; hit areas are split into different colors, with narrower red areas at the end of each areas increasing the effectiveness of the chosen action.[21][24] Each entry features at least one character who has the power to either absorb or make pacts with supernatural entities and take on their forms and abilities.[21][25][26] Transforming takes sanity points, a resource that when fully depleted causes a character to go berserk and act independently in battle.[6][27]

Koudelka takes place in the late 1890s, a time chosen as a turning point between an era of superstition and the modern technological age.[5] It is set in Nemeton, a fictional converted priory in Aberystwyth, Wales; the setting was inspired by ruins seen on a research trip taken by the developers to Pembrokeshire.[35] Shadow Hearts, which takes place in 1913-1914, spreads its events across the Eurasian continent.[6][10] Covenant takes place six months after the first game in 1915 during World War I.[6] From the New World, while taking place in the same universe as earlier entries, is a spin-off set in the Americas in 1929 during the Prohibition era.[6][19]
The Shadow Hearts universe is set in an alternate history version of Earth; this version of Earth blends real events and figures from history with supernatural events and cosmic horror.[6] Multiple elements of the series' world and enemy design were drawn from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, meant as a deliberate contrast with the enemies of other RPGs at the time. All titles within the series have multiple endings, with a recurring element in Koudelka and Shadow Hearts being that the canon narrative led from their "bad" endings.[33] The original world design drew from several sources, including the writing of Lovecraft, Umberto Eco, William Hope Hodgson and Lord Dunsany.[32] Later narrative design drew from the work of manga creator Go Nagai and screenwriter Keisuke Fujikawa.[33][34]

The Japanese release of Koudelka was "moderately successful" according to a Western report.[86] Shadow Hearts had estimated sales of approximately 110,000 units, sales referred to by Aruze as low.[87] By contrast, Covenant was a commercial success for both Aruze and Midway in its respective release regions.[88][89] Similarly, From the New World was cited as a sales success by its respective Japanese and North American publishers.[69][90]

The Shadow Hearts series began with the production and release of Koudelka.[33] It was developed at Sacnoth, a game developer founded with funding from SNK by former Square composer Hiroki Kikuta; he acted as the game's producer, director, writer and composer. Production began in 1997 following the company's foundation.[32][41] His aim was to create an unconventional horror RPG, though he ended up clashing with the game design staff, and following the release of Koudelka resigned from Sacnoth.[31][41][32] This led to a series of sequels continuing Koudelka's storyline being scrapped.[5]

Chris Breault of Kill Screen, in an article celebrating the first two Shadow Hearts titles, noted its blend of many conventional elements while being "loyal in the end only to the principle of staying weird".[10] Game Informer's Kimberley Wallace wrote a retrospective article on the series, praising the series as a forgotten classic and citing its combination of dark, emotional and comedic content as the reason for its continued niche appeal.[6] In an article about Covenant for RPGFan, Stephanie Sybydlo cited the series as "cool and atmospheric", praising its blending of history and magic together with its combat system; in the same article Robert Fenner negatively noted the shift towards humor that began with Covenant and was fully expressed in From the New World.[91] Anthony John Agnello of GamesRadar praised the series for its "inky, fast-beating heart" that expressed itself best in Covenant.[14] Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek noted that Shadow Hearts was Sacnoth's best-recognised product and stood out during the PS2 era against other RPGs.[92] Cameron Teague of PlayStation Lifestyle cited the series as a candidate of a possible return on the PlayStation 5, citing its atmosphere and themes.[93]

The characters of Koudelka were designed by manga artist Yūji Iwahara, who created over 100 character sketches for the project.[55] For the three Shadow Hearts titles, the characters were designed by Miyako Kato. Series protagonist Yuri was designed to both appear and behave unlike the typical RPG protagonist of the time.[33] During her work on From the New World, several characters went through extensive redesigns.[40] The CGI cutscenes for Koudelka and Shadow Hearts were created by Digital Media Labs.[56][57] Kikuta supervised the motion capture of real-time cutscenes for Koudelka, conducted by Santa Monica-based special-effects company FutureLight.[58] The CGI cutscenes for Covenant and From the New World were created by external company Avant.[59][60] Real-time cutscenes for Covenant were made more realistic, with motion capture being used for most characters.[43]

The music for the Shadow Hearts series was primarily composed by Yoshitaka Hirota, who had earlier worked as a sound designer on Koudelka.[73] Hirota's work on the series music was influenced by his work as a sound designer, incorporating sound effects alongside a wide range of music genres.[73][74] Hirota collaborated with several different composers on each soundtrack.[73] For Shadow Hearts, the collaborators were Masaharu Iwata, Yasunori Mitsuda and Ryo Fukuda.[75] For Covenant, Mitsuda returned along with series newcomers Kenji Ito and Tomoko Kobayashi.[76] With From the New World, Fukuda returned and was joined by Tomoko Imoto and Hirotomi Imoto.[47] The music of Koudelka was composed by Kikuta, who found the experience of writing it to be the easiest aspect of the game's production.[32] All four games received soundtrack albums released between 1999 and 2005,[77][78][79][80] while Hirota released an arrange album in 2005.[81]

Shadow Hearts, which began production following the release of Koudelka, was directed and written by Koudelka art director Matsuzo Machida (originally credited as Matsuzo Itakura).[33][42][43] During this period, Sacnoth's parent company SNK was bought out by Aruze (later Universal Interactive), giving Aruze control of the Shadow Hearts intellectual property.[44][45] Machida wanted to create an RPG with Shadow Hearts that fell outside the typical settings of other RPGs, using the world of Koudelka as a starting point and building upon it with original lore.[33][43] Shadow Hearts was the last game produced by Sacnoth before its rebranding as Nautilus, with its responsibilities split between production of the Shadow Hearts series and supporting work on Aruze's arcade machine business.[46]
