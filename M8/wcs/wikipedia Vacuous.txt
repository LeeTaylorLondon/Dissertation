Vacuous truths most commonly appear in classical logic with two truth values. However, vacuous truths can also appear in, for example, intuitionistic logic, in the same situations as given above. Indeed, if P{\displaystyle P} is false, then P⇒Q{\displaystyle P\Rightarrow Q} will yield a vacuous truth in any logic that uses the material conditional; if P{\displaystyle P} is a necessary falsehood, then it will also yield a vacuous truth under the strict conditional.

Other non-classical logics, such as relevance logic, may attempt to avoid vacuous truths by using alternative conditionals (such as the case of the counterfactual conditional).
In JavaScript, the array method every executes a provided callback function once for each element present in the array, only stopping (if and when) it finds an element where the callback function returns false. Notably, calling the every method on an empty array will return true for any condition.[6]

A statement S{\displaystyle S} is "vacuously true" if it resembles a material conditional statement P⇒Q{\displaystyle P\Rightarrow Q}, where the antecedent P{\displaystyle P} is known to be false.[1][3][2]
"All my children are goats" is a vacuous truth, when spoken by someone without children. Similarly, "None of my children are goats" would also be a vacuous truth, when spoken by someone without children (possibly the same person).

In pure mathematics, vacuously true statements are not generally of interest by themselves, but they frequently arise as the base case of proofs by mathematical induction.[5] This notion has relevance in pure mathematics, as well as in any other field that uses classical logic.
∀x∈A:Q(x){\displaystyle \forall x\in A:Q(x)}, where the set A{\displaystyle A} is empty.This logical form ∀x∈A:Q(x){\displaystyle \forall x\in A:Q(x)} can be converted to the material conditional form in order to easily identify the antecedent. For the above example S{\displaystyle S} "all cell phones in the room are turned off", it can be formally written as ∀x∈A:Q(x){\displaystyle \forall x\in A:Q(x)} where A{\displaystyle A} is the set of all cell phones in the room and Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} is "x{\displaystyle x} is turned off". This can be written to a material conditional statement ∀x∈B:P(x)⇒Q(x){\displaystyle \forall x\in B:P(x)\Rightarrow Q(x)} where B{\displaystyle B} is the set of all things in the room (including cell phones if they exist in the room), the antecedent P(x){\displaystyle P(x)} is "x{\displaystyle x} is a cell phone", and the consequent Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} is "x{\displaystyle x} is turned off".

In Rust, the Iterator::all function accepts an iterator and a predicate and returns true only when the predicate returns true for all items produced by the iterator, or if the iterator produces no items.[8]
These examples, one from mathematics and one from natural language, illustrate the concept of vacuous truths:
Many programming environments have a mechanism for querying if every item in a collection of items satisfies some predicate.It is common for such a query to always evaluate as true for an empty collection.For example:

Vacuously true statements that can be reduced (with suitable transformations) to this basic form (material conditional) include the following universally quantified statements:
"For any integer x, if x > 5 then x > 3."[9] – This statement is true non-vacuously (since some integers are indeed greater than 5), but some of its implications are only vacuously true: for example, when x is the integer 2, the statement implies the vacuous truth that "if 2 > 5 then 2 > 3".
More formally, a relatively well-defined usage refers to a conditional statement (or a universal conditional statement) with a false antecedent.[1][3][2][4] One example of such a statement is "if Tokyo is in France, then the Eiffel Tower is in Bolivia".

Outside of mathematics, statements which can be characterized informally as vacuously true can be misleading. Such statements make reasonable assertions about qualified objects which do not actually exist. For example, a child might truthfully tell their parent "I ate every vegetable on my plate", when there were no vegetables on the child's plate to begin with. In this case, the parent can believe that the child has actually eaten some vegetables, even though that is not true. In addition, a vacuous truth is often used colloquially with absurd statements, either to confidently assert something (e.g. "the dog was red, or I'm a monkey's uncle" to strongly claim that the dog was red), or to express doubt, sarcasm, disbelief, incredulity or indignation (e.g. "yes, and I'm the King of England" to disagree a previously made statement).
"logic - What precisely is a vacuous truth?". Mathematics Stack Exchange.
In mathematics and logic, a vacuous truth is a conditional or universal statement (a universal statement that can be converted to a conditional statement) that is true because the antecedent cannot be satisfied.[1] For example, the statement "she does not own a cell phone" will imply that the statement "all of her cell phones are turned off" will be assigned a truth value. Additionally, the statement "all of her cell phones are turned on" would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: "all of her cell phones are turned on and turned off", which would otherwise be incoherent and false. For that reason, it is sometimes said that a statement is vacuously true because it is meaningless.[2]

Examples common to everyday speech include conditional phrases used as idioms of improbability like "when hell freezes over..." and "when pigs can fly...", indicating that not before the given (impossible) condition is met will the speaker accept some respective (typically false or absurd) proposition.

In Python, the all function returns True if all of the elements of the given iterable are True. The function also returns True when given an iterable of zero length.[7]
This logical form ∀x∈A:Q(x){\displaystyle \forall x\in A:Q(x)} can be converted to the material conditional form in order to easily identify the antecedent. For the above example S{\displaystyle S} "all cell phones in the room are turned off", it can be formally written as ∀x∈A:Q(x){\displaystyle \forall x\in A:Q(x)} where A{\displaystyle A} is the set of all cell phones in the room and Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} is "x{\displaystyle x} is turned off". This can be written to a material conditional statement ∀x∈B:P(x)⇒Q(x){\displaystyle \forall x\in B:P(x)\Rightarrow Q(x)} where B{\displaystyle B} is the set of all things in the room (including cell phones if they exist in the room), the antecedent P(x){\displaystyle P(x)} is "x{\displaystyle x} is a cell phone", and the consequent Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} is "x{\displaystyle x} is turned off".
Such statements are considered vacuous truths, because the fact that the antecedent is false prevents using the statement to infer anything about the truth value of the consequent. In essence, a conditional statement, that is based on the material conditional, is true when the antecedent ("Tokyo is in France" in the example) is false regardless of whether the conclusion or consequent ("the Eiffel Tower is in Bolivia" in the example) is true or false because the material conditional is defined in that way.

An antecedent is the first half of a hypothetical proposition, whenever the if-clause precedes the then-clause. In some contexts the antecedent is called the protasis.[1]

This is a nonlogical formulation of a hypothetical proposition.In this case, the antecedent is P, and the consequent is Q. In an implication, if ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } implies ψ{\displaystyle \psi } then ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is called the antecedent and ψ{\displaystyle \psi } is called the consequent.[2] Antecedent and consequent are connected via logical connective to form a proposition.
Here, "men have walked on the moon" is the antecedent.

States of affairs are complex entities: they are built up from or constituted by other entities.[4][5] Atomic states of affairs are constituted by one particular and one property exemplified by this particular.[6][2] For example, the state of affairs that Socrates is wise is constituted by the particular "Socrates" and the property "wise". Relational states of affairs involve several particulars and a relation connecting them. States of affairs that obtain are also referred to as facts.[2] It is controversial which ontological status should be ascribed to states of affairs that do not obtain.[6] States of affairs have been prominent in 20th-century ontology as various theories were proposed to describe the world as composed of states of affairs.[4][7][8]

A Historical Survey and Conceptual Account of States of Affairs
In a sense of "state of affairs" favored by Ernest Sosa, states of affairs are situational conditions. In fact, in the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,[9] Sosa defines a condition to be a state of affairs, "way things are" or situation—most commonly referred to by a nominalization of a sentence. The expression "Snow's being white", which refers to the condition snow's being white, is a nominalization of the sentence "Snow is white".[9] The truth of the proposition that "snow is white" is a nominalization of the sentence "the proposition that snow is white is true". Snow's being white is a necessary and sufficient condition for the truth of the proposition that snow is white. Conditions in this sense may be called situational.
In philosophy, a state of affairs (German: Sachverhalt),[1] also known as a situation, is a way the actual world must be in order to make some given proposition about the actual world's truth; in other words, a state of affairs is a truth-maker, whereas a proposition is a truth-bearer. Whereas states of affairs either obtain or fail-to-obtain, propositions are either true or false.[2] Some philosophers understand the term "states of affairs" in a more restricted sense as a synonym for "fact". In this sense, there are no states of affairs that do not obtain.[2]

By a statement, I mean "that which one states", not one's stating of it. There are many interpretations of what the term statement means, but generally, it indicates either a meaningful declarative sentence that is either true or false (bivalence). A proposition is an assertion that is made by (i.e., the meaning of) a true or false declarative sentence. A proposition is what a statement means, it is the notion or idea that a statement expresses, i.e., what it represents. It could be said that "2 + 2 = 4" and "two plus two equals four" are two different statements that are expressing the same proposition in two different ways.[1]
In some treatments, "statement" is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content. A statement is regarded as the information content of an information-bearing sentence. Thus, a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to. Statements are abstract logical entities, while sentences are grammatical entities.[2][3]

In either case, a statement is viewed as a truth bearer.
In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement.
Examples of sentences that are not (or do not make) statements:
Philosopher of language Peter Strawson advocated the use of the term "statement" in sense (b) in preference to proposition.Strawson used the term "Statement" to make the point that two declarative sentences can make the same statement if they say the same thing in different ways.Thus, in the usage advocated by Strawson, "All men are mortal." and "Every man is mortal." are two different sentences that make the same statement.
The first two examples are not declarative sentences and therefore are not (or do not make) statements.The third and fourth are declarative sentences but, lacking meaning, are neither true nor false and therefore are not (or do not make) statements.The fifth and sixth examples are meaningful declarative sentences, but are not statements but rather matters of opinion or taste.Whether or not the sentence "Pegasus exists." is a statement is a subject of debate among philosophers.Bertrand Russell held that it is a (false) statement.[citation needed]Strawson held it is not a statement at all.[citation needed]

All varieties of world languages are natural languages, including those that are associated with linguistic prescriptivism or language regulation. (Nonstandard dialects can be viewed as a wild type in comparison with standard languages.) An official language with a regulating academy such as Standard French, overseen by the Académie Française, is classified as a natural language (e.g. in the field of natural language processing), as its prescriptive aspects do not make it constructed enough to be a constructed language or controlled enough to be a controlled natural language.

Some natural languages have become organically "standardized" through the synthesis of two or more pre-existing natural languages over a relatively short period of time through the development of a pidgin, which is not considered a language, into a stable creole language. A creole such as Haitian Creole has its own grammar, vocabulary and literature. It is spoken by over 10 million people worldwide and is one of the two official languages of the Republic of Haiti.

Controlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce ambiguity and complexity. This may be accomplished by decreasing usage of superlative or adverbial forms, or irregular verbs. Typical purposes for developing and implementing a controlled natural language are to aid understanding by non-native speakers or to ease computer processing. An example of a widely-used controlled natural language is Simplified Technical English, which was originally developed for aerospace and avionics industry manuals.
In neuropsychology, linguistics, and philosophy of language, a natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing. They are distinguished from constructed and formal languages such as those used to program computers or to study logic.[1]

Although constructed, International auxiliary languages such as Esperanto and Interlingua are not considered natural languages, with the possible exception of true native speakers of such languages.[3] Natural languages evolve, through fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax, to incrementally improve human communication. In contrast, Esperanto was created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in the late 19th century.

A degenerate conic is a conic section (a second-degree plane curve, defined by a polynomial equation of degree two)that fails to be anirreducible curve.
A convex polyhedron is degenerate if either two adjacent facets are coplanar or two edges are aligned. In the case of a tetrahedron, this is equivalent to saying that all of its vertices lie in the same plane, giving it a volume of zero.
A line segment is a degenerate case of a rectangle which has a side of length 0.

A random variable which can only take one value has a degenerate distribution; if that value is the real number 0, then its probability density is the Dirac delta function.
A degenerate triangle has collinear vertices[3] and zero area, and thus coincides with a segment covered twice (if the three vertices are not all equal; otherwise, the triangle degenerates to a single point). If the three vertices are pairwise distinct, it has two 0° angles and one 180° angle. If two vertices are equal, it has one 0° angle and two undefined angles.
A circle can be thought of as a degenerate ellipse, as the eccentricity approaches 0 and the foci merge.[1]

A set containing a single point is a degenerate continuum.
In quantum mechanics, any such multiplicity in the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator gives rise to degenerate energy levels. Usually any such degeneracy indicates some underlying symmetry in the system.
When the radius of a sphere goes to zero, the resulting degenerate sphere of zero volume is a point.
A hyperbola can degenerate into two lines crossing at a point, through a family of hyperbolae having those lines as common asymptotes.
In mathematics, a degenerate case is a limiting case of a class of objects which appears to be qualitatively different from (and usually simpler than) the rest of the class,[1] and the term degeneracy is the condition of being a degenerate case.[2]
A convex polygon is degenerate if at least two consecutive sides coincide at least partially, or at least one side has zero length, or at least one angle is 180°. Thus a degenerate convex polygon of n sides looks like a polygon with fewer sides. In the case of triangles, this definition coincides with the one that has been given above.
The line is a degenerate case of a parabola if the parabola resides on a tangent plane. In inversive geometry, a line is a degenerate case of a circle, with infinite radius.
A torus degenerates to a circle when its minor radius goes to 0.
A degenerate case thus has special features which makes it non-generic or special cases. However, not all non-generic or special cases are degenerate. For example, right triangles, isosceles triangles and equilateral triangles are non-generic and non-degenerate. In fact, degenerate cases often correspond to singularities, either in the object or in some configuration space. For example, a conic section is degenerate if and only if it has singular points (e.g., point, line, intersecting lines).[4]
A line segment can be viewed as a degenerate case of an ellipse in which the semiminor axis goes to zero, the foci go to the endpoints, and the eccentricity goes to one.
Often, the degenerate cases are the exceptional cases where changes to the usual dimension or the cardinality of the object (or of some part of it) occur. For example, a triangle is an object of dimension two, and a degenerate triangle is contained in a line,[3] which makes its dimension one. This is similar to the case of a circle, whose dimension shrinks from two to zero as it degenerates into a point.[1] As another example, the solution set of a system of equations that depends on parameters generally has a fixed cardinality and dimension, but cardinality and/or dimension may be different for some exceptional values, called degenerate cases. In such a degenerate case, the solution set is said to be degenerate.
For any non-empty subset S⊆{1,2,…,n}{\displaystyle S\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}}, there is a bounded, axis-aligned degenerate rectangle R≜{x∈Rn:xi=ci (for i∈S) and ai≤xi≤bi (for i∉S)}{\displaystyle R\triangleq \left\{\mathbf {x} \in \mathbb {R} ^{n}:x_{i}=c_{i}\ ({\text{for }}i\in S){\text{ and }}a_{i}\leq x_{i}\leq b_{i}\ ({\text{for }}i\notin S)\right\}} where x≜[x1,x2,…,xn]{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \triangleq \left[x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}\right]} and ai, bi, ci are constant (with ai ≤ bi for all i). The number of degenerate sides of R is the number of elements of the subset S. Thus, there may be as few as one degenerate "side" or as many as n (in which case R reduces to a singleton point).

Objects such as the digon and monogon can be viewed as degenerate cases of polygons: valid in a general abstract mathematical sense, but not part of the original Euclidean conception of polygons.
In contexts where self-intersection is allowed, a double-covered sphere is a degenerate standard torus where the axis of revolution passes through the center of the generating circle, rather than outside it.
A root of a polynomial is sometimes said to be degenerate if it is a multiple root, since generically the n roots of an nth degree polynomial are all distinct.[1] This usage carries over to eigenproblems: a degenerate eigenvalue is a multiple root of the characteristic polynomial.
In logic, mathematics and linguistics, And (∧{\displaystyle \wedge }) is the truth-functional operator of logical conjunction; the and of a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true. The logical connective that represents this operator is typically written as ∧{\displaystyle \wedge } or⋅ .[1][2]
Logical conjunction "AND" is also used in SQL operations to form database queries.
falsehood-preserving: yesWhen all inputs are false, the output is false.
English "and" has properties not captured by logical conjunction.For example, "and" sometimes implies order having the sense of "then". For example, "They got married and had a child" in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child.
The word "and" can also imply a partition of a thing into parts, as "The American flag is red, white, and blue."Here, it is not meant that the flag is at once red, white, and blue, but rather that it has a part of each color.

In natural language, the denotation of expressions such as English "and".
And is usually denoted by an infix operator: in mathematics and logic, it is denoted by ∧{\displaystyle \wedge },[2] & or× ; in electronics,⋅ ; and in programming languages, &, &&, or and. In Jan Łukasiewicz's prefix notation for logic, the operator is K, for Polish koniunkcja.[3] Notably, in Microsoft Excel, the AND function is a postfix operator.[4]
In high-level computer programming and digital electronics, logical conjunction is commonly represented by an infix operator, usually as a keyword such as "AND", an algebraic multiplication, or the ampersand symbol & (sometimes doubled as in &&). Many languages also provide short-circuit control structures corresponding to logical conjunction.
^ Smith, Peter. "Types of proof system" (PDF). p. 4.
The operation can also be applied to two binary words viewed as bitstrings of equal length, by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions. For example:
Logical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations, where 0 corresponds to false and 1 to true:
Logical conjunction is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of true if and only if (also known as iff) both of its operands are true.[1][2]
The conjunctive identity is true, which is to say that AND-ing an expression with true will never change the value of the expression. In keeping with the concept of vacuous truth, when conjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary arity, the empty conjunction (AND-ing over an empty set of operands) is often defined as having the result true.
Beyond logic, the term "conjunction" also refers to similar concepts in other fields:

A conjunction A∧B{\displaystyle A\land B} is proven false by establishing either ¬A{\displaystyle \neg A} or ¬B{\displaystyle \neg B}. In terms of the object language, this reads
The membership of an element of an intersection set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical conjunction: x ∈ A ∩ B if and only if (x ∈ A) ∧ (x ∈ B). Through this correspondence, set-theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction, such as associativity, commutativity and idempotence.
In other words, a conjunction can actually be proven false just by knowing about the relation of its conjuncts, and not necessary about their truth values.
In systems where logical conjunction is not a primitive, it may be defined as[5]
truth-preserving: yesWhen all inputs are true, the output is true.
This can be used to select part of a bitstring using a bit mask.For example, 10011101 AND 00001000  =  00001000 extracts the fifth bit of an 8-bit bitstring.
If using binary values for true (1) and false (0), then logical conjunction works exactly like normal arithmetic multiplication.

All the rules from the above property table (except for the last), when taken together, say that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } together with addition and multiplication is a commutative ring with unity. It is the prototype of all objects of such algebraic structure. Only those equalities of expressions are true in Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } for all values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. Certain non-zero integers map to zero in certain rings.
More precisely, each system is embedded in the next, isomorphically mapped to a subset.[5] The commonly-assumed set-theoretic containment may be obtained by constructing the reals, discarding any earlier constructions, and defining the other sets as subsets of the reals.[6] Such a convention is "a matter of choice", yet not.[7]

The natural numbers are not themselves a subset of this set-theoretic representation of the integers. Rather, the set of all integers contains a subset consisting of the positive integers and zero which is isomorphic to the set of natural numbers.

Variable-length representations of integers, such as bignums, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or 10).

Thus it follows that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } together with the above ordering is an ordered ring.
The first five properties listed above for addition say that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }, under addition, is an abelian group. It is also a cyclic group, since every non-zero integer can be written as a finite sum 1 + 1 + ... + 1 or (−1) + (−1) + ... + (−1). In fact, Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } under addition is the only infinite cyclic group—in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }.
The symbol Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is often annotated to denote various sets, with varying usage amongst different authors: Z+{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{+}},Z+{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{+}} or Z>{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{>}} for the positive integers, Z0+{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{0+}} or Z≥{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{\geq }} for non-negative integers, and Z≠{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{\neq }} for non-zero integers. Some authors use Z∗{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{*}} for non-zero integers, while others use it for non-negative integers, or for {–1, 1} (the group of units of Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }). Additionally, Zp{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{p}} is used to denote either the set of integers modulo p (i.e., the set of congruence classes of integers), or the set of p-adic integers.[21][22]

Although ordinary division is not defined on Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }, the division "with remainder" is defined on them. It is called Euclidean division, and possesses the following important property: given two integers a and b with b ≠ 0, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = q × b + r and 0 ≤ r <|b|, where |b| denotes the absolute value of b. The integer q is called the quotient and r is called the remainder of the division of a by b. The Euclidean algorithm for computing greatest common divisors works by a sequence of Euclidean divisions.

The integers are the only nontrivial totally ordered abelian group whose positive elements are well-ordered.[32] This is equivalent to the statement that any Noetherian valuation ring is either a field—or a discrete valuation ring.
The first four properties listed above for multiplication say that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } under multiplication is a commutative monoid. However, not every integer has a multiplicative inverse (as is the case of the number 2), which means that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } under multiplication is not a group.

The integers form the smallest group and the smallest ring containing the natural numbers. In algebraic number theory, the integers are sometimes qualified as rational integers to distinguish them from the more general algebraic integers. In fact, (rational) integers are algebraic integers that are also rational numbers.

In theoretical computer science, other approaches for the construction of integers are used by automated theorem provers and term rewrite engines.Integers are represented as algebraic terms built using a few basic operations (e.g.,zero, succ, pred) and, possibly, using natural numbers, which are assumed to be already constructed (using, say, the Peano approach).

The whole numbers were synonymous with the integers up until the early 1950s.[23][24][25] In the late 1950s, as part of the New Math movement,[26] American elementary school teachers began teaching that "whole numbers" referred to the natural numbers, excluding negative numbers, while "integer" included the negative numbers.[27][28] "Whole number" remains ambiguous to the present day.[29]

In elementary school teaching, integers are often intuitively defined as the union of the (positive) natural numbers, zero, and the negations of the natural numbers. This can be formalized as follows.[33] First construct the set of natural numbers according to the Peano axioms, call this P{\displaystyle P}. Then construct a set P−{\displaystyle P^{-}} which is disjoint from P{\displaystyle P} and in one-to-one correspondence with P{\displaystyle P} via a function ψ{\displaystyle \psi }. For example, take P−{\displaystyle P^{-}} to be the ordered pairs (1,n){\displaystyle (1,n)} with the mapping ψ=n↦(1,n){\displaystyle \psi =n\mapsto (1,n)}. Finally let 0 be some object not in P{\displaystyle P} or P−{\displaystyle P^{-}}, for example the ordered pair (0,0){\displaystyle (0,0)}. Then the integers are defined to be the union P∪P−∪{0}{\displaystyle P\cup P^{-}\cup \{0\}}.

Every equivalence class has a unique member that is of the form (n,0) or (0,n) (or both at once). The natural number n is identified with the class [(n,0)] (i.e., the natural numbers are embedded into the integers by map sending n to [(n,0)]), and the class [(0,n)] is denoted −n (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class [(0,0)] a second time since −0 = 0.

^ More precisely, each system is embedded in the next, isomorphically mapped to a subset.[5] The commonly-assumed set-theoretic containment may be obtained by constructing the reals, discarding any earlier constructions, and defining the other sets as subsets of the reals.[6] Such a convention is "a matter of choice", yet not.[7]
There exist at least ten such constructions of signed integers.[39] These constructions differ in several ways: the number of basic operations used for the construction, the number (usually, between 0 and 2) and the types of arguments accepted by these operations; the presence or absence of natural numbers as arguments of some of these operations, and the fact that these operations are free constructors or not, i.e., that the same integer can be represented using only one or many algebraic terms.
The ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way:
In modern set-theoretic mathematics, a more abstract construction[35][36] allowing one to define arithmetical operations without any case distinction is often used instead.[37] The integers can thus be formally constructed as the equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers (a,b).[38]
Like the natural numbers, Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is closed under the operations of addition and multiplication, that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers (and importantly, 0), Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }, unlike the natural numbers, is also closed under subtraction.[30]

The negation (or additive inverse) of an integer is obtained by reversing the order of the pair:
Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is not closed under division, since the quotient of two integers (e.g., 1 divided by 2) need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under exponentiation, the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).

The technique for the construction of integers presented in the previous section corresponds to the particular case where there is a single basic operation pair(x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} that takes as arguments two natural numbers x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y}, and returns an integer (equal to x−y{\displaystyle x-y}). This operation is not free since the integer 0 can be written pair(0,0), or pair(1,1), or pair(2,2), etc. This technique of construction is used by the proof assistant Isabelle; however, many other tools use alternative construction techniques, notable those based upon free constructors, which are simpler and can be implemented more efficiently in computers.

An integer is often a primitive data type in computer languages. However, integer data types can only represent a subset of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common two's complement representation, the inherent definition of sign distinguishes between "negative" and "non-negative" rather than "negative, positive, and 0". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted int or Integer in several programming languages (such as Algol68, C, Java, Delphi, etc.).
The lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is not closed under division, means that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is not a field. The smallest field containing the integers as a subring is the field of rational numbers. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the field of fractions of any integral domain. And back, starting from an algebraic number field (an extension of rational numbers), its ring of integers can be extracted, which includes Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } as its subring.
This notation recovers the familiar representation of the integers as {..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...} .

An integer is the number zero (0), a positive natural number (1, 2, 3, etc.) or a negative integer with a minus sign (−1, −2, −3, etc.).[1] The negative numbers are the additive inverses of the corresponding positive numbers.[2] In the language of mathematics, the set of integers is often denoted by the boldface Z or blackboard bold Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }.[3][4]

The intuition is that (a,b) stands for the result of subtracting b from a.[38] To confirm our expectation that 1 − 2 and 4 − 5 denote the same number, we define an equivalence relation ~ on these pairs with the following rule:

It is easily verified that these definitions are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes.

The natural numbers are not themselves a subset of this set-theoretic representation of the integers. Rather, the set of all integers contains a subset consisting of the positive integers and zero which is isomorphic to the set of natural numbers.
The above says that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is a Euclidean domain. This implies that Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is a principal ideal domain, and any positive integer can be written as the products of primes in an essentially unique way.[31] This is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

The use of the letter Z to denote the set of integers comes from the German word Zahlen ("numbers")[3][4] and has been attributed to David Hilbert.[16] The earliest known use of the notation in a textbook occurs in Algébre written by the collective Nicolas Bourbaki, dating to 1947.[3][17] The notation was not adopted immediately, for example another textbook used the letter J[18] and a 1960 paper used Z to denote the non-negative integers.[19] But by 1961, Z was generally used by modern algebra texts to denote the positive and negative integers.[20]
The word integer comes from the Latin integer meaning "whole" or (literally) "untouched", from in ("not") plus tangere ("to touch"). "Entire" derives from the same origin via the French word entier, which means both entire and integer.[9] Historically the term was used for a number that was a multiple of 1,[10][11] or to the whole part of a mixed number.[12][13] Only positive integers were considered, making the term synonymous with the natural numbers. The definition of integer expanded over time to include negative numbers as their usefulness was recognized.[14] For example Leonhard Euler in his 1765 Elements of Algebra defined integers to include both positive and negative numbers.[15] However, European mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the middle of the 19th century.[14]
The traditional style of definition leads to many different cases (each arithmetic operation needs to be defined on each combination of types of integer) and makes it tedious to prove that integers obey the various laws of arithmetic.[34]
The set of natural numbers N{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } is a subset of Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }, which in turn is a subset of the set of all rational numbers Q{\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }, itself a subset of the real numbers R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }.[a] Like the natural numbers, Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is countably infinite. An integer may be regarded as a real number that can be written without a fractional component.

Aristotle denies to embrace bivalence for such future contingents;[9] Chrysippus, the Stoic logician, did embrace bivalence for this and all other propositions.The controversy continues to be of central importance in both the philosophy of time and the philosophy of logic.[citation needed]
The third "truth value"u is thus not on par with the other two t and f in our theory. Consideration of its status will show that we are limited to a special kind of truth table".
Assigning Boolean semantics to classical predicate calculus requires that the model be a complete Boolean algebra because the universal quantifier maps to the infimum operation, and the existential quantifier maps to the supremum;[7] this is called a Boolean-valued model. All finite Boolean algebras are complete.
Now if Q(x) is a partial recursive predicate, there is a decision procedure for Q(x) on its range of definition, so the law of the excluded middle or excluded "third" (saying that, Q(x) is either t or f) applies intuitionistically on the range of definition. But there may be no algorithm for deciding, given x, whether Q(x) is defined or not. [...] Hence it is only classically and not intuitionistically that we have a law of the excluded fourth (saying that, for each x, Q(x) is either t, f, or u).

The principle of bivalence is studied in philosophical logic to address the question of which natural-language statements have a well-defined truth value. Sentences that predict events in the future, and sentences that seem open to interpretation, are particularly difficult for philosophers who hold that the principle of bivalence applies to all declarative natural-language statements.[2] Many-valued logics formalize ideas that a realistic characterization of the notion of consequence requires the admissibility of premises that, owing to vagueness, temporal or quantum indeterminacy, or reference-failure, cannot be considered classically bivalent. Reference failures can also be addressed by free logics.[5]

Such puzzles as the Sorites paradox and the related continuum fallacy have raised doubt as to the applicability of classical logic and the principle of bivalence to concepts that may be vague in their application.Fuzzy logic and some other multi-valued logics have been proposed as alternatives that handle vague concepts better. Truth (and falsity) in fuzzy logic, for example, comes in varying degrees. Consider the following statement in the circumstance of sorting apples on a moving belt:

^ "Strong tables" is Kleene's choice of words. Note that even though " u " may appear for the value of Q or R, " t " or " f " may, in those occasions, appear as a value in " Q V R ", " Q & R " and " Q → R ". "Weak tables" on the other hand, are "regular", meaning they have " u " appear in all cases when the value " u " is applied to either Q or R or both. Kleene notes that these tables are not the same as the original values of the tables of Łukasiewicz 1920. (Kleene gives these differences on page 335). He also concludes that " u " can mean any or all of the following: "undefined", "unknown (or value immaterial)", "value disregarded for the moment", i.e. it is a third category that does not (ultimately) exclude " t " and " f " (page 335).

In other words, P and not-P. This violates the law of noncontradiction and, by extension, bivalence. However, this is only a partial rejection of these laws because P is only partially true. If P were 100% true, not-P would be 100% false, and there is no contradiction because P and not-P no longer holds.

We were justified intuitionistically in using the classical 2-valued logic, when we were using the connectives in building primitive and general recursive predicates, since there is a decision procedure for each general recursive predicate; i.e. the law of the excluded middle is proved intuitionistically to apply to general recursive predicates.
The principle of bivalence is related to the law of excluded middle though the latter is a syntactic expression of the language of a logic of the form "P ∨ ¬P". The difference between the principle of bivalence and the law of excluded middle is important because there are logics that validate the law but that do not validate the principle.[2] For example, the three-valued Logic of Paradox (LP) validates the law of excluded middle, but not the law of non-contradiction, ¬(P ∧ ¬P), and its intended semantics is not bivalent.[6]Intuitionistic logic is a two-valued logic but the law of excluded middle does not hold. In classical two-valued logic both the law of excluded middle and the law of non-contradiction hold.[1]
The intended semantics of classical logic is bivalent, but this is not true of every semantics for classical logic. In Boolean-valued semantics (for classical propositional logic), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, "true" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and "false" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than "true" and "false". The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the two-element algebra, which has no intermediate elements.
A famous example[2] is the contingent sea battle case found in Aristotle's work, De Interpretatione, chapter 9:
Morten Heine Sørensen; Paweł Urzyczyn (2006). Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Elsevier. pp. 206–207. ISBN 978-0-444-52077-7.
In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a semantics may or may not possess. It is not the same as the law of excluded middle, however, and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.[2]

Issues such as this have also been addressed in various temporal logics, where one can assert that "Eventually, either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be." (Which is true if "tomorrow" eventually occurs.)

However, the law of the excluded middle is retained, because P and not-P implies P or not-P, since "or" is inclusive. The only two cases where P and not-P is false (when P is 100% true or false) are the same cases considered by two-valued logic, and the same rules apply.

For example, if a determination cannot be made as to whether an apple is red or not-red, then the truth value of the assertion Q: " This apple is red " is " u ". Likewise, the truth value of the assertion R" This apple is not-red " is " u ". Thus the AND of these into the assertion Q AND R, i.e. " This apple is red AND this apple is not-red " will, per the tables, yield " u ". And, the assertion Q OR R, i.e. " This apple is red OR this apple is not-red " will likewise yield " u ".
In order to justify his claim that true and false are the only logical values, Roman Suszko (1977) observes that every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional logic can be provided with a bivalent semantics.[8]

Dealing with Real-World Complexity: Limits, Enhancements and New Approaches for Policy Makers
One of the early motivations for the study of many-valued logics has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician Jan Łukasiewicz proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the as-yet-undetermined. This approach was later developed by Arend Heyting and L. E. J. Brouwer;[2] see Łukasiewicz logic.
Upon observation, the apple is an undetermined color between yellow and red, or it is mottled both colors. Thus the color falls into neither category " red " nor " yellow ", but these are the only categories available to us as we sort the apples. We might say it is "50% red". This could be rephrased: it is 50% true that the apple is red. Therefore, P is 50% true, and 50% false. Now consider:
In logic, the semantic principle (or law) of bivalence states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition (of a theory under inspection) has exactly one truth value, either true or false. [1][2] A logic satisfying this principle is called a two-valued logic[3] or bivalent logic.[2][4]
"Strong tables" is Kleene's choice of words. Note that even though " u " may appear for the value of Q or R, " t " or " f " may, in those occasions, appear as a value in " Q V R ", " Q & R " and " Q → R ". "Weak tables" on the other hand, are "regular", meaning they have " u " appear in all cases when the value " u " is applied to either Q or R or both. Kleene notes that these tables are not the same as the original values of the tables of Łukasiewicz 1920. (Kleene gives these differences on page 335). He also concludes that " u " can mean any or all of the following: "undefined", "unknown (or value immaterial)", "value disregarded for the moment", i.e. it is a third category that does not (ultimately) exclude " t " and " f " (page 335).
Example of a 3-valued logic applied to vague (undetermined) cases: Kleene 1952[11] (§64, pp. 332–340) offers a 3-valued logic for the cases when algorithms involving partial recursive functions may not return values, but rather end up with circumstances "u" = undecided. He lets "t" = "true", "f" = "false", "u" = "undecided" and redesigns all the propositional connectives. He observes that:
