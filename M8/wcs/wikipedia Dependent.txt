Depending on context, a particular noun could be modified by either a restrictive or nonrestrictive adjective clause. For example, while "broccoli" is modified nonrestrictively in the preceding sentence, it is modified restrictively in the following.
"He saw Mary when he was in New York" and "They studied hard because they had a test" both contain adverbial clauses (in italics). Adverbial clauses express when, why, where, opposition, and conditions, and, as with all dependent clauses, they cannot stand alone. For example, When he was in New York is not a complete sentence; it needs to be completed by an independent clause, as in:
Whoever made that assertion is wrong. (They are wrong. The dependent clause serves as the subject of the main clause.)
Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Object of Verb] (Omitted but Implied) +Subject+Verb
The broccoli which (or that) people leave uneaten is often nutritious.
Relative Adverb + Subject + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb)
He went to the Guggenheim Museum when he was in New York.
The vegetables that people often leave uneaten are usually the most nutritious.
I know who said that. (I know them. The dependent clause serves as the object of the main-clause verb "know".)
In English, in some instances the subordinator that can be omitted.
Preposition + Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Object of Preposition] + Subject + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb)
The word "vegetables" is non-specific. Accordingly, for the reader to know which are being mentioned, one must have the information provided in the adjective clause (in italics). Because it restricts the meaning of "vegetable", the adjective clause is called a restrictive clause. It is essential to the meaning of the main clause and uses no commas (and so does not experience a pause when spoken).

Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Object of Preposition] + Subject + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb) + Preposition
In Indo-European languages, a relative clause, also called an adjectival clause or an adjective clause, meets three requirements:
Like all dependent clauses, it contains a verb (and also a subject unless it is a non-finite dependent clause). However, in a pro-drop language the subject may be a zero pronoun: the pronoun may not be explicitly included because its identity is conveyed by a verbal inflection.
This sentence contains two dependent clauses: "When they told me", and "(that) I won the contest", the latter which serves as the object of the verb "told".The connecting word "that", if not explicitly included, is understood to implicitly precede "I won" and in either case functions as a subordinating conjunction. This sentence also includes two independent clauses, "I cried" and "I didn't faint", connected by the coordinating conjunction "but". The first dependent clause, together with its object (the second dependent clause), adverbially modifies the verbs of both main clauses.
A subordinate clause, dependent clause, subclause, or embedded clause is a clause that is embedded within a complex sentence. For instance, in the English sentence "I know that Bette is a dolphin", the clause "that Bette is a dolphin" occurs as the complement of the verb "know" rather than as a freestanding sentence. Subtypes of dependent clauses include content clauses, relative clauses, and adverbial clauses.
However, if the additional information does not help to identify more narrowly the identity of the noun antecedent but rather simply provides further information about it, the adjective clause is nonrestrictive and so requires commas (or a spoken pause) to separate it from the rest of the sentence:
It begins with a relative adverb [when, where, how, or why in English] or a relative pronoun [who, whom, whose, that, what or which in English]. However, the English relative pronoun (other than what) may be omitted and only implied if it plays the role of the object of the verb or object of a preposition in a restrictive clause; for example, He is the boy I saw is equivalent to He is the boy whom I saw, and I saw the boy you are talking about is equivalent to the more formal I saw the boy about whom you are talking.
When they told me (that) I won the contest, I cried, but I didn't faint. (compound-complex sentence)
Owl Online Writing Lab Archive: Identifying Independent and Dependent Clauses
Dependent clauses may be headed by an infinitive, gerund, or other non-finite verb form, which in linguistics is called deranked.For instance:
2Relative (adjectival) clause											Toggle Relative (adjectival) clause subsection																					2.1Punctuation																								2.1.1English punctuation
The adjective clause in English will follow one of these patterns:
The relative clause functions as an adjective, answering questions such as "what kind?", "how many?" or "which one?"
The punctuation of an adjective clause depends on whether it is essential (restrictive) or nonessential (non-restrictive) and uses commas accordingly. Essential clauses are not set off withcommas; nonessential clauses are. An adjective clause is essential if the information it contains is necessary to the meaning of the sentence:
My sister cried because she scraped her knee. (complex sentence)

Possessive Relative Pronoun + Noun [Functioning as Subject] + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb)
A complex sentence contains an independent clause and at least one dependent clause. A sentence with two or more independent clauses plus (one or more) dependent clauses is referred to as a compound-complex sentence. (Every clause contains a subject and predicate.) Here are some English examples:
A content clause, also known as a "noun clause", provides content implied or commented upon by its main clause. It can be a subject, predicate nominative, direct object, appositive, indirect object, or object of the preposition. Some of the English words that introduce content clauses are that, who (and formal whom), whoever (and formal whomever), whether, why, what, how, when, and where. Notice that some of these words also introduce relative and adverbial clauses. A clause is a content clause if a pronoun (he, she, it, or they) could be substituted for it.
The American sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein refined the Marxist aspect of the theory and expanded on it, to form world-systems theory. World Systems Theory is also known as WSTand aligns closely with the idea of the "rich get richer and the poor get poorer". Wallerstein states that the poor and peripheral nations continue to get more poor as the developed core nations use their resources to become richer. Wallerstein developed the World Systems Theory utilizing the Dependence theory along with the ideas of Marx and the Annales School.[16] This theory postulates a third category of countries, the semi-periphery, intermediate between the core and periphery. Wallerstein believed in a tri-modal rather than a bi-modal system because he viewed the world-systems as more complicated than a simplistic classification as either core or periphery nations. To Wallerstein, many nations do not fit into one of these two categories, so he proposed the idea of a semi-periphery as an in between state within his model.[17] In this model, the semi-periphery is industrialized, but with less sophistication of technology than in the core; and it does not control finances. The rise of one group of semi-peripheries tends to be at the cost of another group, but the unequal structure of the world economy based on unequal exchange tends to remain stable.[15] Tausch[15] traces the beginnings of world-systems theory to the writings of the Austro-Hungarian socialist Karl Polanyi after the First World War, but its present form is usually associated with the work of Wallerstein.

"Standard" dependency theory differs from Marxism, in arguing against internationalism and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Theotonio dos Santos described a "new dependency", which focused on both the internal and external relations of less-developed countries of the periphery, derived from a Marxian analysis. Former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso (in office 1995–2002) wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile during the 1960s, arguing that it was an approach to studying the economic disparities between the centre and periphery. Cardoso summarized his version of dependency theory as follows:

Many nations have been affected by both the positive and negative effects of the Dependency Theory. The idea of national dependency on another nation is not a relatively new concept even though the dependency theory itself is rather new. Dependency is perpetuated by using capitalism and finance. The dependent nations come to owe the developed nations so much money and capital that it is not possible to escape the debt, continuing the dependency for the foreseeable future.[22]

The theory was popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a criticism of modernization theory, which was falling increasingly out of favor because of continued widespread poverty in much of the world. At that time the assumptions of liberal theories of development were under attack.[8] It was used to explain the causes of overurbanization, a theory that urbanization rates outpaced industrial growth in several developing countries.[9]

As aid dependence can shift accountability away from the public and to being between state and donors, “presidentialism” can arise. Presidentialism is when the president and the cabinet within a political system have the power in political decision-making. In a democracy, budgets and public investment plans are to be approved by parliament. It is common for donors to fund projects outside of this budget and therefore go without parliament review.[39] This further reinforces presidentialism and establishes practices that undermine democracy. Disputes over taxation and use of revenues are important in a democracy and can lead to better lives for citizens, but this cannot happen if citizens and parliaments don’t know the complete proposed budget and spending priorities.
this produces an unbalanced economic structure both within the peripheral societies and between them and the centers;

[B]oth groups would agree that at the core of the dependency relation between center and periphery lays [lies] the inability of the periphery to develop an autonomous and dynamic process of technological innovation. Technology – the Promethean force unleashed by the Industrial Revolution – is at the center of stage. The Center countries controlled the technology and the systems for generating technology. Foreign capital could not solve the problem, since it only led to limited transmission of technology, but not the process of innovation itself. Baran and others frequently spoke of the international division of labour – skilled workers in the center; unskilled in the periphery – when discussing key features of dependency.[6]

International development aid became widely popularized post World-War Two due to first-world countries trying to create a more open economy as well as cold war competition.[31] In 1970, the United Nations agreed on 0.7% of Gross National Income per country as the target for how much should be dedicated for international aid.[32] In his book “Ending Aid Dependence”, Yash Tondon describes how organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) have driven many African countries into dependency. During the economic crisis in the 1980s and the 1990s, a great deal of Sub-Saharan countries in Africa saw an influx of aid money which in turn resulted in dependency over the next few decades. These countries became so dependent that the President of Tanzania, Benjamin W. Mkapa, stated that “Development aid has taken deep root to the psyche of the people, especially in the poorer countries of the South. It is similar to drug addiction.”

Dependency theorists hold that short-term spurts of growth notwithstanding, long-term growth in the periphery will be imbalanced and unequal, and will tend towards high negative current account balances.[15] Cyclical fluctuations also have a profound effect on cross-national comparisons of economic growth and societal development in the medium and long run. What seemed like spectacular long-run growth may in the end turn out to be just a short run cyclical spurt after a long recession. Cycle time plays an important role. Giovanni Arrighi believed that the logic of accumulation on a world scale shifts over time, and that the 1980s and beyond once more showed a deregulated phase of world capitalism with a logic, characterized - in contrast to earlier regulatory cycles - by the dominance of financial capital.[15]

Some writers have argued for its continuing relevance as a conceptual orientation to the global division of wealth.[3] Dependency theorists can typically be divided into two categories: liberal reformists and neo-Marxists. Liberal reformists typically advocate for targeted policy interventions, while the neo-Marxists believe in a command-centered economy.[4]
Baran placed surplus extraction and capital accumulation at the center of his analysis. Development depends on a population's producing more than it needs for bare subsistence (a surplus). Further, some of that surplus must be used for capital accumulation – the purchase of new means of production – if development is to occur; spending the surplus on things like luxury consumption does not produce development. Baran noted two predominant kinds of economic activity in poor countries. In the older of the two, plantation agriculture, which originated in colonial times, most of the surplus goes to the landowners, who use it to emulate the consumption patterns of wealthy people in the developed world; much of it thus goes to purchase foreign-produced luxury items –automobiles, clothes, etc. – and little is accumulated for investing in development. The more recent kind of economic activity in the periphery is industry—but of a particular kind. It is usually carried out by foreigners, although often in conjunction with local interests. It is often under special tariff protection or other government concessions. The surplus from this production mostly goes to two places: part of it is sent back to the foreign shareholders as profit; the other part is spent on conspicuous consumption in a similar fashion to that of the plantation aristocracy. Again, little is used for development. Baran thought that political revolution was necessary to break this pattern.

Aid dependent countries rank worse in terms of level of corruption than in countries that are not dependent. Foreign aid is a potential source of rents, and rent-seeking can manifest as increased public sector employment. As public firms displace private investment, there is less pressure on the government to remain accountable and transparent as a result of the weakened private sector. Aid assists corruption which then fosters more corruption and creates a cycle. Foreign aid provides corrupt governments with free cash flow which further facilitates the corruption. Corruption works against economic growth and development, holding these poor countries down.[40]

The sine qua non of the dependency relationship is not the difference in technological sophistication, as traditional dependency theorists believe, but rather the difference in financial strength between core and peripheral countries–particularly the inability of peripheral countries to borrow in their own currency. He believes that the hegemonic position of the United States is very strong because of the importance of its financial markets and because it controls the international reserve currency – the US dollar. He believes that the end of the Bretton Woods international financial agreements in the early 1970s considerably strengthened the United States' position because it removed some constraints on their financial actions.

According to economic historian Robert C. Allen, dependency theory's claims are "debatable" due to fact that the protectionism that was implemented in Latin America as a solution ended up failing.[21] The countries incurred too much debt and Latin America went into a recession.[21] One of the problems was that the Latin American countries simply had too small national markets to be able to efficiently produce complex industrialized goods, such as automobiles.[21]

Political dependency occurs when donors have too much influence in the governance of the receiving country. Many donors maintain a strong say in the government due to the country’s reliance on their money, causing a decrease in the effectiveness and democratic-quality of the government.[37] This results in the receiving country’s government making policy that the donor agrees with and supports rather than what the people of the country desire. Government corruptibility increases as a result and inhibits reform of the government and political process in the country.[38] These donors can include other countries or organizations with underlying intentions that may not be in favor of the people. Political dependency is an even stronger negative effect of aid dependency in countries where many of the problems stem from already corrupt politics and a lack of civil rights.[39] For example, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo both have extremely high aid dependency ratios and have experienced political turmoil. The politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have involved civil war and changing of regimes in the 21st century and have one of the highest aid dependency ratios in Africa.

In the 1960s, members of the Latin American Structuralist school argued that there is more latitude in the system than the Marxists believed. They argued that it allows for partial development or "dependent development"–development, but still under the control of outside decision makers. They cited the partly successful attempts at industrialisation in Latin America around that time (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) as evidence for this hypothesis. They were led to the position that dependency is not a relation between commodity exporters and industrialised countries, but between countries with different degrees of industrialisation. In their approach, there is a distinction made between the economic and political spheres: economically, one may be developed or underdeveloped; but even if (somewhat) economically developed, one may be politically autonomous or dependent.[10][page needed] More recently, Guillermo O'Donnell has argued that constraints placed on development by neoliberalism were lifted by the military coups in Latin America that came to promote development in authoritarian guise (O'Donnell, 1982).[11]

Since 2000, aid dependency has decreased by about ⅓.[41] This can be seen in countries like Ghana, whose aid dependency decreased from 47% to 27%, as well as in Mozambique, where the aid dependency decreased from 74% to 58%.[41] Target areas to decrease aid dependence include job creation, regional integration, and commercial engagement and trade.[42] Long-term investment in agriculture and infrastructure are key requirements to end aid dependency as it will allow the country to slowly decrease the amount of food aid received and begin to develop its own agricultural economy and solve the food insecurity

Two other early writers relevant to dependency theory were François Perroux and Kurt Rothschild. Other leading dependency theorists include Herb Addo, Walden Bello, Ruy Mauro Marini, Enzo Faletto, Armando Cordova, Ernest Feder, Pablo González Casanova, Keith Griffin, Kunibert Raffer, Paul Israel Singer, and Osvaldo Sunkel. Many of these authors focused their attention on Latin America; dependency theory in the Islamic world was primarily refined by the Egyptian economist Samir Amin.[15]

Unequal international specialization of the periphery leads to the concentration of activities in export-oriented agriculture and or mining. Some industrialization of the periphery is possible under the condition of low wages, which, together with rising productivity, determine that unequal exchange sets in (double factorial terms of trade < 1.0; see Raffer, 1987)[full citation needed]
Dependency theory is the notion that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. A central contention of dependency theory is that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "world system". This theory was officially developed in the late 1960s following World War II, as scholars searched for the root issue in the lack of development in Latin America.[1]
Dependency theory is considered rather controversial and many say it is not still in effect. Some scholars and politicians claim that with the decline of colonialism, dependency has been erased.[26]Other scholars counter this approach, and state that our society still has national powerhouses such as the United States, European Nations such as Germany and Britain, China, and rising India that hundreds of other nations rely on for military aid, economic investments, etc.[27]

Market economists cite a number of examples in their arguments against dependency theory. The improvement of India's economy after it moved from state-controlled business to open trade is one of the most often cited (see also economy of India, The Commanding Heights). India's example seems to contradict dependency theorists' claims concerning comparative advantage and mobility, as much as its economic growth originated from movements such as outsourcing – one of the most mobile forms of capital transfer. In Africa, states that have emphasized import-substitution development, such as Zimbabwe, have typically been among the worst performers, while the continent's most successful non-oil based economies, such as Egypt, South Africa, and Tunisia, have pursued trade-based development.[20]
Dependency theory originates with two papers published in 1949, one by Hans Singer and one by Raúl Prebisch, in which the authors observe that the terms of trade for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer manufactured goods from the developed countries in exchange for a given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the Prebisch–Singer thesis. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the United Nations Commission for Latin America (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of protectionism in trade if they were to enter a self-sustaining development path. He argued that import-substitution industrialisation (ISI), not a trade-and-export orientation, was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries.[5] The theory was developed from a Marxian perspective by Paul A. Baran in 1957 with the publication of his The Political Economy of Growth.[6] Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of imperialism by Rosa Luxemburg and Vladimir Lenin, and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Some authors identify two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, Celso Furtado, and Aníbal Pinto at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by Paul A. Baran, Paul Sweezy, and Andre Gunder Frank.

A main concern revolving around the issue of foreign aid is that the citizens in the country that is benefiting from aid lose motivation to work after receiving aid. In addition, some citizens will deliberately work less, resulting in a lower income, which in turn qualifies them for aid provision.[34] Aid dependent countries are associated with having a lowly motivated workforce, a result from being accustomed to constant aid, and therefore the country is less likely to make economic progress and the living-standards are less likely to be improved. A country with long-term aid dependency remains unable to be self-sufficient and is less likely to make meaningful GDP growth which would allow for them to rely less on aid from richer countries. Food aid has been criticized heavily along with other aid imports due to its damage to the domestic economy. A higher dependency on aid imports results in a decline in the domestic demand for those products. In the long-run, the agricultural industry in LDC countries grows weaker due to long-term declines in demand as a result from food aid. In the future when aid is decreased, many LDC countries's agricultural markets are under-developed and therefore it is cheaper to import agricultural products.[35] This occurred in Haiti, where 80% of their grain stocks come from the United States even after a large decrease in aid.[36] In countries where there is a primary-product dependency on an item being imported as aid, such as wheat, economic shocks can occur and push the country further into an economic crisis.

It has been proven that foreign aid can prove useful in the long-run when directed towards the appropriate sector and managed accordingly. Specific pairing between organizations and donors with similar goals has produced more success in decreasing dependency than the tradition form of international aid which involves government to government communication. Botswana is a successful example of this. Botswana first began receiving aid in 1966.[38] In this case, Botswana decided which areas needed aid and found donors accordingly rather than simply accepting aid from other countries whose governments had a say in where the money would be distributed towards. Recipient-led cases such as Botswana are more effective partially because it negates the donor’s desirability to report numbers on the efficiency of their programs (that often include short-term figures such as food distributed) and instead focuses more on long-term growth and development that may be directed more towards infrastructure, education, and job development.[39]

Aid dependency also compromises ownership which is marked by the ability of a government to implement its own ideas and policies. In aid dependent countries, the interests and ideas of aid agencies start to become priority and therefore erode ownership.

These structures determine in the long run a rapidly growing tertiary sector with hidden unemployment and the rising importance of rent in the overall social and economic system
this leads to limitations on self-sustained growth in the periphery;
Political corruption has been a strong force associated with maintaining dependency and being unable to see economic growth. During the Obama administration, congress claimed that the anti-corruption criteria The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) used was not strict enough and was one of the obstacles to decreasing aid dependence.[43] Often, in countries with a high corruption perception index the aid money is taken from government officials in the public sector or taken from other corrupt individuals in the private sector. Efforts to disapprove aid to countries where corruption is very prevalent have been a common tool used by organizations and governments to ensure funding is used properly but also to encourage other countries to fix the corruption.

The theory arose as a reaction to modernization theory, an earlier theory of development which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy.[2]

While the widespread belief is that aid is motivated only by assisting poor countries, and this is true in some cases, there is substantial evidence that suggests strategic, political, and welfare interests of the donors are driving forces behind aid. Maizels and Nissanke (MN 1984), and McKinlay and Little (ML, 1977) have conducted studies to analyze donors’ motives. From these studies they found that US aid flows are influenced by military as well as strategic factors. British and French aid is given to countries that were former colonies, and also to countries in which they have significant investment interest and strong trade relations.[33]

An example of the dependency theory is that during the years of 1650 to 1900 European nations such as Britain and France took over or colonialized other nations. They used their superior military technology and naval strength at the time to do this. This began an economic system in the Americas, Africa, and Asia to then export the natural materials from their land to Europe. After shipping the materials to Europe, Britain and the other European countries made products with these materials and then sent them back to colonized parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. This resulted in the transfer of wealth from these regions’ products to Europe for taking control of the products.[23] Armenia's economy depends on its ore exports as the country lacks the technology to produce high-value consumer goods from these ores. Therefore, other countries produce goods with these ores with which Armenia then buys from them.[24] Armenia-Russia trade is an example of the Dependency Theory. The largest export from Armenia is heavy metals which increased during the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Armenia also expanded its exports to Russia in the food sector. Exports of vehicles for land, air, and sea have also increased.[25]

Aid dependency is an economic problem described as the reliance of less developed countries (LDCs) on more developed countries (MDCs) for financial aid and other resources. More specifically, aid dependency refers to the proportion of government spending that is given by foreign donors.[28] Having an aid dependency ratio of about 15%-20% or higher will have negative effects on the country.[29] What causes dependency is the inhibition of development and economic/political reform that results from trying to use aid as a long-term solution to poverty-ridden countries. Aid dependency arose from long term provisions of aid to countries in need in which the receiving country became accustomed to and developed a dependency syndrome.[30] Aid dependency is most common today in Africa. The top donors as of 2013 were the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany while the top receivers were Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Ethiopia.

A dependant (US spelling: dependent) is a person who relies on another as a primary source of income. A common-law spouse who is financially supported by their partner may also be included in this definition.[1] In some jurisdictions, supporting a dependant may enable the provider to claim a tax deduction.

In standard English, sentences are composed of five clause patterns[citation needed]:
A run-on sentence consists of two or more independent clauses (i.e. clauses that have not been made dependent through the use of a relative pronoun or a subordinating conjunction) that are joined without appropriate punctuation: the clauses "run on" into confusion. The independent clauses can be "fused", as in "It is nearly half past five we cannot reach town before dark", in which case the two independent clauses might be separated (between "five" and "we") with a period [...five. We...], a comma and conjunction (...five, and we...), or a semicolon (...five; we...). The independent clauses can be joined inadequately with only a comma (the comma splice).
I will accept your offer or decline it; these are the two options.
The Thought and Its Expression: A Grammar After the System Introduced Into the Best Schools of Germany
Subject + Verb (transitive) + Object + Object ComplementExample: They made him happy.They did not make "him", and they did not make "happy"; they made "him happy"—the object and its complement form a syntactical unit.
A noun clause is a dependent clause that functions like a noun. A noun clause may function as the subject of a clause, a predicate nominative or an object.

This complex sentence contains an adverbial clause, When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house. The adverbial clause describes when and where the action of the main clause, I had only two things on my mind, took place.

In general, run-on sentences occur when two or more independent clauses are joined without using a coordinating conjunction (i.e. for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or correct punctuation (i.e. semicolon, dash, or period).[10][11][12] A run-on sentence can be as short as four words – for instance, I drive she walks, or even I drive, she walks, – because in these short cases there are two subjects paired with two intransitive verbs. An imperative sentence like "Run walk" can be a run-on even if it only has two words.
In grammar, sentence and clause structure, commonly known as sentence composition, is the classification of sentences based on the number and kind of clauses in their syntactic structure. Such division is an element of traditional grammar.
In the English language, a compound sentence is composed of at least two independent clauses. It does not require a dependent clause. The clauses are joined by a coordinating conjunction, a semicolon that functions as a conjunction, a colon instead of a semicolon between two sentences when the second sentence explains or illustrates the first sentence and no coordinating conjunction is being used to connect the sentences, or a conjunctive adverb preceded by a semicolon. A conjunction can be used to make a compound sentence. Conjunctions are words such as for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. Examples:
I don't know how to bake, so I buy my bread already made.
This simple sentence has one independent clause which contains one subject, I, and one verb, run.

If a sentence contains homogenous members referring to another common member of the sentence, the sentence may be considered either simple[3] or compound.[4] If the homogenous members are removed, then the sentence is called contracted. In some languages, like Russian, a comma is not always required in a sentence with homogenous members.[5]
In the first example, the restrictive relative clause who has been deceived specifies or defines the meaning of him in the independent clause, Let him complain. In the second example, the non-restrictive relative clause who have never known your family describes you in the independent clause, You see them standing around you.

In addition to a subject and a verb, dependent clauses contain a subordinating conjunction or similar word. There are a large number of subordinating conjunctions in English. Some of these give the clause an adverbial function, specifying time, place, or manner. Such clauses are called adverbial clauses.
The war was lost; consequently, the whole country was occupied.
The use of a comma to separate two independent clauses without the addition of an appropriate conjunction is called a comma splice and is generally considered an error (when used in the English language).[2] Example:
Some prescriptive grammars[8] consider sentences starting with a conjunction such as but or and to be incomplete sentences, but this style prescription has "no historical or grammatical foundation".[9] Computer grammar checkers often highlight incomplete sentences.
A complex sentence has one or more dependent clauses (also called subordinate clauses). Since a dependent clause cannot stand on its own as a sentence, complex sentences must also have at least one independent clause. In short, a sentence with one or more dependent clauses and at least one independent clause is a complex sentence. A sentence with two or more independent clauses plus one or more dependent clauses is called compound-complex or complex-compound.

Subject + Verb (transitive) + Indirect Object + Direct ObjectExample: She made me a pie.This clause pattern is a derivative of S+V+O, transforming the object of a preposition into an indirect object of the verb, as the example sentence in transformational grammar is actually "She made a pie for me".

A relative clause is a dependent clause that modifies a noun or noun phrase in the independent clause. In other words, the relative clause functions similar to an adjective.
An -ing fragment is a type of incomplete sentence containing a word ending in -ing that is a gerund or noun, not a verb, because it lacks a helping verb. An example is, "Swimming in the ocean".[7]
Sentence 1 is an example of a simple sentence. Sentence 2 is compound because "so" is considered a coordinating conjunction in English, and sentence 3 is complex. Sentence 4 is compound-complex (also known as complex-compound). Example 5 is a sentence fragment.

An incomplete sentence, or sentence fragment, is a set of words that does not form a complete sentence, either because it does not express a complete thought or because it lacks some grammatical element, such as a subject or a verb.[6][7] A dependent clause without an independent clause is an example of an incomplete sentence.
I enjoyed the apple pie that you bought for me.
In this sentence the independent clause contains two noun clauses. The noun clause What she had realized serves as the subject of the verb was, and that love was that moment serves as complement. The sentence also contains a relative clause, when your heart was about to burst.
A simple sentence structure contains one independent clause and no dependent clauses.[2]

The simple sentence in example 1 contains one clause. Example 2 has two clauses (I don't know how to bake and I buy my bread already made), combined into a single sentence with the coordinating conjunction so. In example 3, I enjoyed the apple pie is an independent clause, and that you bought for me is a dependent clause; the sentence is thus complex. In sentence 4, The dog lived in the garden and the cat lived inside the house are both independent clauses; who was smarter is a dependent clause. Example 5 features a noun phrase but no verb. It is not a grammatically complete clause.
A sentence consisting of at least one dependent clause and at least two independent clauses may be called a complex-compound sentence or compound-complex sentence.

The subject is a constituent that can be realized in numerous forms in English and other languages, many of which are listed in the following table:
The prominence of the subject is consistently reflected in its position in the tree as an immediate dependent of the root word, the finite verb.
That nothing else is good enough shouldn't come as a surprise.
The fourth criterion is better applicable to languages other than English given that English largely lacks morphological case marking, the exception being the subject and object forms of pronouns, I/me, he/him, she/her, they/them.
Fergusson, R. and M. Manser 1998. The Macmillan Guide to English Grammar. London: Macmillan.
In languages such as Latin and German the subject of a verb has a form which is known as the nominative case: for example, the form 'he' (not 'him' or 'his') is used in sentences such as he ran, he broke the window, he is a teacher, he was hit by a car. But there are some languages such as Basque or Greenlandic, in which the form of a noun or pronoun when the verb is intransitive (he ran) is different from when the verb is transitive (he broke the window). In these languages, which are known as ergative languages, the concept of subject may not apply at all.
Since subjects are typically marked by the nominative case in German (the fourth criterion above), one can argue that this sentence lacks a subject, for the relevant verb argument appears in the dative case, not in the nominative.
^ For a discussion of the subject status of existential there, see Biber et al. (1999:944).
Existential there-constructions allow for varying interpretations about what should count as the subject, e.g.
Position occupied: The subject typically immediately precedes the finite verb in declarative clauses in English, e.g. Tom laughs.
There are certain constructions that challenge the criteria just introduced for identifying subjects. The following subsections briefly illustrate three such cases in English: 1) existential there-constructions, 2) inverse copular constructions, and 3) locative inversion constructions.
Under the bed have been breeding spiders. - Locative inversion
Omission: Many languages systematically omit a subject that is known in discourse.
In ergative languages such as the nearly extinct Australian language Dyirbal, in a transitive sentence it is the patient rather than the agent that can be omitted in such sentences: Balan dyugumbil baŋgul yaraŋgu balgan, baninyu 'The man (bayi yara) hit the woman (balan dyugumbil) and [she] came here'
From a functional perspective, a subject is a phrase that conflates nominative case with the topic. Many languages (such as those with ergative or Austronesian alignment) do not do this, and by this definition would not have subjects.
See Tesnière (1969:103-105) for the alternative concept of sentence structure that puts the subject and the object on more equal footing since they can both be dependents of a (finite) verb.
^ The division of the clause into a subject and a predicate is a view of sentence structure that is adopted by most English grammars, e.g. Conner (1968:43), Freeborn (1995:121), and Biber et al. (1999:122).
^ For basic discussions of subject-verb agreement, see for instance Barry (1998:68f.), Fergusson and Manser (1998:36f.), and Jurafsky and Martin (2000:366f.).
Chemistry is being studied (by Tom). - The 1st and the 2nd criteria identify Chemistry as the subject.
Semantic role: A typical subject in the active voice is an agent or theme, i.e. it performs the action expressed by the verb or when it is a theme, it receives a property assigned to it by the predicate.
The criteria combine to identify the boys as the subject in sentence 1. But if that is the case, then one might argue that the boys is also the subject in the similar sentence 2, even though two of the criteria (agreement and position occupied) suggest that a chaotic force around here is the subject. When confronted with such data, one has to make a decision that is less than fully arbitrary. If one assumes again that criterion one (agreement) is the most reliable, one can usually identify a subject.

Subjects are indicated using blue, and objects using orange. The special status of the subject is visible insofar as the subject is higher in the tree each time than the object. In theories of syntax that reject the initial division (as is the case in most dependency grammars), the subject is nevertheless also granted a privileged status insofar as it is an immediate dependent of the finite verb. The following trees are those of a dependency grammar:[11]
The subject in a simple English sentence such as John runs, John is a teacher, or John drives a car, is the person or thing about whom the statement is made, in this case John. Traditionally the subject is the word or phrase which controls the verb in the clause, that is to say with which the verb agrees (John is but John and Mary are). If there is no verb, as in Nicola –what an idiot!, or if the verb has a different subject, as in John –I can't stand him!, then 'John' is not considered to be the grammatical subject, but can be described as the topic of the sentence.
Despite her objections, he sold us ten bags of clothes.
In the example sentences below, the subjects are indicated in boldface.
Comrie, Bernard (1981, 2nd ed. 1989) Language Universals and Linguistic Typology. University of Chicago Press.
All of these positions see the subject in English determining person and number agreement on the finite verb, as exemplified by the difference in verb forms between he eats and they eat. The stereotypical subject immediately precedes the finite verb in declarative sentences in English and represents an agent or a theme. The subject is often a multi-word constituent and should be distinguished from parts of speech, which, roughly, classify words within constituents.
^ See Tesnière (1969:103-105) for the alternative concept of sentence structure that puts the subject and the object on more equal footing since they can both be dependents of a (finite) verb.

One criterion for identifying a subject in various languages is the possibility of its omission in coordinated sentences such as the following:[7] The man hit the woman and [the man] came here.
^ See Biber et al. (1999:123) for a similar list of criteria for identifying subjects.
Tom is studying chemistry. - The three criteria agree identifying Tom as the subject.
This suggests that in ergative languages of this kind the patient is actually the subject in a transitive sentence.
Impersonal sentences in Scottish Gaelic can occasionally have a very similar form to the first German example where an actor is omitted. In the following sentence, the word ‘chaidh’ ("went") is an auxiliary carrying tense and is used in an impersonal or passive constructions. The word ‘falbh’ ("leaving") is a verbal noun.
The subject (glossing abbreviations: SUB or SU) is, according to a tradition that can be traced back to Aristotle (and that is associated with phrase structure grammars), one of the two main constituents of a clause, the other constituent being the predicate, whereby the predicate says something about the subject.[2][3] According to a tradition associated with predicate logic and dependency grammars, the subject is the most prominent overt argument of the predicate. By this position all languages with arguments have subjects, though there is no way to define this consistently for all languages.[4] Even in languages such as English, there is not always a perfect match between the semantic predicand and the subject, as a predicate may be predicated on an argument in another clause (see raising).
Another difficult case for identifying the subject is the so-called inverse copular construction, e.g.[9]
Phrase structure trees similar to the ones produced here can be found in numerous introductory texts to grammar and syntax, e.g. Payne (2011).
In a passive construction, the patient becomes the subject by this criterion: The woman was hit by the man and [the woman] came here.
The word gestern 'yesterday' is generally construed as an adverb, which means it cannot be taken as the subject in this sentence. Certain verbs in German also require a dative or accusative object instead of a nominative subject, e.g.
For in depth studies of inverse copular constructions, see Moro (1997) and Mikkelsen (2005).
In the first sentence, all three criteria combine to identify Tom as the subject. In the second sentence, which involves the subject-auxiliary inversion of a yes/no-question, the subject immediately follows the finite verb (instead of immediately preceding it), which means the second criterion is flouted. And in the third sentence expressed in the passive voice, the 1st and the 2nd criterion combine to identify chemistry as the subject, whereas the third criterion suggests that by Tom should be the subject because Tom is an agent.
The fifth criterion is helpful in languages that typically drop pronominal subjects, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Latin, Greek, Japanese, and Mandarin. Though most of these languages are rich in verb forms for determining the person and number of the subject, Japanese and Mandarin have no such forms at all. This dropping pattern does not automatically make a language a pro-drop language. In other languages, like English and French, most clauses should have a subject, which should be either a noun (phrase), a pronoun, or a clause. This is also true when the clause has no element to be represented by it. This is why verbs like rain must have a subject such as it, even if nothing is actually being represented by it. In this case, it is an expletive and a dummy pronoun. In imperative clauses, most languages elide the subject, even in English which typically requires a subject to be present, e.g.
Morphological case: In languages that have case systems, the subject is marked by a specific case, often the nominative.

Yet another type of construction that challenges the subject concept is locative inversion, e.g.
The existence of subject-less clauses can be construed as particularly problematic for theories of sentence structure that build on the binary subject-predicate division. A simple sentence is defined as the combination of a subject and a predicate, but if no subject is present, how can one have a sentence? Subject-less clauses are absent from English for the most part, but they are not unusual in related languages. In German, for instance, impersonal passive clauses can lack a recognizable subject, e.g.

^ For in depth studies of inverse copular constructions, see Moro (1997) and Mikkelsen (2005).
The division of the clause into a subject and a predicate is a view of sentence structure that is adopted by most English grammars, e.g. Conner (1968:43), Freeborn (1995:121), and Biber et al. (1999:122).
While these definitions apply to simple English sentences, defining the subject is more difficult in more complex sentences and in languages other than English. For example, in the sentence It is difficult to learn French, the subject seems to be the word it, and yet arguably[according to whom?] the real subject (the thing that is difficult) is to learn French. A sentence such as It was John who broke the window is more complex still. Sentences beginning with a locative phrase, such as There is a problem, isn't there?, in which the tag question isn't there? seems to imply that the subject is the adverb there, also create difficulties for the definition of subject.[1]
^ Phrase structure trees similar to the ones produced here can be found in numerous introductory texts to grammar and syntax, e.g. Payne (2011).
Tesnière, L. 1969. Éleménts de syntaxe structurale. 2nd edition. Paris: Klincksieck.
Of these three criteria, the first one (agreement) is the most reliable. The subject in English and many other languages agrees with the finite verb in person and number (and sometimes in gender as well). The second and third criterion are merely strong tendencies that can be flouted in certain constructions, e.g.
The subject is a dependent of the root node, the finite verb, in both trees. The object, in contrast, appears lower in the second tree, where it is a dependent of the non-finite verb. The subject remains a dependent finite verb when subject-auxiliary inversion occurs:
Subject-verb agreement: The subject agrees with the finite verb in person and number, e.g. I am vs. *I is.[6]
In sentence 1, the first criterion (agreement) and the second criterion (position occupied) suggest that there is the subject, whereas the third criterion (semantic role) suggests rather that problems is the subject. In sentence 2, in contrast, agreement and semantic role suggest that problems is the subject, whereas position occupied suggests that there is the subject. In such cases then, one can take the first criterion as the most telling; the subject should agree with the finite verb.[8]
For a discussion of the subject status of existential there, see Biber et al. (1999:944).
See Biber et al. (1999:123) for a similar list of criteria for identifying subjects.
The criteria easily identify spiders as the subject in sentence 1. In sentence 2, however, the position occupied suggests that under the bed should be construed as the subject, whereas agreement and semantic role continue to identify spiders as the subject. This is so despite the fact that spiders in sentence 2 appears after the string of verbs in the canonical position of an object. The fact that sentence 3 is bad but sentence 4 is good reveals that something unusual is indeed afoot, since the attempt to question the location fails if the subject does not immediately follow the finite verb. This further observation speaks against taking spiders as the subject in sentence 2. But if spiders is not the subject, then the sentence must lack a subject entirely, which is not supposed to be possible in English.
The subject receives a privileged status in theories of sentence structure. In those approaches that acknowledge the binary division of the clause into a subject and a predicate (as is the case in most phrase structure grammars), the subject is usually an immediate dependent of the root node, whereby its sister is the predicate. The object, in contrast, appears lower in the structure as a dependent of the/a verb, e.g.[10]

Some analyses have derived these distinctions from type compatibility while others explain them in terms of particular properties of the embedding verbs and their complements.

In formal semantics a responsive predicate is an embedding predicate which can take either a declarative or an interrogative complement. For instance, the English verb know is responsive as shown by the following examples.[1][2][3]
Responsives are contrasted with rogatives such as wonder which can only take an interrogative complement and anti-rogatives such as believe which can only take a declarative complement.

Construed in the broad sense, many complements cannot be understood as arguments. The argument concept is tied to the predicate concept in a way that the complement concept is not.

In grammar, a complement is a word, phrase, or clause that is necessary to complete the meaning of a given expression.[1][2] Complements are often also arguments (expressions that help complete the meaning of a predicate).
See Matthews (1981:142f.) and Huddleston (1988:note 2) for good overviews of the different uses of the term complement.
Construed in the broadest sense, any time a given expression is somehow necessary in order to render another expression "complete", it can be characterized as a complement of that expression:[9]

In those examples, the subject and object arguments are taken to be complements. In this area, the terms complement and argument thus overlap in meaning and use. Note that this practice takes a subject complement to be something very different from the subject complements of traditional grammar, which are predicative expressions, as just mentioned above.

In many modern grammars (for instance in those that build on the X-bar framework), the object argument of a verbal predicate is called a complement. In fact, this use of the term is the one that currently dominates in linguistics. A main aspect of this understanding of complements is that the subject is usually not a complement of the predicate:[7]
For examples of theories that take the subject to be a complement of the matrix verb/predicate, see for instance Matthews (1981:101), Pollard and Sag (1994:23), Miller (2011:56).

In many non-theoretical grammars, the terms subject complement (also called a predicative of the subject) and object complement are employed to denote the predicative expressions (predicative complements), such as predicative adjectives and nominals (also called a predicative nominative or predicate nominative), that serve to assign a property to a subject or an object:[3]
While it is less common to do so, one sometimes extends this reasoning to subject arguments:[8]
In linguistics, an adjunct is an optional, or structurally-dispensable, part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that, when it is removed, will not affect the remainder of the sentence except to discard from it some auxiliary information. A more detailed definition of the adjunct emphasizes its attribute as a modifying form, word, or phrase that depends on another form, word, or phrase, being an element of clause structure with adverbial function. An adjunct is not an argument or a predicative expression, and an argument is not an adjunct. The argument-adjunct distinction is central in most theories of syntax and semantics. The terminology used to denote arguments and adjuncts can vary depending on the theory at hand. Some dependency grammars, for instance, employ the term circonstant (instead of adjunct) and follow Tesnière (1959).
However, this use of terminology is avoided by many modern theories of syntax, which typically view the expressions in bold as part of the clause predicate, which means they are not complements of the subject or object but rather are properties that are predicated of the subject or object.
The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language[5] assigns the term "predicative complement" to both uses and shifts the terminological distinction to the verb:
For examples of grammars that employ the terms subject complement and object complement to denote predicative expressions, see Matthews (1981:3ff.), Downing and Locke (1992:64f.), Thomas (1993:46, 49), Brinton (2000:183f.).

Here as before, a conjunction is almost always included, although it does not need to be that:
They also often serve as complements of nouns—both nouns corresponding to the above verbs, and nouns like fact, idea, and so on. Here, that is almost always included:
In grammar, a content clause is a dependent clause that provides content implied or commented upon by an independent clause. The term was coined by Danish linguist Otto Jespersen. They are also known as noun clauses.
In English, there are two main kinds of content clauses: declarative content clauses (or that-clauses), which correspond to declarative sentences, and interrogative content clauses, which correspond to interrogative sentences.
I find it sad that he doesn't know the answer.
The use of the conjunction if to introduce content clauses
Declarative content clauses can have a number of different grammatical roles. They often serve as direct objects of verbs of reporting, cognition, perception, and so on. In this use, the conjunction that may head the clause, but is often omitted:
Interrogative content clauses, often called indirect questions, can be used in many of the same ways as declarative ones; for example, they are often direct objects of verbs of cognition, reporting, and perception, but here they emphasize knowledge or lack of knowledge of one element of a fact:
Like declarative content clauses, they are often postponed to the end of their main clause, with an expletive it standing in their original place, when they serve as the subject of a verb, or as the direct object of a verb that links them to a predicative:
... our hope that someday the whole world will know peace ...
The difference between the terms content clause and complement clause
1English											Toggle English subsection																					1.1Declarative content clauses																											1.2Interrogative content clauses
Such clauses correspond to direct questions, which are questions actually asked. The direct questions corresponding to the examples above are What did you do? How did he manage it? Did I look that bad? Where are the files? Notice how, in English (and in some other languages), different syntax is used in direct and indirect questions: direct questions normally use subject-verb inversion, while indirect questions do not. Reported questions (as in the last of the examples) are also subject to the tense and other changes that apply generally in indirect speech. For more information see interrogative mood and English grammar.
... the idea that a son would do such a thing to his father ...
Finally, they can serve as subjects, as complements of predicative adjectives in clauses with linking verbs or in small clauses or as object complements. In this latter use, they are commonly postponed to the end of their main clause, with an expletive it standing in their original place as subject:

Desideratives (e.g. "I want to write a letter") and manipulatives (e.g. "I made John fight")
A subordinate verb form is said to be deranked if it cannot be used in independent declarative clauses
There are verb forms that possess the same type of person and tense marking as the verb forms used in independent declarative clauses, but differ in mood. Typical examples include such forms as subjunctives and irrealis moods. In the Eskimo–Aleut languages, there are special "dependent moods" used only in subordinate clauses.
Another factor influencing use of deranking is lack of realisation of the dependent event, which often leads in purpose, desiderative and manipulative clauses to the use of moods that cannot be used in independent clauses.
The commonly accepted explanation for the hierarchy outlined in the previous section is that the types of relation at the top of the deranking hierarchy are much more semantically integrated than those at the bottom. Being semantically integrated means that the events in the main and subordinate clauses are linked, which is true of purpose, perception, "before", "when" and "after" clauses, but not of those further rightward in the hierarchy. This integration leads to the use of verb forms not marked for tense, person or aspect, since they are much simpler than verb forms with these markers.
Relations that are temporal and imply that the dependent event takes place within a particular time reference relative to the main event favour verb forms that are unmarked for tense or aspect for the same reason. This is why temporal relations like "before", "when" and "after" come above relationships that have no temporal implication of this type like conditionals.
There are relatively few languages that use deranked verb forms for all subordinate clauses (examples are found amongst the Tungusic and Salishan languages[2]), but most languages with significant verb inflection use deranking for at least some of their subordinate clauses. Exceptions can be found only amongst certain rigidly head-marking languages such as Ainu and Lakhota. Languages with deranking far down (rightward) on the hierarchy are most typically those with extensive nominal case systems. This is because in their presence information expressed by person marking on the verb is already expressed on nouns. If relations of core noun phrases are marked only on the verb, it is less uneconomic to express them in a dependent clause.
There are verb forms that add extra morphemes never found on main clause verbs. Often these are adpositions or case suffixes.
Languages that use deranking for their subordinate-clause verb forms do so according to a definite pattern.
Verb forms that occur in subordinate clauses of various languages that cannot occur in independent clauses are of various types, but there do exist some typical patterns that differentiate these forms from main-clause verb forms in the same language.
The distribution of balancing and deranking in languages that do not belong to one of the two polar types briefly discussed in the previous page[clarification needed] follows a definite hierarchy. If balancing is used at any point, it is used for all points below it on the following list ("to the right" in traditional wording of the deranking hierarchy)[3] Relevant clauses for each example are italicised.
In linguistics, balancing and deranking are terms used to describe the form of verbs used in various types of subordinate clauses and also sometimes in co-ordinate constructions.
Knowledge (e.g. "I know that the weather will be very hot") and propositional attitude (e.g. "I think that we should stay at home today"), plus oblique and indirect object relativisation.
There are verb forms that have the same distinctions of person, tense and aspect as are found in main-clause verbs, but which indicate them using special forms distinct from those of main clause verbs.[1]
From the Augustan period onwards[217] it can also mean "while" or "as long as":
Sometimes postquam is followed by an imperfect indicative tense. In this case the temporal clause describes not an event, but a situation which overlaps in time with the action of the main clause, as in the first example below:[105]
quem ut barbarī incendium effūgisse vīdērunt, tēlīs ēminus missīs, interfēcērunt
The feminine quā is similarly used to refer to a night:
The temporal clause event occurs during the main clause situation:
at hostēs, ubi prīmum nostrōs equitēs cōnspexērunt, quōrum erat V [quīnque] mīlium numerus, cum ipsī nōn amplius DCCC [octingentōs] equitēs habērent...
prius quam in os iniecta glaeba est, locus ille, ubi cremātum est, nihil habet religiōnis
The present participle is the equivalent of cum with the imperfect subjunctive:
'The Evidence of Early Latin on the Subjunctive in Cum-Clauses"
meminī, cum pater in Macedoniā cōnsul esset et essēmus in castrīs, perturbārī exercitum nostrum religiōne et metū
rūrsusque īnstitit quaerere, quotus diēs esset ex quō Nīcomachus ad eum dētulisset indicium.
quibus dē rēbus ... nūper, cum essem in Tūsculānō, disputātum est
cum tempus pōsceret, labōriōsus, patiēns...; īdem, simulac sē remīserat neque causa suberat quārē animī labōrem perferret, luxuriōsus, dissolūtus, libīdinōsus, intemperāns reperiēbātur
The word quandō is often interrogative ("when?") but sometimes, especially in early Latin, it can be a temporal conjunction. It is usually followed by an indicative verb:
vēnistī īrātus omnibus; quod egō, simul ac tē aspexī, prius quam loquī coepistī, sēnsī atque prōvīdī
In the following sentence by Cicero, two different temporal clauses, with ut and cum, follow each other:
Viti (2013), p. 123, citing Kühner and Stegman (1914) p. 340.
postquam īnstrūctī utrimque stābant, cum paucīs procerum in medium ducēs prōcēdunt
Nutting, H. C. (1916). "Where the Latin Grammar Fails". The Classical Weekly, Vol. 9, No. 20 (Mar. 18, 1916), pp. 153–157.
C. The action of the temporal clause is subsequent to that of the main verb:
meminī mē intrāre scholam eius, cum recitātūrus esset in Milōnem
More frequently in this meaning it is followed by the subjunctive. In sentences of this kind there is often an idea of "waiting for something to happen":[11][200]
In the following sentence, the pluperfect subjunctive is used, as if the sentence is reported speech ("I will stay until I have learned"), known as "virtual ōrātiō oblīqua":[227]
The temporal clause describes a situation which began before the main verb and which may overlap with it:
A participle phrase can sometimes follow a preposition of time:[280]
Another, less common, meaning is 'though" or "despite the fact that". The subjunctive is always used:[44]
5.1cum																								5.1.1Historic cum																											5.1.2Imperfect indicative in the main clause																											5.1.3Causal cum																											5.1.4Concessive cum																											5.1.5Adversative cum																											5.1.6Generic cum																											5.1.7"Heard someone saying"																											5.1.8cum with the indicative																											5.1.9Temporal cum with main clause imperfect																											5.1.10fuit tempus cum																											5.1.11cum of time how long																											5.1.12Iterative cum																											5.1.13cum in a future context																											5.1.14Inverted cum clause (cum inversum)																											5.1.15cum prīmum																											5.1.16"I remember when"																											5.1.17cum ... tum
The figures for cum here are for clauses of time only, omitting causal or concessive ones.[8]
The phrase cum prīmum means "as soon as" and it usually takes the indicative mood, just like ut or simulatque.[105] The following example has the perfect indicative:
alter consul, postquam moenibus iam Rōmānīs pulsō hoste perīculum esse dēsierat, et ipse ab Rōmā profectus
As with other conjunctions, a perfect indicative tense after ubi may be iterative. Thus in the following example, ubi vēnī does not mean "when I came" but "whenever I come":
5.4ut																								5.4.1"As soon as, when"																											5.4.2"As, while"																											5.4.3Main verb imperfect																											5.4.4"As" (manner)																											5.4.5utcumque
Sometimes the main clause following a postquam clause is in the imperfect tense. In this case it does not represent a pre-existing situation, but a situation which began or which kept happening after the event in the postquam clause:[127]
In indirect or reported speech, the subjunctive is used in the temporal clause. However, in the following sentence the verb redīrent is understood from the context, and only an ablative absolute remains:
Sometimes several topic words can precede the temporal clause, as in the following:
Nutting, Herbert C. (1920). "Notes on the Cum-Construction". The Classical Journal, Vol. 16, No. 1 (Oct., 1920), pp. 26–33.
cum esset inter bīna castra campus ..., Domitius castrīs Scīpiōnis aciem suam subiēcit
The subjunctive is also used if the clause is part of indirect speech. In the following sentence both verbs are in the historic present tense, the first one subjunctive:
The following has cum with the imperfect indicative, but the perfect indicative in the main clause:
Lūcius Petrosidius aquilifer, cum magnā multitudine hostium premerētur, aquilam intrā vallum prōiēcit
In some sentences the circumstances are given in the main clause, while the main event is in the cum clause, which always comes second. This is known as "cum inversum"[98] or an inverted cum clause:[99] Here cum is followed by a perfect or historic present indicative:
Contrast the same tense used after a postquam or ubi clause, where the imperfect tense describes a subsequent situation (see above).
multa illum disertē dīxisse meminī, cum intrōductus est ex carcere in senātum
ibī eum Caesar cum vīdisset, nihil asperē, nihil acerbē dīxit
Temporal clauses are very frequent in certain styles of Latin such as history, and it is not uncommon to find a sentence introduced by two or three temporal clauses, often mixed with participial phrases of time.
Some verbal nouns, such as adventus "arrival" and reditus "return", can be used in phrases of time:
at ille clāmitare coepit eōdem temporis mōmentō quō audīsset ad Philōtān dēcucurrisse
When the main verb is negative, the perfect indicative is regular:
5.2postquam / posteāquam																								5.2.1With the perfect indicative																											5.2.2Time interval mentioned																											5.2.3Main verb imperfect																											5.2.4postquam with the imperfect																											5.2.5"Since the time when"																											5.2.6"Now that"																											5.2.7Future time
As with other conjunctions which mean "whenever", Livy tends to use the subjunctive in iterative clauses:
iubet Sp. Larcium ad portam Collīnam stāre dōnec hostis praetereat
ubi exceptus benignē ab ignāris cōnsiliī, cum post cēnam in hospitāle cubiculum dēductus esset, amōre ardēns, postquam satis tūta circā sōpītīque omnēs vidēbantur, strictō gladiō, ad dormientem Lūcrētiam vēnit
The phrase fuit tempus cum "there was a time when" can be followed by indicative or subjunctive; but the subjunctive is more common.[53] The following example has the imperfect indicative:
nec dubitō quīn legente tē hās litterās cōnfecta iam rēs futūra sit.
Cicero often writes quotiēnscumque in this meaning. In the following example, the verb is in the perfect tense:
The following examples, where the context is similar, have cum with the subjunctive:
A generalising sentence with priusquam or antequam in present time regularly has the present subjunctive, if affirmative:[253]
The subjunctive is usual if the main verb is an imperative:[253]
In view of the lack of a present participle of the verb sum "I am" in Latin, sometimes an ablative phrase alone, without a verb, can stand for a temporal clause:
The ablative relative pronoun quō "on which" can be used to mean 'the day on which" or 'the time at which", and thus introduce a quasi-temporal clause, as in the following examples from the historian Curtius. The pluperfect subjunctive is used, as the clauses are included in a sentence of indirect speech:
oppidum autem Britannī vocant, cum silvās impedītas vallō atque fossā muniērunt
Nutting, H. C. (1933). "On the History of the Cum-Construction". The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 54, No. 1 (1933), pp. 29–38.
Used with the indicative mood, the conjunction cum can mean "at that time when".[58][59] This is known as 'temporal cum".
In republican Latin, the verb in a dum clause, just as with other temporal clauses, was changed into the subjunctive mood when in indirect speech (imperfect subjunctive in a past context, present subjunctive in a present or future context).
dum longius ab mūnītiōne aberant Gallī, plūs multitūdine tēlōrum prōficiēbant
The following sentence, however, is ambiguous. Some translators interpret it to mean that the situation had already begun when Caesar arrived:
Greenough, J. B. et al. (1903). Allen and Greenough's New Latin Grammar for Schools and Colleges. Boston and London; pp. 350–359.
The other common meaning of ubi is "where". Often a word such as locus "place" or eō 'to that place" in the main clause gives the context for this meaning:
In the following examples, the temporal clause describes an event, while the main clause describes a situation which already existed at the time. The temporal clause verb is perfect or historic present indicative, the main clause verb is imperfect indicative:
Another rare form is dōnique, used four times in Lucretius and four times in Vitruvius but otherwise not found.[11] In this example it is followed by a pluperfect indicative:
Other tenses can be used, such as the future indicative in both halves of the following example:
saepe ex eō audīvī, cum sē scrībere neque consuēsse neque posse dīceret
scrībis in Italiā tē morātūrum dum tibī litterae meae veniant
In the following, both clauses have the imperfect indicative tense:

Steele, R. B. (1910). "Relative Temporal Statements in Latin". The American Journal of Philology, 1910, Vol. 31, No. 3, pp. 265–286.
quae dīvīna rēs dum cōnficiēbātur, quaesīvit ā mē vellemne sēcum in castra proficīscī
eōsque ibī sedēre atque opperīrī prope ad merīdiem, dōnec discipulī nocturnum omne vīnum ēdormiant
Volscī, exiguam spem in armīs aliā undique abscīsā cum temptāssent, praeter cētera adversa locō quoque inīquō ad pugnam congressī, inīquiōre ad fugam, cum ab omnī parte caederentur, ad precēs ā certāmine versī, dēditō imperātōre trāditīsque armīs sub iugum missī, cum singulīs vestīmentīs ignōminiae clādisque plēnī dīmittuntur.
fulgentīs gladiōs hostium vidēbant Deciī, cum in aciem eōrum inruēbant
One difference from English grammar is that in temporal clauses referring to the future (e.g. "when you receive this, write back"), the future or future perfect tense is usually used in Latin where English uses the present. Thus the Latin equivalent is "when you will have received this, write back". In such sentences, if the main verb is an imperative, the future imperative (e.g. scrībitō "write (at that time)") is used. The same tenses are used with conditional sentences starting with sī "if":
Clauses which refer to no definite occasion, but to generalised or repeated actions ("whenever..."), usually use the indicative mood; although from Livy onwards the subjunctive mood could also be used.[86]
The following has perfect in the temporal clause, and the imperfect in the main clause:
B. The action of the temporal clause verb is contemporaneous with the main verb:
Roman authors differ from one another in style, and this is shown among other things by their preference for different conjunctions. The table below[7] shows the number of temporal clauses for some of the most common conjunctions in three historians of the republican period, Julius Caesar, Cornelius Nepos, and Sallust, and two poets of the following generation, Virgil and Ovid. The conjunctions are cum "when, while", postquam "after", ubi "when", ut "as, as soon as, when", simulatque "as soon as". The figures forposteāquam and simulac are included with postquam and simulatque.
The temporal clause describes an event completed before the main verb:
The length of time can also be expressed using an ordinal number:
The main verb following a non-iterative ubi clause in past time is almost always perfect or historic present. Very rarely, however, it can be an imperfect. In this case, as after postquam clauses, it describes a situation which is not pre-existing but which arises subsequent to the temporal clause event:
A common way of classifying temporal clauses is according to whether the action or situation described in the temporal clause is antecedent, contemporaneous, or subsequent to that of the main verb:[5][6]
The tense and mood of the verb used in a temporal clause can affect the meaning. For example, cum vēnisset (pluperfect subjunctive) means "after he came", but cum vēnerat (pluperfect indicative) means "whenever he came". Or again, dum venit (present indicative) means "while he was coming", but dum venīret (imperfect subjunctive) means "until he came".
ubī obstinātam vidēbat et nē mortis quidem metū inclīnārī, addit ad metum dēdecus
eō cum vēnisset, magnā difficultāte adficiēbātur, quā ratiōne ad exercitum pervenīre posset
In authors from the time of Livy onwards, however, the subjunctive is sometimes used in iterative clauses:
It has been argued that the cum inversum kind of temporal clause is an innovation of Latin, not found in other early Indo-European languages.[103] In this type of sentence, there is typically an adverb such as iam "by now", vix "scarcely", or modo "just" in the main clause, and often a word such as repentē or subitō "suddenly" in the cum-clause, as in the above examples.[104]
nam Sēiānus ubi videt mortem Drūsī inultam interfectōribus, ... volūtāre sēcum quōnam modō Germānicī liberōs perverteret
Similarly, the subjunctive is used if the meaning is "before there was a chance for something to happen":
In a past context, if the events are contemporaneous, the imperfect indicative is used in both clauses:

Alternatively, meminī can take an accusative and infinitive accompanied by a circumstantial cum clause with the subjunctive:
Postquam is not used of future time in most classical writers,[141] but is occasionally found in technical writers:[131]
However, if the temporal clause event precedes the main clause event, the perfect indicative tense is used in the temporal clause:[89]
hōc tōtō proeliō, cum ab hōrā septimā ad vesperum pugnātum sit, āversum hostem vidēre nēmō potuit
A participle phrase, or a simple participle, is often used as the equivalent of a temporal clause in Latin. Not every type of temporal clause can be replaced by a participle. The type which can be replaced are the circumstantial clauses with cum,[273] or sometimes a future indefinite cum clause.
The subjunctive became more common, and in authors from the time of Livy onwards it is used often without any particular justification.[245] For example, in the following sentences, the relation is purely temporal:
6Temporal clause equivalents											Toggle Temporal clause equivalents subsection																					6.1Participle phrases																								6.1.1Present participle																											6.1.2Perfect participle																											6.1.3Ablative absolute																											6.1.4After a preposition																														6.2Verbal nouns																											6.3Relative clause																											6.4Coordination
In present or indefinite time, if the two events are simultaneous, the present tense is used in both:
fīēs nōbilium tū quoque fontium mē dīcente cavīs inpositam īlicem saxīs
Quite frequently a topic word precedes the temporal clause conjunction.[19]The topic word sometimes comes from the temporal clause itself, for example eō and id in the following sentences:
Allen and Greenough cite this sentence from Livy, which consists of two temporal clauses, and no fewer than six perfect participles:[293]
In other sentences, however, the cum clause seems more circumstantial:
^ Viti (2013), p. 123, citing Kühner and Stegman (1914) p. 340.
A common meaning is "as soon as", with another event following immediately:
'The idiosyncrasy of the cum inversum and of Latin subordination'
A similar construction is also used in clauses referring to the future, whether or not they are iterative. In future sentences, where English uses a present tense in the temporal clause, the Latin idiom is to use the future tense in both clauses:
Such clauses often imply a spectator ("after he saw that...", "when it became clear that...");[105] they can also be considered "quasi-causal" ("in view of the fact that..."):[131]
However, other tenses are sometimes possible, such as the perfect in the following example:
If the action is continuous, where English would use the perfect continuous tense, Latin uses the present tense in the main clause:
summam dignitātem pavīmentāta porticus habēbat, quod mihī nunc dēnique appāruit, posteāquam et ipsa tōta patet et columnae polītae sunt
A situation in the temporal clause can also be expressed using a pluperfect tense:
tū velim cum prīmum poteris tua cōnsilia ad mē scrībās
The imperfect indicative after dum usually means "as long as X was happening", referring to two situations which happened at an identical time:[192][193]
The future perfect can be used in reference to future time. Here Cicero writes to his friend Atticus:
Just as the relative pronoun quī followed by the subjunctive can have a generic meaning ("the sort of person who..."), so cum can also be generic (i.e. "at such a time as..."). In the following sentence the verb after cum is imperfect subjunctive:[50]
Typically in Latin a temporal clause has a conjunction of time such as cum "when" or postquam "after" at or near the beginning of the clause and a verb at the end. The verb in a Latin temporal clause is usually in the indicative mood, although sometimes, especially when the conjunction is cum, it is in the subjunctive. But if the clause is part of indirect speech, the verb is nearly always in the subjunctive mood.[1]
ferē cotīdiānīs proeliīs cum Germānīs contendunt, cum aut suīs fīnibus eōs prohibent aut ipsī in eōrum fīnibus bellum gerunt
It can also refer to the present, with the present tense:
The conjunction ut "as", "as soon as" has various meanings; when it introduces a temporal clause it is followed by an indicative mood. It is often followed by a perfect indicative such as vīdit "he saw" or vēnit "he came":
^ a b c d e Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 360.
For this practice see: Fowler, W. Warde (1913). "Passing under the Yoke". The Classical Review, Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 48-51.
Literally "he pierced with a spear the side of him (as he was) saying these things".
In the following, situated in future time, it is present subjunctive:
The conjunctions used to introduce temporal clauses sometimes have other, non-temporal, meanings. For example, cum can mean "when", "since", or "although"; dum can mean "while", "until", or "provided that"; ubi can mean "when" or "where", and so on.
Woodcock, E.C. (1959), A New Latin Syntax, (Bristol Classical Press), pp. 172–195.
On the whole, temporal clauses use the indicative mood except, unless they are in indirect speech. The main exceptions are the common use of cum with the imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive, and clauses of the type "before X could happen" or "until such time as X might happen" which anticipate some future event.
As with dum, if there is some idea of waiting for something to happen, the subjunctive is used:[212]
ut vēnī in Arpīnās, cum ad mē frāter vēnisset, in prīmīs nōbīs sermō (isque multus) dē tē fuit.
Sometimes simul alone is used, as in the following example:[127]
The following table[9] shows the relative use of postquam and posteāquam "after" and antequam and priusquam "before":
Allen and Greenough's New Latin Grammar for Schools and Colleges
The word quoad can have a non-temporal meaning ("to the extent that", "as far as"), but it can also be used in a temporal sense, meaning "as long as".[223] When referring to the past it is regularly followed by the perfect indicative tense:
An ut clause with the perfect indicative can be followed by an imperfect indicative. Just as when a cum clause with the perfect indicative is followed by an imperfect, the imperfect describes a pre-existing situation:
credēbam esse facile; tōtum est aliud posteā quam sum ā tē dīiūnctior
With the pluperfect subjunctive, it usually means "after X had happened":
horriferīs accībant vōcibus Orcum, / dōnique eōs vītā prīvārant vermina saeva
ita senēscere oportet virum, quī ... tōtum sē rēī pūblicae quam diū decēbat obtulerit
The table shows that the narrative cum with the subjunctive is very common in Caesar and Nepos, but little used by the other three authors. Sallust used ubi more than any other of the conjunctions, but it was avoided by Nepos. Conversely, Nepos and the two poets make frequent use of ut, but it is never used by Sallust. Caesar made relatively little use of postquam compared with the other authors.
nārrō tibī, plānē relēgātus mihī videor posteā quam in Formiānō sum
In other sentences, the meaning shades into "seeing that" or "since":
From this table it can be seen that Cicero had a clear preference for posteāquam, while the other authors preferred postquam. The conjunction antequam is more common than priusquam in Cicero, and was used to an extent by Livy, but is almost completely avoided by Caesar, Nepos, and Sallust.
Hullihen, Walter (1911a). "A Chapter from an Unpublished Latin Syntax, with Prefatory Discussion". The Classical Weekly, Vol. 4, No. 25 (Apr. 29, 1911), pp. 194–196. (A discussion of antequam / priusquam clauses.)
Kennedy, Benjamin Hall (1871). The Revised Latin Primer. Edited and further revised by Sir James Mountford, Longman 1930; reprinted 1962; pp. 184–186.
The following generalisation shows the present subjunctive after antequam contrasted with the present indicative after cum:
The following example shows the same type of clause situated in past time, and uses the imperfect indicative and pluperfect indicative tenses:
When cum is causal, it always takes the subjunctive even if it refers to present time:[42]
If the main clause comes first, the conjunction is often split up, with prius or ante being placed before the verb in the main clause. This is especially so if the priority is emphasised as in the following example:
Another frequent, non-temporal, meaning of ut with the indicative is "as":
In the following example, fūgit "she fled" is perfect tense, but fugit "she is fleeing", with a short u, is present tense:
The subjunctive may also be used if the main verb is itself subjunctive, expressing a wish:[259]
These long sentences, in which a number of subordinate clauses and participle phrases are followed by a main verb, are known as "periods".[293]
When the verb is a generalising 2nd person singular, the subjunctive is regularly used:[14]
The original meaning is "how long?" or "how long...!", and this meaning is also found.
^ Translated by W. A. McDevitte and W. S. Bohn (1869).
Dum with the present indicative can also be used in a future context. Pliny the Younger pleads with a sick friend to write frequently:
5.6dum																								5.6.1"While"																											5.6.2dum "while" with the subjunctive																											5.6.3"As long as"																											5.6.4"Until"																											5.6.5"Provided that"
In the above examples, the imperfect tense is used in the temporal clause, since it describes to a situation, but the perfect tense is used in the main clause, as is usual in Latin when the length of time a situation lasted is given.[220]
Sometimes, however, the perfect indicative may be used in a generalisation, as in the following:[259][260]
egō, cum ā nostrō Catōne laudābar, reprehendī mē ā cēterīs facile patiēbar
Gildersleeve, B. L. & Gonzalez Lodge (1895). Gildersleeve's Latin Grammar. 3rd Edition. (Macmillan); pp. 359–376.
tū, postquam quī tibī erant amīcī non poterant vincere, ut amīcī tibī essent quī vincēbant effēcistī
A temporal cum clause can be used after meminī "I remember":[53]
eō cum vēnisset, cohortēs quīnque praemissae ā Domitiō ex oppidō pontem flūminis interrumpēbant, quī erat ab oppidō mīlia passuum circiter tria
When referring to the future, just as with cum clauses, the future or future perfect tense is used where English has a present tense:
In the examples below, the events occur at exactly the same time, and the subjunctive could not be used:
The perfect participle is the equivalent of cum with the pluperfect subjunctive:
diēs trīgintā aut plūs eō in nāvī fuī, cum intereā semper mortem exspectābam miser
6.1Participle phrases																								6.1.1Present participle																											6.1.2Perfect participle																											6.1.3Ablative absolute																											6.1.4After a preposition
The future simple is not used in these clauses.[260] However, the future perfect is used if the main verb is negative:[265]
When both verbs are imperfect, the situations overlap in time:
In Nepos comes this sentence with a temporal clause, an ablative absolute, and a main verb:[293]

It is also possible to use an accusative and infinitive to express this meaning:
Milō ... in senātū fuisset eō diē quoad senātus est dīmissus
Translated by W. A. McDevitte and W. S. Bohn (1869).
Another idiom using cum is the following, indicating how long a certain situation has persisted.[53][76] The verb in both clauses is present indicative:
pater omnipotēns adigat mē fulmine ad umbrās / ante, pudor, quam tē violō
dum in ūnam partem oculōs animōsque hostium certāmen āverterat, scālīs capitur mūrus
ducentīs annīs ante quam urbem Rōmam caperent, in Italiam Gallī trānscendērunt
Temporal clauses and participial phrases standing for temporal clauses are especially common in historical writing. Nutting[291] cites the following typical example from Julius Caesar, where a temporal clause with cum is placed between two participle phrases:
plūribus verbīs ad tē scrībam, cum plūs ōtiī nāctus erō
fuit quoddam tempus, cum in agrīs hominēs passim bestiārum modō vagābantur
The indicative is used when the clause is more definite ("I remember that time when..."), while the subjunctive is less definite ("I remember a time when" or "I remember one of the times when...").
Referring to the future, a simple present indicative can be used in the temporal clause in sentences such as the following:[206]
The original meaning of dōnec is "until". In the following example, referring to a future situation, it is followed by a future perfect tense:
Sulla cum Damasippum et alios ... iugulari iussit, quis non factum eius laudabat?
In the examples below ubi means "after" or "since" ("in view of the fact that") rather than "while":
Quandōcumque can also be an adverb meaning "one day (whenever that may be)", as if quandōcumque is short for quandōcumque erit:
In Latin, "I heard him saying" can be expressed as "I heard him while he was saying" (or: "I heard from him while he was saying"), using a cum clause with the subjunctive.[53] This turn of phrase is used several times by Cicero:
^ a b c d Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 372.
cum iam adpropinquāret urbī, omnis sēsē multitūdō ad cognōscendum effūdit
Sometimes the verb is indicative even in an affirmative sentence:
ubī nuntiātum Coriolānō est adesse ingēns mulierum agmen, multō obstinātior erat
An early form of dōnec, but rarely used, was dōnicum (which is found in Cato, Plautus and once in Nepos). In the following example, referring to the future, dōnicum is followed by a future perfect:
Germānī, post tergum clāmōre audītō, cum suōs interficī vidērent, armīs abiectīs .... sē ex castrīs ēiēcērunt.
The longer form ubicumque "wherever" is nearly always used not of time but of place in classical Latin.[160]
From the time of Livy onwards, however, the subjunctive is also used in iterative clauses. In the following example, the tense of dīxisset is pluperfect subjunctive:
cum Caesar in Galliam vēnit, alterīus factiōnis prīncipēs erant Aeduī, alterīus Sēquanī
^ a b c Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 367.
An alternative interpretation is that the cohorts began breaking up the bridge after Caesar arrived. In the following sentence, which has iam and the pluperfect, the situation is definitely already under way:
As well as temporal clauses, Latin has other ways of expressing the time of the main action in a sentence, and which can substitute for a temporal clause.
quō postquam fuga inclīnāvit, aliī arma foedē iactantēs in aquam caecī ruēbant
The usual tense used with postquam is the perfect indicative, when the length of time is given the tense is usually pluperfect:[121]
However, there are also types of sentences where the subjunctive is required even in the republican period, for example where one action is done with the hope of preventing another:
The adverb quotiēns means "how often" or "as often as"; but it can also be used as a conjunction meaning "whenever", as in the following example:
The participle can be in any case, depending on whichever noun it agrees with. In the following sentence, it is in the genitive case:
The main clause situation is interrupted by a temporal clause event
The following example, in a past context, uses the pluperfect tense in the temporal clause:
cum abessem, quotiēnscumque patria in mentem venīret, haec omnia occurrēbant
The verb in the temporal clause usually comes at the end of the clause, although as the examples below show, there are occasional exceptions.
A temporal clause can come before the main clause, after it, or in the middle. It is also possible, in the case of separated prius ... quam, for the main verb to be placed in the middle of the conjunction. In the majority of cases, however, temporal clauses precede the clauses which they modify.[18] This is because the main information which the speaker wishes to communicate, or "focus" of the sentence, tends to be placed second. But if the main information is in the temporal clause (as with cum inversum clauses), they come after the main clause.
The iterative form quandōcumque is used by some authors, but it is rare:
Another possibility commonly used in Latin for expressing time is a participial phrase. For example, the temporal clauses id postquam audīvit (Nepos)[2] "after he heard this" and quod cum audīvisset (Cicero)[3] "when he heard this" both mean much the same thing as the participial phrase quō audītō (Pliny)[4] (literally, "with which heard").
Another meaning with the subjunctive is "as long as" in the sense "provided that" (dummodō may also be used in this meaning):[206]
The conjunctions quoad and dōnec, both meaning "until" or "as long as", also show variation. Quoad occurs 144 times in Cicero but only twice in Tacitus.[10] It is rare in poetry, occurring once in Horace and twice in Lucretius only. Conversely, dōnec is hardly found at all in writers of the republican period, but became popular under the empire; in Tacitus it occurs 140 times.[11][12][13]

Schlicher, J. J. (1909). 'the Temporal Cum-Clause and Its Rivals". Classical Philology Vol. 4, No. 3 (Jul., 1909), pp. 256–275.
hīc paulīsper est pugnātum, cum irrumpere nostrī cōnārentur, illī castra dēfenderent
The conjunction postquam or posteā quam can also mean "since".[131] In this case the temporal clause describes how long the situation has been going on. When the main verb is negative, the perfect tense is used in the main clause:
5.5simul atque / simul ac																								5.5.1Past context																											5.5.2Future context																											5.5.3Iterative
ubī lūx adventābat, ... dē imprōvīsō ... mīlitēs clāmõrem tollere atque portīs erumpere iubet
Meminī can also be followed by an accusative and infinitive construction, combined with a temporal cum clause:
When dum means "while this was happening", explaining the background circumstances of the action in the main clause, it tends to be followed by the present indicative, even in a past context:[175][176]
The word utcumque usually means "in whatever way", but there are a few places where it is used in a temporal sense to mean "whenever", as in this hymn to the Muses:
ad extrēmum vērō, cum iste iam dēcēdēbat, ... litterās ad eōs mīsit
In the above example, the perfect indicative tense fuit "it was" implies that the period of Sparta's greatness is now over.[193]
The conjunction dum can also mean "until". In the following, it is used with the present indicative:
Hannibal iam subībat mūrōs, cum repentē in eum ērumpunt Rōmānī
When the sentence mentions a time interval, the use of the indicative more likely:[245]
Sometimes post and quam are separated, and the time is put into the accusative case:
However, in Tacitus, there are some exceptions, when the present indicative is retained.[189]

multum cum in omnibus rēbus tum in rē mīlitārī potest fortūna
Greene, John (1907). "Emphasis in Latin Prose". The School Review, Nov., 1907, Vol. 15, No. 9, pp. 643–654.
It can also mean "as" or "while", when followed by the imperfect indicative:[131]
Sometimes, however, it takes a subjunctive verb, like the ordinary historic cum. The verb inciperet below is imperfect subjunctive:
The use of the subjunctive with the concessive meaning of cum is found even in very early Latin:[46]
Another very common temporal conjunction is postquam (less commonly posteāquam or posteā quam, mainly in Cicero) "after". The most common use is when one event followed another, in which case postquam is usually followed by the perfect indicative:[105]
"A Chapter from an Unpublished Latin Syntax, with Prefatory Discussion (Concluded)"
The conjunction simul atque or simul ac, also written as one word, is used in the same way as postquam or ubi. When the sentence refers to a single occasion in the past, the tense in the temporal clause is perfect indicative, as in the following examples:[105]
Another conjunction meaning "while" or "as long as" is quamdiū or quam diū. When referring to the past, it is frequently followed by a perfect indicative:
A second way of classifying temporal clauses is whether the sentence refers to a definite time, as in the above examples, or is iterative, describing a generalisation or repeated action at an indefinite time:
The tense and mood used in a temporal clause may also vary with the conjunction: postquam audīvit ("after he heard") uses the perfect indicative, but cum audīvisset ("when he had heard") uses the pluperfect subjunctive, although the meaning is very similar or identical. In a past context, the conjunctions postquam, ubi, ut, and simulatque tend to use the perfect or imperfect indicative, whereas cum is usually followed by the imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive.
^ For this practice see: Fowler, W. Warde (1913). "Passing under the Yoke". The Classical Review, Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 48-51.
When cum has the subjunctive mood, it usually expresses a fact of secondary importance. In such clauses 'the mind of the writer seems always fixed on something farther on, which is of more importance to him".[26] This is known as "circumstantial cum".
A. The action of the temporal clause verb is antecedent to that of the main verb:
A subjunctive verb after ubi may indicate indirect speech, as in the following example, where the subjunctive datum sit indicates that the words "when the signal is given" are part of the order, that is, they indicate when the shout was to be raised, not when the order was given:
id āctum est praetōre mē, quīnquenniō ante quam cōnsul factus sum
haec dum aguntur, intereā Cleomenēs iam ad Pelōrī lītus pervenerat
Frequently, the meaning "when" shades into "since" and gives the cause of the action of the main verb. In some sentences, either interpretation (causal or temporal) is possible, while in others "seeing that" or "since" or "in view of the fact that" is better:
Referring to the past, the perfect indicative may be used:
In other sentences the topic word comes from the main clause, such as Balbum in the example below:
Other conjunctions which have similar meanings to dum are dōnec and quōad. Dōnec is never used by Caesar, and almost never by Cicero, but it is very common in later writers such as Livy, Pliny the Elder, and Tacitus.[209]
nōn faciam fīnem rogandī quoad nōbīs nūntiātum erit tē id fēcisse
A temporal clause is an adverbial clause of time, that is to say, a clause which informs the reader about the time when the action of main verb of the sentence occurred. So in a sentence such as "after I had said this, he went out", the first clause is a temporal clause. The name comes from the Latin word tempus, genitive temporis, 'time".
The main verb can also be a historic infinitive, representing a situation:
In a past context, a pluperfect or imperfect indicative indicates an iterative situation:[141]
In some authors also, such as Livy and later writers, as well as poets such as Virgil, dum can take the same construction as circumstantial cum, even when not in indirect speech, using the imperfect subjunctive:[190]
In the early Latin of Plautus, both types of cum were followed by the indicative mood; however, in the classical period, whenever the meaning is causal or concessive, cum is always followed by the subjunctive mood. When the meaning is purely of time, in a present or future context, the indicative is usual; in a past context, in the classical period, both subjunctive and indicative are used, but the subjunctive is much more common.[25]
minor est ista quam ego fuī, cum prīmum virum passa sum?
When referring to the past, a temporal clause with priusquam or antequam usually has the subjunctive, especially from the time of the emperor Augustus onwards. However, some sentences use the perfect indicative, especially those which are negative, such as the following:[240]
iamque hoc facere noctū apparābant, cum mātrēs familiae repentē in pūblicum prōcurrērunt
In such sentences the cum clause can also have the perfect tense, as in the following example:
Another category of cum clause argued for by some grammarians is known as "adversative", in which two situations are contrasted:[48]
Lewis, C. T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin Dictionary.
As with postquam, the imperfect indicative may occasionally be used after ubi, although this is not very common:
The main clause event occurs during the temporal clause situation:
^ Spevak, Olga (2010). Constituent Order in Classical Latin Prose, p. 14.
Another meaning, also with the indicative, is "at that time when first":
apud Graecōs quidem iam annī prope quadringentī sunt cum hoc probātur
A fourth method of classification, followed in this article, is according to the different conjunctions used.
Livy also writes sentences containing a mixture of participial and temporal clauses. The following sentence has four participles or participial phrases, a cum clause, and a postquam clause, followed by the main verb:
Over the three centuries between 200 BC and 100 AD, the use of the subjunctive in temporal clauses became more common. The conjunction cum mostly has the indicative in Plautus, but in Caesar the majority of cum clauses have the subjunctive. Iterative clauses (that is, those meaning "whenever...") usually have the indicative in Caesar and Cicero, but from Livy onwards the subjunctive became usual.[14] A similar increased use of the subjunctive can be seen in clauses containing dum "while / until" and priusquam "before".[15]
ratiōnēs ad aerārium, antequam Dolābella condemnātus est, non audet referre
sī cui videor segnior fuisse, dum nē tibī videar, nōn labōrō
The most commonly used conjunction in temporal clauses is cum; an older spelling was quom, showing its derivation from the relative pronoun quī. The usual meaning is "when", but it can also mean "since/in view of the fact that" or "although/despite the fact that" (concessive cum). These meanings can overlap to an extent.
The combination cum ... tum sometimes introduces a temporal clause, but more often means "both ... and" or "not only ... but also" or "just as ... so also":
Hullihen, Walter (1911b). "A Chapter from an Unpublished Latin Syntax, with Prefatory Discussion (Concluded)". The Classical Weekly, Vol. 4, No. 26 (May 6, 1911), pp. 203–205.
The original meaning of ubi or ubī is "where" (it is related to ibī 'there"), and in questions it always means "where?" (the word for "when?" being quandō?); however, it can also introduce a temporal clause meaning "when" or "as soon as". In poetry, the i is usually short, but occasionally the original pronunciation ubī with a long i is found:
Normally the verb in the main clause after a historic cum-clause will be either historic present or perfect indicative. However, sometimes the main verb is in the imperfect tense, in which case it describes a situation rather than an event. In the following sentences, the main verb does not describe a pre-existing situation, but a situation which began after the action of the temporal clause:
Caesar, cum in Asiam vēnisset, reperiēbat T. Ampium cōnātum esse pecūnias tollere Ephesō ex fānō Diānae
nam cum illō vēnisset, iam Agēsilāus multīs locīs expugnātīs magnā erat praedā potītus
As with postquam, when ubi refers to a past event, it is usually followed by the perfect indicative:
The cum inversum kind of temporal clause is sometimes expressed in poetry simply by two sentences joined by et, atque or -que "and", as in the following example from Virgil:[289]
iī, dum parī certāmine rēs gerī potuit, magnum hostium numerum paucī sustinuēre
When the tense is imperfect subjunctive, it usually describes a situation already happening when the main action took place. A common way of translating it is "while":
deinde Serāpiōn cum epistulā tuā; quam prius quam aperuissem, dīxī eī tē ad mē dē eō scrīpsisse anteā
Haeduī, cum sē suaque ab iīs dēfendere non possent, lēgātōs ad Caesarem mittunt rogātum auxilium
But if one event is earlier than the other, the temporal clause has the pluperfect indicative, while the main clause is imperfect:
minus quīndecim diēs sunt, quom prō hīsce aedibus minās quadrāgintā accēpistī ā Callicle
maximā sum laetitiā adfectus, cum audīvī cōnsulem tē factum esse
The conjunctions priusquam (or prius quam) and antequam (ante quam) both mean "before". After a negative verb in the main clause, they can be translated with "until". Both are very common, although some authors prefer one (for example, Caesar almost always uses priusquam). Very rarely anteā quam is found. Another similar conjunction is prīdiē quam "on the day before".
However, the following wish has the present indicative in the temporal clause:
ante iam doctī ab Iugurthā equitēs, ubi Rōmānōrum turma īnsequi coeperat, nōn cōnfertim neque in ūnum sēsē recipiēbant
In this kind of sentence, postquam can be followed by a present tense. In one of Martial's poems, the goddess Venus describes her hold over her lover Mars:
Another reason for the subjunctive is if there is an idea of insistence ("he refused to leave before conquering..."):[253]
However, the length of time that a situation has gone on can also be expressed without using a cum clause. The main verb is present indicative:
It is even possible to have a present tense in both halves of the sentence, as in the following example from a letter to Atticus, in which Cicero complains about how few letters he's been getting since he left Rome:
permultī annī iam erant cum inter patriciōs magistrātūs tribūnōsque nūlla certāmina fuerant
sī tamen haec superī cernunt ... quandōcumque mihī poenās dabis
When the phrase is in the ablative case, as in the example below, it is known as an ablative absolute. Such phrases most commonly use the perfect participle, but the present participle can also be used:
The present infinitive (perturbārī, intrāre) is used in these last two examples, since the reminiscence is a personal one.[116]
negant sē inde prius quam captā urbe hostium reditūrōs esse
Clauses like the above are sometimes known as "clauses of equivalent action", since the action of the temporal clause is equivalent to the action of the main clause.[62] The same grammar is used for other actions which occurred at an identical time:
ipse intereā, quoad mūnīta hīberna cognōvisset, in Galliā morārī cōnstituit
dum haec Rōmae aguntur, cōnsulēs ambō in Liguribus gerēbant bellum
A third classification is whether the main verb and hence the sentence as a whole is situated in past, present, or future time.
ut Hortēnsius domum redūcēbātur ē campō, fit obviam eī C. Cūriō
This use of the subjunctive in temporal clauses of repeated action is generally not found before Livy.[154] But Cicero uses the perfect subjunctive in the following sentence, probably because he is imagining a supposed case rather than a real one:[155]
cum quaepiam cohors ex orbe excesserat atque impetum fēcerat, hostēs velōcissimē refugiēbant
^ a b c Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 362.
But the future perfect indicative is used if the event in the temporal clause precedes the main event, as in the famous poem of Catullus describing the number of kisses he will ask for from his mistress Lesbia:
nōndum centum et decem annī sunt cum dē pecūniīs repetundīs lāta lēx est
In the following, the verbs describe situations which occurred co-extensively and simultaneously. The main verb is perfect indicative, the temporal clause verb is imperfect indicative:
ō sī habērēmus illōs leōnēs, quōs ego hīc invēnī, cum prīmum ex Asiā vēnī
Grammarians usually divide the meanings into two classes: the purely temporal cum, which takes an indicative mood verb, and the circumstantial cum, which takes the subjunctive mood. The circumstantial is divided into historical, causal, and concessive uses.[24]
One of the most common uses of cum, often found in historical writing, is with the imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive, giving the circumstances in which an action took place. This is known as the "historic" or "narrative" use of cum.[27][28]
In the following example, which describes the character of Alcibiades, the pluperfect and imperfect tenses are used in the temporal clause in an iterative sentence in past time:
