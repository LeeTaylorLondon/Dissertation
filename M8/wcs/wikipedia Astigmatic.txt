Astigmatism is caused by an irregularly shaped cornea or lens. The first is called corneal astigmatism, which is the more common form, and the second is called lenticular astigmatism. "Regular" astigmatism is often described as having the cornea shaped like a rugby ball, rather than spherical like a basketball. The optics of an idealised lens of such a form would cause incoming light on different planes (corresponding to the two principal axes of the lens) to be focused at different offsets beyond the lens.
As with myopia, astigmatism should be tackled in small steps when selecting lenses for differential or normalized glasses. If only a small amount of cylinder correction is present, say 0.25 diopters, the cylinder correction can be dropped, with no other changes. Otherwise, cylinder should be reduced in small increments. If sphere is being reduced, cylinder should not be changed at the same time, and conversely, if cylinder is being reduced then sphere should not be changed. The only time that both sphere and cylinder should be changed, is when converting to the spherical equivalent.
EndMyopia Blog - Astigmatism: The Big Guide & Summary (2021)
The resulting spherical equivalent is not intended to compensate for the asymmetry of the lens, so it will introduce some directional blur.
On a prescription, there are two different conventions for specifying the cylinder. This corresponds to either quoting the spherical correction to focus red on the retina, and then the additional "minus" required to focus blue; or a spherical correction for blue, and then how much that can be reduced by for red. The average of the two, or the "spherical equivalence", is then the correction required to put green on the retina.
Regardless of how the myope reduces their lenses, the goal of each reduction is to have a small amount of "useful blur", to be cleared up with active focus and good habits.
It may be simpler to picture the effect by comparing with Chromatic Aberration. In both cases, an extra variable means different parts of the light are focused differently.
The Stenopaeic slit is a simple tool which can be used in diagnosis / measurement of astigmatism. It is simply a disk with a narrow slit which can be rotated to find the clearest image. By reducing light coming in the "wrong" direction, the spherical correction on each axis can be measured directly.
It's not possible to get everything into focus using only spherical lenses.
The link between astigmatism strength and visual acuity is weak.How your eyes and visual cortex respond to astigmatism is a greater factor in visual acuity than the number of dipoters.[2]If the standard advice for correcting astigmatism does not work for you, you may need a more gradual reduction.
When reducing cylinder value, you should never change the axis value if it has been consistent for some time. The axis only refers to the orientation in which the cylinder is affecting your eyes, and any reduction of cylinder will happen on this orientation.
The average person with medium-to-high myopia should wait until having reduced norms/diffs twice each before reducing cylinder for the first time.Then wait a minimum of 8 weeks before introducing the next spherical reduction, and wait 6 months before introducing the next cylinder reduction.

A real cornea, of course, doesn't conform to expectations. Being messier, it just has a bulge, which means that the image is not only smeared out along the axis, but is rotated, resulting in multiple (blurred) images being perceived on the retina.
The analogue of the Stenopaeic slit is this model is a simple coloured filter : by allowing only monochromatic light into the eye, the spherical correction for each colour can be measured separately.

If the object is moved away, beyond your blur horizon, so that your eye can no longer keep the green light focused,all colours will suffer myopic blur, but blue will have the worst blur. This corresponds to the directional blurin astigmatism. Adding some spherical correction would allow you to push the green back into focus.

Most diagrams of lenses show only a single vertical plane. In the real world, of course, there is a full cone of light arriving on the lens from the source object. This diagram shows two different cross-sections through the incident cone of light, aligned with the two axes. Rays in the horizontal cross-section (which contains the stronger curve) are focused earlier - at the label 'T' (for 'Tangential'). The rays in the vertical cross-section (the 'Saggital') are focused further behind, at 'S'. The other rays around the light cone are focused at points in between the two, giving an image smeared out along the axis.

The spherical equivalent of cylinder lenses may be useful, to simplify the reduced lens path. 0.50 cylinder means the power varies from 0D on one axis to 0.5D on the perpendicular axis. This can be substituted by the spherical power with the averaged value of 0.25D. For example, a full prescription of "-1.00 Sphere -1.50 Cylinder" could be converted to "-1.75 Sphere".

A common reduction is to trade 0.5 cylinder to its spherical equivalent of 0.25 sphere (of the same sign).
(Unfortunately the astigmatism diagram choose red and blue the wrong way round !)
For example, -2 sph -1 cyl (equivalently, -3 +1) is reduced to -2.25 -0.5 or -2.75 +0.5.
Uncorrected and uncompensated astigmatism appears as directional blur or double vision. Double vision also occurs when making spherical reductions. According to EM, the visual cortex compensates for irregularities in the cornea. If the double vision is just a little bit, the visual cortex can learn to fuse double vision and change the compensation.
If the red light is focused on the retina, the green/blue light is focused in front, and is blurred.
As a compromise, focusing the green light on the retina causes a little bit of myopic blue blur and hyperopic red blur. This corresponds to the "circle of least confusion" in astigmatism.

Astigmatism in young children often changes after they reach school age.[1]
If the blue light is focused correctly, green and red are focused beyond the retina and is blurred.
Astigmatism is an eye condition that means you have blur in a specific direction, or axis (technically, depending on the notation used for your prescription, the axis may indicate the angle of the eye's meridian where you have the least focusing power, or the one where you have the most). Astigmatism is compensated with cylinder lenses. A cylinder lens adds power along one particular meridian of the eye.

It can also cause headaches and eyestrain. In most cases it is easily fixed with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery.
Astigmatism is defined as the eye creating two images instead of one image on the retina. This happens when the power of the eye isn't the same in all directions, often because the front of the eye (the cornea) is shaped more like the back of a spoon than a perfect sphere. Astigmatism does not affect the health of the eye, and eyes with astigmatism can be perfectly healthy.The result is that objects look blurry, but how much blur is different in different directions, which is why people with astigmatism often have trouble reading some letters but not others.

Monocular diplopia may be induced in many individuals, even those with normal eyesight, with simple defocusing experiments involving fine, high-contrast lines.[19]
Diplopia is the simultaneous perception of two images of a single object that may be displaced horizontally or vertically in relation to each other.[1] Also called double vision, it is a loss of visual focus under regular conditions, and is often voluntary. However, when occurring involuntarily, it results in impaired function of the extraocular muscles, where both eyes are still functional, but they cannot turn to target the desired object.[2] Problems with these muscles may be due to mechanical problems, disorders of the neuromuscular junction, disorders of the cranial nerves (III, IV, and VI) that innervate the muscles, and occasionally disorders involving the supranuclear oculomotor pathways or ingestion of toxins.[3]

The appropriate treatment for binocular diplopia depends upon the cause of the condition producing the symptoms. Efforts must first be made to identify and treat the underlying cause of the problem. Treatment options include eye exercises,[2] wearing an eye patch on alternative eyes,[2][22] prism correction,[24][22][25] and in more extreme situations, surgery[5][26] or botulinum toxin.[27]If your provider diagnoses swelling or inflammation of, or around the nerve, medicines called corticosteroids may be used.

One of the first steps in diagnosing diplopia is often to see whether one of two major classifications may be eliminated. That involves blocking one eye to see which symptoms are evident in each eye alone. Persisting blurry or double vision with one eye closed is classified as monocular diplopia.[14]

Binocular diplopia is double vision arising as a result of strabismus[15](in layman's terms "cross-eyed"), the misalignment of the two eyes relative to each other, either esotropia (inward) or exotropia (outward). In such a case while the fovea of one eye is directed at the object of regard, the fovea of the other is directed elsewhere, and the image of the object of regard falls on an extrafoveal area of the retina. Acute diplopia is a diagnostic challenge. The most common cause of acute diplopia are ocular motor nerve palsies (OMP).[16]

The brain calculates the visual direction of an object based upon the position of its image relative to the fovea. Images falling on the fovea are seen as being directly ahead, while those falling on retina outside the fovea may be seen as above, below, right, or left of straight ahead depending upon the area of retina stimulated. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, the brain perceives two images of one target object, as the target object simultaneously stimulates different, noncorresponding, retinal areas in either eye, thus producing double vision.[17]

"Prisms in the treatment of diplopia with strabismus of various etiologies"
The brain naturally guards against double vision. In an attempt to avoid double vision, the brain can sometimes ignore the image from one eye, a process known as suppression. The ability to suppress is to be found particularly in childhood when the brain is still developing. Thus, those with childhood strabismus almost never complain of diplopia, while adults who develop strabismus almost always do. While this ability to suppress might seem an entirely positive adaptation to strabismus, in the developing child, this can prevent the proper development of vision in the affected eye, resulting in amblyopia. Some adults are also able to suppress their diplopia, but their suppression is rarely as deep or as effective and takes much longer to establish, thus they are not at risk of permanently compromising their vision. In some cases, diplopia disappears without medical intervention, but in other cases, the cause of the double vision may still be present.

Some people are able to consciously uncouple their eyes, either by overfocusing closely (i.e., going cross-eyed) or unfocusing.Also, while looking at one object behind another object, the foremost object's image is doubled (for example, placing one's finger in front of one's face while reading text on a computer monitor). In this sense, double vision is neither dangerous nor harmful, and may even be enjoyable. It makes viewing stereograms possible.[23]

Diplopia can also occur when viewing with only one eye; this is called monocular diplopia, or where the patient perceives more than two images, monocular polyopia.While serious causes rarely may be behind monocular diplopia symptoms, this is much less often the case than with binocular diplopia.[14] The differential diagnosis of multiple image perception includes the consideration of such conditions as corneal surface keratoconus, subluxation of the lens, a structural defect within the eye, a lesion in the anterior visual cortex, or nonorganic conditions, but diffraction-based (rather than geometrical) optical models have shown that common optical conditions, especially astigmatism, can also produce this symptom.[19]

"Prevalence of Sagging Eye Syndrome in Adults with Binocular Diplopia"
This correlation of particular areas of the retina in one eye with the same areas in the other is known as retinal correspondence. This relationship also gives rise to an associated phenomenon of binocular diplopia, although one that is rarely noted by those experiencing diplopia. Because the fovea of one eye corresponds to the fovea of the other, images falling on the two foveae are projected to the same point in space. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, two different objects will be perceived as superimposed in the same space. This phenomenon is known as visual confusion'.[18]

Temporary binocular diplopia can be caused by alcohol intoxication or head injuries, such as concussion (if temporary double vision does not resolve quickly, one should see an optometrist or ophthalmologist immediately). It can also be a side effect of benzodiazepines or opioids, particularly if used in larger doses for recreation, the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and zonisamide, and the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine, as well as the hypnotic drug zolpidem and the dissociative drugs ketamine and dextromethorphan. Temporary diplopia can also be caused by tired or strained eye muscles.[20] If diplopia appears with other symptoms such as fatigue and acute or chronic pain, the patient should see an ophthalmologist immediately.[21][22]

A right circular cylinder can also be thought of as the solid of revolution generated by rotating a rectangle about one of its sides. These cylinders are used in an integration technique (the "disk method") for obtaining volumes of solids of revolution.[3]
For a given volume, the right circular cylinder with the smallest surface area has h = 2r. Equivalently, for a given surface area, the right circular cylinder with the largest volume has h = 2r, that is, the cylinder fits snugly in a cube of side length = altitude ( = diameter of base circle).[8]
Cylindrical shells are used in a common integration technique for finding volumes of solids of revolution.[11]

with the coefficients being real numbers and not all of A, B and C being 0. If at least one variable does not appear in the equation, then the quadric is degenerate. If one variable is missing, we may assume by an appropriate rotation of axes that the variable z does not appear and the general equation of this type of degenerate quadric can be written as[15]

In the case of a right circular cylinder with a cylindric section that is an ellipse, the eccentricity e of the cylindric section and semi-major axis a of the cylindric section depend on the radius of the cylinder r and the angle α between the secant plane and cylinder axis, in the following way:

A cylindrical surface is a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line. Any line in this family of parallel lines is called an element of the cylindrical surface. From a kinematics point of view, given a plane curve, called the directrix, a cylindrical surface is that surface traced out by a line, called the generatrix, not in the plane of the directrix, moving parallel to itself and always passing through the directrix. Any particular position of the generatrix is an element of the cylindrical surface.
A cylinder (from Ancient Greekκύλινδρος (kúlindros) 'roller, tumbler')[1] has traditionally been a three-dimensional solid, one of the most basic of curvilinear geometric shapes. In elementary geometry, it is considered a prism with a circle as its base.
This formula holds whether or not the cylinder is a right cylinder.[7]
An open cylinder does not include either top or bottom elements, and therefore has surface area (lateral area)
This concept is useful when considering degenerate conics, which may include the cylindrical conics.
For a right circular cylinder, there are several ways in which planes can meet a cylinder. First, planes that intersect a base in at most one point. A plane is tangent to the cylinder if it meets the cylinder in a single element.The right sections are circles and all other planes intersect the cylindrical surface in an ellipse.[6] If a plane intersects a base of the cylinder in exactly two points then the line segment joining these points is part of the cylindric section. If such a plane contains two elements, it has a rectangle as a cylindric section, otherwise the sides of the cylindric section are portions of an ellipse. Finally, if a plane contains more than two points of a base, it contains the entire base and the cylindric section is a circle.
A = L + 2B = 2πrh + 2πr2 = 2πr(h + r) = πd(r + h)
The height (or altitude) of a cylinder is the perpendicular distance between its bases.
From a polyhedral viewpoint, a cylinder can also be seen as a dual of a bicone as an infinite-sided bipyramid.

A solid circular cylinder can be seen as the limiting case of a n-gonal prism where n approaches infinity. The connection is very strong and many older texts treat prisms and cylinders simultaneously. Formulas for surface area and volume are derived from the corresponding formulas for prisms by using inscribed and circumscribed prisms and then letting the number of sides of the prism increase without bound.[18] One reason for the early emphasis (and sometimes exclusive treatment) on circular cylinders is that a circular base is the only type of geometric figure for which this technique works with the use of only elementary considerations (no appeal to calculus or more advanced mathematics). Terminology about prisms and cylinders is identical. Thus, for example, since a truncated prism is a prism whose bases do not lie in parallel planes, a solid cylinder whose bases do not lie in parallel planes would be called a truncated cylinder.

In the treatise by this name, written c. 225 BCE, Archimedes obtained the result of which he was most proud, namely obtaining the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere by exploiting the relationship between a sphere and its circumscribed right circular cylinder of the same height and diameter. The sphere has a volume two-thirds that of the circumscribed cylinder and a surface areatwo-thirds that of the cylinder (including the bases). Since the values for the cylinder were already known, he obtained, for the first time, the corresponding values for the sphere. The volume of a sphere of radius r is .mw-parser-output .sfrac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .sfrac.tion,.mw-parser-output .sfrac .tion{display:inline-block;vertical-align:-0.5em;font-size:85%;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .sfrac .num,.mw-parser-output .sfrac .den{display:block;line-height:1em;margin:0 0.1em}.mw-parser-output .sfrac .den{border-top:1px solid}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}4/3πr3 = 2/3 (2πr3).

In projective geometry, a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex (vertex) lies on the plane at infinity. If the cone is a quadratic cone, the plane at infinity (which passes through the vertex) can intersect the cone at two real lines, a single real line (actually a coincident pair of lines), or only at the vertex. These cases give rise to the hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic cylinders respectively.[17]
The area of the top and bottom bases is the same, and is called the base area, B. The area of the side is known as the lateral area, L.
The surface area of the solid right circular cylinder is made up the sum of all three components: top, bottom and side. Its surface area is therefore,
where d = 2r is the diameter of the circular top or bottom.
If A and B have different signs and ρ≠0{\displaystyle \rho \neq 0}, we obtain the hyperbolic cylinders, whose equations may be rewritten as:
where e is the length of an element and p is the perimeter of a right section of the cylinder.[9] This produces the previous formula for lateral area when the cylinder is a right circular cylinder.

Thus, the volume of a cylindrical shell equals 2π(average radius)(altitude)(thickness).[10]
A cylindric section in which the intersecting plane intersects and is perpendicular to all the elements of the cylinder is called a right section.[5] If a right section of a cylinder is a circle then the cylinder is a circular cylinder. In more generality, if a right section of a cylinder is a conic section (parabola, ellipse, hyperbola) then the solid cylinder is said to be parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic, respectively.
In some areas of geometry and topology the term cylinder refers to what has been called a cylindrical surface. A cylinder is defined as a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line.[12] Such cylinders have, at times, been referred to as generalized cylinders. Through each point of a generalized cylinder there passes a unique line that is contained in the cylinder.[13] Thus, this definition may be rephrased to say that a cylinder is any ruled surface spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines.
If ρ{\displaystyle \rho } has a different sign than the coefficients, we obtain the imaginary elliptic cylinders:
The bare term cylinder often refers to a solid cylinder with circular ends perpendicular to the axis, that is, a right circular cylinder, as shown in the figure. The cylindrical surface without the ends is called an open cylinder. The formulae for the surface area and the volume of a right circular cylinder have been known from early antiquity.

The cylinder obtained by rotating a line segment about a fixed line that it is parallel to is a cylinder of revolution. A cylinder of revolution is a right circular cylinder. The height of a cylinder of revolution is the length of the generating line segment. The line that the segment is revolved about is called the axis of the cylinder and it passes through the centers of the two bases.
Having radius r and altitude (height) h, the surface area of a right circular cylinder, oriented so that its axis is vertical, consists of three parts:
A cylinder having a right section that is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbolais called an elliptic cylinder, parabolic cylinder and hyperbolic cylinder, respectively. These are degenerate quadric surfaces.[14]
A solid bounded by a cylindrical surface and two parallel planes is called a (solid) cylinder. The line segments determined by an element of the cylindrical surface between the two parallel planes is called an element of the cylinder. All the elements of a cylinder have equal lengths. The region bounded by the cylindrical surface in either of the parallel planes is called a base of the cylinder. The two bases of a cylinder are congruent figures. If the elements of the cylinder are perpendicular to the planes containing the bases, the cylinder is a right cylinder, otherwise it is called an oblique cylinder. If the bases are disks (regions whose boundary is a circle) the cylinder is called a circular cylinder. In some elementary treatments, a cylinder always means a circular cylinder.[2]

This equation of an elliptic cylinder is a generalization of the equation of the ordinary, circular cylinder (a = b). Elliptic cylinders are also known as cylindroids, but that name is ambiguous, as it can also refer to the Plücker conoid.

A cylindric section is the intersection of a cylinder's surface with a plane. They are, in general, curves and are special types of plane sections. The cylindric section by a plane that contains two elements of a cylinder is a parallelogram.[4] Such a cylindric section of a right cylinder is a rectangle.[4]
Let the height be h, internal radius r, and external radius R.The volume is given by
A cylinder may also be defined as an infinite curvilinear surface in various modern branches of geometry and topology. The shift in the basic meaning—solid versus surface (as in ball and sphere)—has created some ambiguity with terminology. The two concepts may be distinguished by referring to solid cylinders and cylindrical surfaces. In the literature the unadorned term cylinder could refer to either of these or to an even more specialized object, the right circular cylinder.
A tall and thin needle cylinder has a height much greater than its diameter, whereas a short and wide disk cylinder has a diameter much greater than its height.

When the principal axes of a quadric are aligned with the reference frame (always possible for a quadric), a general equation of the quadric in three dimensions is given by
If the base of a circular cylinder has a radiusr and the cylinder has height h, then its volume is given by
Finally, if AB = 0 assume, without loss of generality, that B = 0 and A = 1 to obtain the parabolic cylinders with equations that can be written as:[16]
In more generality, by the same principle, the volume of any cylinder is the product of the area of a base and the height. For example, an elliptic cylinder with a base having semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b and height h has a volume V = Ah, where A is the area of the base ellipse (= πab). This result for right elliptic cylinders can also be obtained by integration, where the axis of the cylinder is taken as the positive x-axis and A(x) = A the area of each elliptic cross-section, thus:
