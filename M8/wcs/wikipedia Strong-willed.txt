In his home race in 2006, at Surfers Paradise in Australia, he scored the first pole position of his career in Champ Cars, in front of his home crowd. However, contact from Paul Tracy in the pit lane and then an ambitious overtaking move by Sébastien Bourdais resulted in a bent left steering arm, and he fell to the back, one lap down by the time the car was repaired, eventually finishing 12th.[8]

"Power focused on ovals, overall series title". IndyCar Series. Indy Racing League. Archived from the original on 27 August 2010. Retrieved 25 August 2010. But while he could briefly revel in the victory from the pole on the 2.303-mile Infineon Raceway course, William Steven Power hasn't altered his mind-set entering the final four-race stretch in pursuit of his first championship.
Power won the final Champ Car race at Long Beach in 2008, also giving Power his first IndyCar Series win. He scored two top-five finishes in IndyCar Series races, enough for 12th overall, outpointed by teammate Oriol Servià. In the non-points event in Surfers' Paradise, Australia, Power won the pole position but crashed out while leading the race.
Will's brother, Damien Power, is a stand-up comedian.[30] Will plays the drums in his spare time, often playing the drums at charity events organized by IndyCar.[31]

In 2023, Power was scheduled to make his sports car racing debut, signing on to take part in the 2023 24 Hours of Daytona with SunEnergy1 Racing.[28] However, he would be replaced by Luca Stolz just under two weeks before the event was set to take place, as he stepped away from the ride to care for his wife after she suffered complications from a recent surgery.[29]
Power again started the season slowly but by the end of the season found his form and continued his winning ways, winning at Pocono Raceway and at the Grand Prix of Portland, increasing his streak of winning at least one race per season in IndyCar to ten seasons.
Power's season was brought to an abrupt close during practice for the 2009 Motorola Indy 300 in Sonoma however, as Nelson Philippe spun exiting Turn 3 and stalled in the middle of the racing groove. As turn 3 is a completely blind corner, taken at high speed while cresting a hill, oncoming drivers had no indication there was anything over the hill and no time to react once they got there. E. J. Viso could barely avoid him, making light contact, but Power, following just behind Viso, had nowhere to go and crashed heavily into Philippe. Both drivers were airlifted from the racetrack in short order. Power had two fractured vertebrae while Philippe suffered a fractured ankle. Both drivers were concussed in the incident and were hospitalised. Both drivers' injuries would cause them to miss the rest of 2009 season.[13]
In Long Beach, after some controversy between him and Simon Pagenaud, he finished 2nd behind Mike Conway. At Barber, mistakes cost him a shot at victory lane. In the GP of Indianapolis, a pit road penalty cost him a win. In the Indianapolis 500, he was merely a factor in the race. In the first of 2 races at Detroit, Power battled hard with Graham Rahal in the closing laps but came home with the victory for hometown Roger Penske, his team owner. The second day, his teammate won. At Texas, again a pit road penalty cost him yet another trophy, but he rallied back to finish 2nd in a dramatic finish.

To get to the lead, Power also had to pass three-time Champ Car World Series champion Sébastien Bourdais and rookie Neel Jani. Thanks to a series of late caution flags, he was able to go after each of them in turn. "I was close behind Sebastien and I knew he was quite tentative in the wet and I attacked him," Power said. "I got him on a restart. Then the next restart, I got Neel and the next restart, I got Dalziel. It's just about being aggressive at the right time and not hitting anyone". "I just drove so hard here because we've just had so much bad luck in the last few races," said Power, whose first Champ Car victory came in the 2007 opener in Las Vegas. "I didn't care; I just went hard. The car was good in the wet. It was good in the dry, and we stuck it to them." Power had podium finishes at Long Beach, Mont-Tremblant, and Mexico City and pole positions at Houston, Edmonton, Surfers Paradise, and Mexico City to place fourth in the final point standings in 2007.

Power missed the season-opening race at St. Petersburg due to the medical team believing that he had a concussion stemming from an accident that he had in one of the practices leading up to the race; it turned out that he did not have a concussion (it could have been an ear or sinus infection that was causing the concussion-like symptoms).[18] Despite this setback, Power would go on to finish second in the points behind his teammate Simon Pagenaud and won 4 of the 16 races that year: the second race at Detroit (Belle Isle), Road America, Toronto, and Pocono.[19]
Team Penske announced on 13 January 2009 that for the 2009 IndyCar Series season, Power would replace Hélio Castroneves at the helm of the No. 3 Team Penske Honda-Dallara while Castroneves attended to his federal tax evasion charges.[11] Power drove the No. 3 Team Penske Honda-Dallara to a sixth-place finish in the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, the first race of the year. Following St. Petersburg, Castroneves was acquitted of all tax evasion charges and returned to the team for the following race at the Grand Prix of Long Beach. Roger Penske came prepared for this scenario, however, and had spare cars on hand for both St. Petersburg and Long Beach, employing the option beginning at Long Beach and continuing through five more races that season. Power's new car, the No. 12 Penske Racing Verizon Wireless Honda/Dallara was officially entered for the Long Beach Grand Prix late on Friday evening and all the setup data garnered from his two sessions in the No. 3 Dallara was successfully transferred over.[12] Power stormed to a dominant pole position with the last-minute effort and ultimately finished 2nd to Dario Franchitti after leading 16 laps. Power was also entered in the same third car for the Indianapolis 500, in which he finished in fifth place after a pit crew gaffe on the final stop – while Power was running 2nd – cost him a shot at Castroneves for the victory. To reward Power for his efforts, he was retained by the team to drive in five more races in Toronto, Edmonton, Kentucky, Sonoma, and Homestead. His team was crewed by Penske's Rolex Sports Car Series team, as Power's races were specifically scheduled on their RSCS off-weekends. Power's dreams and efforts came to fruition when he captured his first IndyCar race win, driving the No. 12, in dominant fashion at the Rexall Edmonton Indy.

Will married Liz Cannon in 2010. The two met during Power's CART days when Liz joined Walker Racing as a receptionist and eventually worked in PR for the team.[32] Their son, Beau, was born in December 2016.[33]
2022 was a massive rebound year for Power after his difficult 2021. He started the year by scoring top five finishes in each of the first five races. He picked up his only win of the season at the final Detroit Grand Prix held on Belle Isle, redeeming himself from the previous year's misfortune. He picked up five pole positions on the season, including clinching a rare double pole position at the Iowa double header. His fifth pole position broke Mario Andretti's record for the most poles in IndyCar history. Power was one of five drivers heading into the season finale at Laguna Seca who were mathematically still in contention for the series title, holding a 20 point lead over Josef Newgarden and Scott Dixon and needing to finish no worse than third to clinch the championship. In the end Power would come out as victorious and win the 2022 Astor Cup and 2022 Indycar Series.

Europe beckoned and in 2003 Power joined the British Formula 3 Championship racing initially for Diamond Racing, then later for Fortec Motorsport as tight funding prevented a full campaign. A second place at Thruxton demonstrated his ability and Power mounted a full campaign in 2004 with Alan Docking Racing but finished the season in the ninth position with five podium finishes.

The resulting damage relegated him to 19th place, while title rival Franchitti led the most laps, finished 2nd, and took an 18-point advantage. Power's season ended in a violent, high-speed 15-car crash at the final race of the season in Las Vegas that claimed the life of British driver Dan Wheldon. Wheldon, Power, and 3 other drivers were taken to the hospital. He lost any chance of having the points championship after the wreck, due in part to his role in the accident (his car was damaged beyond repair) and also to the fact that the race was abandoned following the wreck. Power was later diagnosed with a vertebral compression fracture in his thoracic vertebrae and had surgery to correct the problem.
Will Power was born in Toowoomba, Queensland. The son of open-wheel racer Bob Power, Will Power started his career in Queensland driving a Datsun 1200 at Morgan Park Raceway, Warwick as well as at Carnel Raceway, Stanthorpe. In 1999 Power began driving an aging family-owned Swift SC92F in the Queensland Formula Ford Championship, winning races in a sporadic campaign. In 2000 Power ran a full campaign leading to his first title in the Swift while simultaneously racing a late-model Spectrum 07 on the Australian Formula Ford Championship, finishing a promising seventh. Still running a small family-oriented team in 2001, Power upgraded to a Stealth RF95, a Western Australian modification of a 1995 Van Diemen. Power finished second in the series behind the factory-supported Van Diemen driver, Will Davison.

In late 2005 Power joined Champ Car Team Australia at the Lexmark Indy 300 event at Surfers Paradise in Australia, which also resulted in his departure from the World Series by Renault championship even though that season was still in progress and Power ultimately ended seventh in the championship.[6] In the Indy 300 Power ran strongly until being knocked off the track by teammate Alex Tagliani.After the Surfers Paradise event, he signed a multi-year contract to race for the team, which began immediately at the next Champ Car round in Mexico City after Tagliani's teammate Marcus Marshall was released for what was described as a "serious breach of contract".

The merger of Champ Car and the IRL left his future uncertain. Power's Walker Racing team announced they would not be making the switch from Champ Car to IRL due to a lack of sponsorship.[9] However, Power later signed with KV Racing Technology, to drive the No. 8 Aussie Vineyards—Team Australia car in 2008, continuing to work with Team Australia boss Craig Gore.[10]

On 19 November 2009, Team Penske announced that Power would join the team full-time for the 2010 season with sponsorship from Verizon Wireless. Power dominantly opened the season, winning the first two races of the 2010 season at Brazil and St. Petersburg, making him the first IndyCar driver since Sam Hornish Jr. in 2001 to win the first two events of the year.[14] He went on to win from the pole at Watkins Glen International, giving Roger Penske his first IndyCar Series win at the historic track. Over the course of the season, Power scored five wins (all on road courses) and a record[15] eight pole positions. Power's efforts were rewarded with triumph in the Mario Andretti Road Course Championship, winning the inaugural Mario Andretti Trophy as the road course champion for the 2010 IndyCar Series season.

The 2013 season began very slowly for Power. In St. Petersburg, during a caution period, his car was run over by J. R. Hildebrand's, resulting in damage to both cars; Power was relegated to a 16th-place finish. In Barber, he finished 5th. In São Paulo, a blown engine and fire on the front stretch forced him to end his day early. He was competitive in Indianapolis, but he was not a factor in the race. He was involved in a crash in Detroit that took out several other cars, yet he remained in the top ten in points. Things started to pick up after Mid-Ohio. In Sonoma, after Scott Dixon collided with one of his crew members, Dixon was forced to make a drive-through penalty, handing the lead of the race to Will Power. He led the next 12 laps en route to his first win of 2013. He again collided with Scott Dixon in Baltimore that ended up having the bad end for Dixon. In Houston on Saturday, Will Power and Scott Dixon battled all day until lap 64, when a slow pit stop cost him the win. Scott Dixon ended up winning that day. Power's teammate, Helio Castroneves, had troubles throughout the day. On Sunday, Power avenged Dixon, as he dominated the race and won over Dixon. However, the win was overshadowed by Dixon's teammate, Dario Franchitti, crashing on the final lap. Power won the season finale in Fontana to end 2013 on a hot streak, winning 3 out of the last 5 races. He finished 4th in points for the season.

Power's 2017 season was not as good as his 2016 season, despite not missing any races. He only finished 5th in the points and claimed three victories: Indianapolis Grand Prix, Texas, and Pocono. However, Power did claim more pole positions in 2017 – five – compared with the one he received in 2016.[20]

Electing to remain on slick tires despite the wet conditions, Hunter-Reay gained the track position necessary to earn a much-needed win, while Power finished sixth. With the lead cut to 17 points entering the MAVTV 500 season finale on the 2-mile Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California, Power was well-positioned to earn his first championship. Those hopes took a huge hit when Power's car spun and hit the wall on lap 55 of the 250-lap race. Despite heavy damage, Team Penske got Power's car back on track long enough to gain an additional position, forcing Hunter-Reay to finish fifth or better to win the championship. Hunter-Reay ran outside of championship position for most of the race but finally moved into the top five with 21 laps remaining, eventually finishing fourth. Hunter-Reay's championship resulted in Power finishing second in the standings for the third consecutive season. Despite losing the overall championship, Power won for the third time the Mario Andretti Trophy as the 2012 road course champion.

With a few laps to go during the IndyCar Series' 225-mile return to New Hampshire Motor Speedway, amid protests from drivers and teams to not restart because of wet track conditions, the race was restarted and Power caught in the ensuing melee started by a spinning Danica Patrick. An irate Power exited his vehicle and spoke with several officials, even consulting with his race strategist Tim Cindric before displaying the finger to IndyCar director of competition Brian Barnhart. Power's immortal obscene gesture was captured on live television and met with immense support from IndyCar Series fans as well as support from members of several other team organisations in the paddock. Power's "Double Angry Birds" gesture, however, ended up landing him with a $30,000 fine, payable through public services to the league, although team owner Roger Penske said he would gladly pay the fine off. Power won the pole at the Kentucky Speedway and led the first 48 laps until he had contact with rookie Ana Beatriz as he exited his pit box.

With the departure of Helio Castroneves to Meyer Shank Racing Power became the longest-tenured member of Penske's IndyCar stable. 2021 would be one of the toughest years of Power's career and one of the toughest for Team Penske since they returned to IndyCar. Although Power scored his best opening result to the season since 2015 and was signed to a new multi-year contract with Penske that will keep him with the team through the 2023 season he struggled frequently after committing himself to a more aggressive driving style and a shake-up of crew chiefs in the Penske IndyCar paddock.[22][23] Power was nearly bumped from the 105th Indianapolis 500 before managing to survive and qualify 32nd on the grid, his lowest start to date in the race and the lowest of all the Penske drivers in 2021.[24] Power further incurred controversy during the first race in Detroit, when he led most of the race after a red flag caused by Felix Rosenqvist only to finish twentieth with five laps to go when his car's ECU overheated and prevented a restart during another red flag incident caused by Romain Grosjean, after which he blamed IndyCar for costing him the win.[25][26] In Nashville Power was involved in several wheel to wheel contact incidents with teammates Simon Pagenaud and Scott McLaughlin, one of which caused a red flag.[27] Power won his first race of 2021 at the second round on the IMS Road Course, snapping a career-long 315-day winless streak and giving Roger Penske his first win at the speedway since he purchased the facility. Power got his first pole of the season at Gateway to bring him within four of Mario Andretti's all-time IndyCar pole position record. He ultimately finished ninth in the championship.
During the 2011 IndyCar Series season he won 6 races; Barber Motorsports Park, São Paulo, the second doubleheader event at Texas Motor Speedway, Edmonton City Center Airport, Infineon Raceway, and the inaugural Baltimore Grand Prix. However, his season was far from easy. At Toronto he and championship leader Dario Franchitti touched in Turn 3 while battling for 5th, resulting in a spin for Power, which put him midpack where he was hit by former teammate Alex Tagliani. Power was irate with both drivers, particularly Franchitti, who with some level of controversy was not penalised for the contact and won the race.

Power again returned to Team Penske in the pandemic shortened 2020 season. Despite again starting the season slowly he found his rhythm late in the season and clinched his first victory at the Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio and a second at the Harvest Grand Prix, increasing his streak of winning at least one race per season in IndyCar to eleven seasons. He finished the season by getting pole position in St. Petersburg but ultimately retired during the race.

For the 2012 IndyCar Series season, Power returned to Team Penske to once again pilot the No. 12 car with teammates Castroneves and Briscoe. The road and street course heavy 2012 schedule played into Power's strength, making him one of the pre-season favorites to win the championship. After opening the season with a seventh-place finish at St. Petersburg, Power scored three consecutive victories at Barber Motorsports Park, the streets of Long Beach, and the streets of São Paulo to vault into the championship lead. Power held onto the points lead until the tenth of fifteen races when rival driver Ryan Hunter-Reay scored his third of three consecutive wins to take over the lead. Power regained the lead and built a 36-point advantage with two races remaining after strong second-place finishes at Mid-Ohio and Sonoma, coupled with two misfortunate finishes by Hunter-Reay. The season's penultimate race on the streets of Baltimore saw Power and Hunter-Reay choosing different strategies when the rain began falling.

The vast majority of Power's success in IndyCar has been on the road and street courses, where he has often shown great speed during qualifying and races. Although he won the second leg at Texas Motor Speedway, the general inability to squeeze out ovals wins hampered Power in his first three title runs. In 2014 he won at the miler in Milwaukee and finished second at Texas, helping him to seal his first title. At the end of 2015 Power had won three oval races, one each on long, intermediate, and short ovals, with the 19 road course wins being spread out over ten wins on street courses and nine on runoff road courses, with two of those being at the hybrid airport track in Edmonton. Being more seasoned on ovals Power came close to winning the 2015 Indianapolis 500 on his eighth attempt only just losing out to teammate Juan Pablo Montoya.[citation needed]

Willpower is the second studio album by the American band Today Is the Day, released on September 1994 by Amphetamine Reptile Records.[2] The album was recorded just a few months after Steve Austin's father, whom he had not seen for months at the time, died in a violent car crash. A remastered edition of the album was issued in 2007 through the then-newly formed SuperNova Records, which included the track "Execution Style", a rare extra from the Willpower sessions that remained previously unreleased up to that point.
A live performance that was recorded during the tour to promote Willpower was released as a DVD via SuperNova, under the title of Willpower Live in 2007.

Carl Nägeli's 1884 book Mechanisch-physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre, which Nietzsche acquired around 1886 and subsequently read closely,[18] also had considerable influence on his theory of will to power. Nietzsche wrote a letter to Franz Overbeck about it, noting that it has "been sheepishly put aside by Darwinists".[19] Nägeli believed in a "perfection principle", which led to greater complexity. He called the seat of heritability the idioplasma, and argued, with a military metaphor, that a more complex, complicatedly ordered idioplasma would usually defeat a simpler rival.[20] In other words, he is also arguing for internal evolution, similar to Roux, except emphasizing complexity as the main factor instead of strength.
The phrase will to power appears in "147 entries of the Colli and Montinari edition of the Nachlass. ... one-fifth of the occurrences of Wille zur Macht have to do with outlines of various lengths of the projected but ultimately abandoned book".Linda L. Williams, "Will to Power in Nietzsche's Published Works and the Nachlass", Journal of the History of Ideas 57, no. 3 (1996): 447–63, 450.
I have found strength where one does not look for it: in simple, mild, and pleasant people, without the least desire to rule—and, conversely, the desire to rule has often appeared to me a sign of inward weakness: they fear their own slave soul and shroud it in a royal cloak (in the end, they still become the slaves of their followers, their fame, etc.) The powerful natures dominate, it is a necessity, they need not lift one finger. Even if, during their lifetime, they bury themselves in a garden house![29]

In 1883 Nietzsche coined the phrase Wille zur Macht in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The concept, at this point, was no longer limited to only those intellectual beings that can actually experience the feeling of power; it now applied to all life. The phrase Wille zur Macht first appears in part 1, "1001 Goals" (1883), then in part 2, in two sections, "Self-Overcoming" and "Redemption" (later in 1883). "Self-Overcoming" describes it in most detail, saying it is an "unexhausted procreative will of life". There is will to power where there is life and even the strongest living things will risk their lives for more power. This suggests that the will to power is stronger than the will to survive.
Some interpreters also upheld a biological interpretation of the Wille zur Macht, making it equivalent with some kind of social Darwinism. For example, the concept was appropriated by some Nazis such as Alfred Bäumler, who may have drawn influence from it or used it to justify their expansive quest for power.
Adler's adaptation of the will to power was and still is in contrast to Sigmund Freud's pleasure principle or the "will to pleasure", and to Viktor Frankl's logotherapy or the "will to meaning".[37] Adler's intent was to build a movement that would rival, even supplant, others in psychology by arguing for the holistic integrity of psychological well-being with that of social equality.His interpretation of Nietzsche's will to power was concerned with the individual patient's overcoming of the superiority-inferiority dynamic.[38]

Another important influence was Roger Joseph Boscovich, whom Nietzsche discovered and learned about through his reading, in 1866, of Friedrich Albert Lange's 1865 Geschichte des Materialismus (History of Materialism). As early as 1872, Nietzsche went on to study Boscovich's book Theoria Philosophia Naturalis for himself.[4] Nietzsche makes his only reference in his published works to Boscovich in Beyond Good and Evil, where he declares war on "soul-atomism".[5]Boscovich had rejected the idea of "materialistic atomism", which Nietzsche calls "one of the best refuted theories there is".[6] The idea of centers of force would become central to Nietzsche's later theories of "will to power".

Throughout the 1880s, in his notebooks, Nietzsche developed a theory of the "eternal recurrence of the same" and much speculation on the physical possibility of this idea and the mechanics of its actualization occur in his later notebooks. Here, the will to power as a potential physics is integrated with the postulated eternal recurrence. Taken literally as a theory for how things are, Nietzsche appears to imagine a physical universe of perpetual struggle and force that repeatedly completes its cycle and returns to the beginning.[26]

As the 1880s began, Nietzsche began to speak of the "Desire for Power" (Machtgelüst); this appeared in The Wanderer and his Shadow (1880) and Daybreak (1881). Machtgelüst, in these works, is the pleasure of the feeling of power and the hunger to overpower.

To speak of just or unjust in itself is quite senseless; in itself, of course, no injury, assault, exploitation, destruction can be 'unjust,' since life operates essentially, that is in its basic functions, through injury, assault, exploitation, destruction and simply cannot be thought of at all without this character. One must indeed grant something even more unpalatable: that, from the highest biological standpoint, legal conditions can never be other than exceptional conditions, since they constitute a partial restriction of the will of life, which is bent upon power, and are subordinate to its total goal as a single means: namely, as a means of creating greater units of power. A legal order thought of as sovereign and universal, not as a means in the struggle between power complexes but as a means of preventing all struggle in general perhaps after the communistic cliché of Dühring, that every will must consider every other will its equal—would be a principle hostile to life, an agent of the dissolution and destruction of man, an attempt to assassinate the future of man, a sign of weariness, a secret path to nothingness.[33]

Opposed to a biological and voluntary conception of the Wille zur Macht, Heidegger also argued that the will to power must be considered in relation to the Übermensch and the thought of eternal recurrence—although this reading itself has been criticized by Mazzino Montinari as a "macroscopic Nietzsche".[30] Gilles Deleuze also emphasized the connection between the will to power and eternal return.Both Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze were careful to point out that the primary nature of will to power is unconscious.This means that the drive to power is always already at work unconsciously, perpetually advancing the will of the one over the other.This thus creates the state of things in the observable or conscious world still operating through the same tension.Derrida is careful not to confine the will to power to human behavior, the mind, metaphysics, nor physical reality individually.It is the underlying life principle inaugurating all aspects of life and behavior, a self-preserving force.A sense of entropy and the eternal return, which are related, is always indissociable from the will to power.The eternal return of all memory initiated by the will to power is an entropic force again inherent to all life.
Nietzsche thought that the drive is to manifest power rather than self-preservation. He thought it was most of the time incorrect that organisms live to prolong their life-time or extend the life of their species. Resistances are not painful annoyances but necessary for growth to occur. Suffering annoyances and being thwarted in ones attempt to accomplish a goal are necessary pre-conditions for our power. In 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' Nietzsche said "And life confided the secret to me: behold, it said, I am that which must always overcome itself." Nietzsche thought it necessary to have the power to discharge ones strength and thus fulfil ones purpose in the manifestation of will to power.

Some of the misconceptions of the will to power, including Nazi appropriation of Nietzsche's philosophy, arise from overlooking Nietzsche's distinction between Kraft ("force" or "strength") and Macht ("power" or "might").[3] Kraft is primordial strength that may be exercised by anything possessing it, while Macht is, within Nietzsche's philosophy, closely tied to sublimation and "self-overcoming", the conscious channeling of Kraft for creative purposes.
Thus, Dumont's pleasure in the expansion of power, Roux's internal struggle, Nägeli's drive towards complexity, and Rolph's principle of insatiability and assimilation are fused together into the biological side of Nietzsche's theory of will to power, which is developed in a number of places in his published writings.[21] Having derived the "will to power" from three anti-Darwin evolutionists, as well as Dumont, it seems appropriate that he should use his "will to power" as an anti-Darwinian explanation of evolution. He expresses a number of times[22] the idea that adaptation and the struggle to survive is a secondary drive in the evolution of animals, behind the desire to expand one's power – the "will to power".

This reading was criticized by Martin Heidegger in his 1930s courses on Nietzsche—suggesting that raw physical or political power was not what Nietzsche had in mind.This is reflected in the following passage from Nietzsche's notebooks:
These ideas of an all-inclusive physics or metaphysics built upon the will to power do not appear to arise anywhere in his published works or in any of the final books published posthumously, except in the above-mentioned aphorism from Beyond Good & Evil, where he references Boscovich (section 12). It does recur in his notebooks, but not all scholars treat these ideas as part of his thought.[25]
My idea is that every specific body strives to become master over all space and to extend its force (its will to power) and to thrust back all that resists its extension. But it continually encounters similar efforts on the part of other bodies and ends by coming to an arrangement ("union") with those of them that are sufficiently related to it: thus they then conspire together for power. And the process goes on.[31]
Nietzsche's "Will to power" and "Will to seem" embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of Féré and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness (Ohnmacht).[36]

Wilhelm Roux published his The Struggle of Parts in the Organism (Der Kampf der Teile im Organismus) in 1881, and Nietzsche first read it that year.[7] The book was a response to Darwinian theory, proposing an alternative mode of evolution. Roux was a disciple of and influenced by Ernst Haeckel,[8] who believed the struggle to survive occurred at the cellular level. The various cells and tissues struggle for finite resources, so that only the strongest survive. Through this mechanism, the body grows stronger and better adapted. Rejecting natural selection, Roux's model assumed a neo-Lamarckian or pangenetic model of inheritance.

Beyond Good and Evil has the most references to "will to power" in his published works, appearing in 11 aphorisms.[16] The influence of Rolph and its connection to "will to power" also continues in book 5 of Gay Science (1887) where Nietzsche describes "will to power" as the instinct for "expansion of power" fundamental to all life.[17]
In Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl compared his third Viennese school of psychotherapy with Adler's psychoanalytic interpretation of the will to power:
In Smallville (Season 1, Episode 17), the Lex Luthor character reveals that his father gave him a copy of the book for his tenth birthday.
Léon Dumont (1837–77), whose 1875 book Théorie scientifique de la sensibilité, le plaisir et la peine Nietzsche read in 1883,[11] seems to have exerted some influence on this concept. Dumont believed that pleasure is related to increases in force.[12] In The Wanderer and Daybreak, Nietzsche had speculated that pleasures such as cruelty are pleasurable because of exercise of power. But Dumont provided a physiological basis for Nietzsche's speculation. Dumont's theory also would have seemed to confirm Nietzsche's claim that pleasure and pain are reserved for intellectual beings, since, according to Dumont, pain and pleasure require a coming to consciousness and not just a sensing.

Alfred Adler borrowed heavily from Nietzsche's work to develop his second Viennese school of psychotherapy called individual psychology. Adler (1912) wrote in his important book Über den nervösen Charakter (The Neurotic Constitution):
Nietzsche's early thinking was influenced by that of Arthur Schopenhauer, whom he first discovered in 1865. Schopenhauer puts a central emphasis on will and in particular has a concept of the "will to live". Writing a generation before Nietzsche, he explained that the universe and everything in it is driven by a primordial will to live, which results in a desire in all living creatures to avoid death and to procreate. For Schopenhauer, this will is the most fundamental aspect of reality – more fundamental even than being.

Nonetheless, in his notebooks he continues to expand the theory of the will to power.[23] Influenced by his earlier readings of Boscovich, he began to develop a physics of the will to power. The idea of matter as centers of force is translated into matter as centers of will to power. Nietzsche wanted to slough off the theory of matter, which he viewed as a relic of the metaphysics of substance.[24]

Alfred Adler incorporated the will to power into his individual psychology. This can be contrasted to the other Viennese schools of psychotherapy: Sigmund Freud's pleasure principle (will to pleasure) and Viktor Frankl's logotherapy (will to meaning). Each of these schools advocates and teaches a very different essential driving force in human beings.

Opposed to this interpretation, the "will to power" can be understood (or misunderstood) to mean a struggle against one's surroundings that culminates in personal growth, self-overcoming, and self-perfection, and assert that the power held over others as a result of this is coincidental. Thus Nietzsche wrote:

The will to power (German: der Wille zur Macht) is a concept in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. The will to power describes what Nietzsche may have believed to be the main driving force in humans. However, the concept was never systematically defined in Nietzsche's work, leaving its interpretation open to debate.[1] Usage of the term by Nietzsche can be summarized as self-determination, the concept of actualizing one's will onto one's self or one's surroundings, and coincides heavily with egoism.[2]

In contemporary Nietzschean scholarship, some interpreters[who?] have emphasized the will to power as a psychological principle because Nietzsche applies it most frequently to human behavior. However, in Nietzsche's unpublished notes (later published by his sister as "The Will to Power"), Nietzsche sometimes seemed to view the will to power as a more (metaphysical) general force underlying all reality, not just human behavior—thus making it more directly analogous to Schopenhauer's will to live. For example, Nietzsche claims the "world is the will to power—and nothing besides!".[28] Nevertheless, in relation to the entire body of Nietzsche's published works, many scholars[who?] have insisted that Nietzsche's principle of the will to power is less metaphysical and more pragmatic than Schopenhauer's will to live: while Schopenhauer thought the will to live was what was most real in the universe, Nietzsche can be understood as claiming only that the will to power is a particularly useful principle for his purposes.

Other Nietzschean interpreters[who?][32] dispute the suggestion that Nietzsche's concept of the will to power is merely and only a matter of narrow, harmless, humanistic self-perfection.They suggest that, for Nietzsche, power means self-perfection as well as outward, political, elitist, aristocratic domination. Nietzsche, in fact, explicitly and specifically defined the egalitarian state-idea as the embodiment of the will to power in decline:

Schopenhauer's will to live (Wille zum Leben) thus became a subsidiary to the will to power, which is the stronger will. Nietzsche thinks his notion of the will to power is far more useful than Schopenhauer's will to live for explaining various events, especially human behavior—for example, Nietzsche uses the will to power to explain both ascetic life-denying impulses and strong life-affirming impulses as well as both master and slave morality. He also finds the will to power to offer much richer explanations than utilitarianism's notion that all people really want to be happy, or the Platonist notion that people want to be unified with the Good.[citation needed]

Nietzsche began to expand on the concept of Machtgelüst in The Gay Science (1882), where in a section titled "On the doctrine of the feeling of power",[9] he connects the desire for cruelty with the pleasure in the feeling of power. Elsewhere in The Gay Science he notes that it is only "in intellectual beings that pleasure, displeasure, and will are to be found",[10] excluding the vast majority of organisms from the desire for power.

"Human beings do not seek pleasure and avoid displeasure. What human beings want, whatever the smallest organism wants, is an increase of power; driven by that will they seek resistance, they need something that opposes it - displeasure, as an obstacle to their will to power, is therefore a normal fact; human beings do not avoid it, they are rather in continual need of it".[35]

Some scholars believe that Nietzsche used the concept of eternal recurrence metaphorically.But others, such as Paul Loeb, have argued that "Nietzsche did indeed believe in the truth of cosmological eternal recurrence."[27] By either interpretation the acceptance of eternal recurrence raises the question of whether it could justify a trans-valuation of one's life, and be a necessary precursor to the overman in his/her perfect acceptance of all that is, for the love of life itself and amor fati.[citation needed]

Nietzsche read William Rolph’s Biologische Probleme around mid-1884, and it clearly interested him,[13] for his copy is heavily annotated.[14] He made many notes concerning Rolph. Rolph was another evolutionary anti-Darwinist like Roux, who wished to argue for evolution by a different mechanism than natural selection. Rolph argued that all life seeks primarily to expand itself. Organisms fulfill this need through assimilation, trying to make as much of what is found around them into part of themselves, for example by seeking to increase intake and nutriment. Life forms are naturally insatiable in this way.

On a more negative note, Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine called the album "a slog of pop clichés and self-absorbed preening", criticizing how "every track can be boiled down to a handful of catchphrases, a fuzzed-up club beat, and some sort of glitchy, mid-song breakdown".[43] Additionally, Brian Mansfield of USA Today noted that the album, at times, "veers often into high-def electro-pop silliness", although he positively noted the collaborative effort with "big-name stars".[44]

On August 13, 2012, will.i.am held a "wrap party" in celebration of cease production of #willpower.[6] A flyer, which unveiled a silhouetted variant of the album artwork, invited fans for an open event, which would feature performances from artists who have worked on the new album and others. The party also included a private listening party of #willpower attended by invited guests, and asked listeners to pick the next single, which would succeed as the third American single from the album. There was a rumor that the next single chosen would be "Scream and Shout" featuring Britney Spears, which she later confirmed on Twitter. The party featured a red carpet event, which featured the new album artwork on wallpapers surrounding the event. It features the back of Adams' head imposed on a white background, imprinted with the words "#WILLPOWER" across.[7] The party also featured experimental light and pyrotechnics which will be used on Adams' upcoming tour to support willpower.[8] The event was attended by Lindsay Lohan, Meagan Good, Nicole Scherzinger, Steve Aoki, Wilmer Valderrama, Corey Feldman, David Faustino and many others.[9] The party itself was held at the Avalon Hollywood, where will.i.am, Steve Aoki and DJ Poet played sets of music which included music from their respective albums and new renditions of popular charting songs.[10] Also at the party, will.i.am performed "Fresh Shit" (later mixed as "Freshy" on the final version of #willpower) and "Dirty Beat" (scrapped from the album) for the very first time,[11] along with many other samples from #willpower. This included a brand new mix for "Great Times" (scrapped from the album in favour of another mix of the song),[12] which was previously released as a single in November 2011. Along with a medley of #willpower songs and "This Is Love",[11] he also performed notable remixes of Gotye's 2011 hit single, "Somebody That I Used to Know",[11] and Kanye West's "Mercy".[13]

In April 2012, Italian car manufacturer Lancia commissioned two commercials, both featuring a track from #willpower, to promote their new line of Lancia Delta cars. The song, "Mona Lisa Smile", features Nicole Scherzinger, and was lent by will.i.am himself.[4] However, the final version on the album is called "Smile Mona Lisa", and does not credit Scherzinger, though a different song called "Far Away from Home" does instead.[5]
In the lead-up to the album's release in Australia, Perth-based online newspaper Perth Now ran a competition to win CD copies of #willpower before its release on April 19.[14]

Controversy arose due to identical segments present in the song "Let's Go" and the track "Rebound" by Arty and Mat Zo. Arty claimed on Twitter that Interscope Records failed to ask permission from Anjunabeats before sampling "Rebound".[47] Anjunabeats has since released a statement that although Arty was credited in the sleeve notes, this is not a valid form of obtaining permission to use the sample.[48] This statement was made in regard to will.i.am's comments made to the Associated Press in which he stated, "You can't steal if you credited somebody."[49] In a later interview will.i.am admitted that the sample had not been properly credited. Explaining the situation, Will said "I wrote this song to Rebound this last year. I got in touch with Arty and showed it to him, did a different version to it 'cause I asked him [to] make it newer 'cause I don't just wanna take your song and rap over it. But we did that, we collaborated. But in a year's time, time's gone by [and] we preferred writing over and using the [original] rebound. Something happened and the clearance… hopefully we resolved the issue."[50] The song was taken out of the re-release, and replaced by the single "Feelin' Myself".
