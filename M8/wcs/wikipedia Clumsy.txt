During the early development of the 1980s series, he tends to get mad at things that cause him to trip and fall, with the most notable example being the Season 2 episode, "The Kaplowey Scroll". In the intro sequence (the ones where the Smurfs run away from Gargamel), it takes Clumsy longer to get around the words "THE SMURFS".
At many times during the modern "non-canonical" Smurfs films, Smurfette cares a lot about Clumsy and occasionally worries about him.
In "Kitchen Klutz", Clumsy saves Chef Smurf's life and Chef decides to appoint Clumsy as the new chef. Throughout the beginning of the episode, Chef is very patient as Clumsy is new to the food business and does his best to assign him simple job. They're partnership, however, becomes strained when Clumsy reveals that it was him who accidentally pushed the giant boulder and Chef does not want to see Clumsy in his kitchen anymore. They're on good terms after that as Clumsy's new dish, which he made when Chef got knocked out with a rolling pin, and Chef allows Clumsy to cook again. In "Adventures In Smurfsitting", Chef gets mad at Clumsy and Dimwitty for ruining his cooking (and calls both of them "good-for-nothings", although this was likely out of sheer frustration). In "Waffle Wednesday", Clumsy is a part of Chef's plan to end Lily's waffle business.

Despite their flaws, Clumsy and Dimwitty are able to do their Fire Brigade job well. They are the most knowledgeable about firefighting and can tell you whatever it is about their job.
Sometimes his clumsiness even serves to get the Smurfs out of a bad situation. Despite the chaos he’s creating, it’s impossible to be angry with Clumsy for long. He might be the most sensitive, kind, and empathetic Smurf of all. The others tend to gravitate to him when they have problems, because he’s such a great listener. Clumsy and Smurfette are particularly close, and can sit and talk for ages.
In the 1981 cartoon series, this version of Clumsy is an expy of Dopey with his intelligence level being on the gullible and distracted side (similar to the comic book version of Flighty), compared to his mainline comic book/2021 TV series counterpart having the same intelligence level as the other Smurfs.

Despite being Brainy's best friend, there have been a few instances where Clumsy is annoyed with him, such as in "King Smurf", "Soup A La Smurf", "The Magic Fountain", "Smurf Me No Flowers", and "Smurf On Wood".
Clumsy tries out liquid soap and burps out a bubble.

However, Clumsy and Dimwitty have gone under a few conflicts with each other. In "Papa Times Two", they argue about who will drive, but the "fake" Papa Smurf confirms that Clumsy can drive, since apparently Dimwitty is too dumb, but according to him, Clumsy can't drive. In "You're Fired!", they briefly disband from the fire brigade due to an argument about each other's flaws but make up when they are jealous of Smurfette taking over for them. In "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb", Dimwitty spends more time with Brainy than Clumsy when Brainy had used a brain-boosting formula, but it instead made him stupid, making the Clumsy jealous. When Brainy drinks a potion that makes him smart again, Clumsy and Dimwitty become friends once more.
In the 2021 cartoon show, he and Dimwitty interact a lot as they are part of the Smurf Village Fire Brigade. They are almost always seen with each other and are established to be best friends in "You're Fired!" and "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb".

Clumsy appears in The Smurfs: A Christmas Carol. He is one of the Smurfs shown opening their gifts (a new hat) from Papa Smurf. Later, in the vision the Ghost of Christmas Present (Brainy) shows Grouchy, Clumsy accidentally causes a chain of events that leads to the village Christmas tree bursting into flames.
In the 2011 Smurfs movie, Grace Winslow confided with Clumsy that she too was accident-prone until she met her husband Patrick and encouraged him that he can be more than just his name.

In "Flying Ace", he and Handy attempt to stop Handy's out of control plane. They successfully stop it before it crashes or one of them gets hurt.
One of Clumsy's biggest supporters is Papa Smurf. He considers Clumsy's sensitivity and recognizes that his clumsiness is not (naturally) controllable, rarely getting angry at him for such accidents. Because of this, Clumsy is often defended by Papa, who also urges the Smurfs to give him a fair chance in everyday group activities, such as smurfball games. When Papa Smurf was given the news that Clumsy had presumably died in "Clumsy Luck", he sat on a mushroom and sobbed, mourning "[his] poor Clumsy". After it's revealed he is alive and well, Papa cries tears of joy and claims he's "never been so happy to see a Smurf in [his] life".
Ironically, Clumsy is one of the Smurfs who often ends up saving the others. While these rescues can sometimes be due to a fortunate accident, Clumsy is capable of some quick thinking on his own.
Clumsy had a southern accent and was often seen with Brainy. Clumsy's main interest is collecting rocks and he has full boxes (and/or piles) of them in his house. He is often seen looking for rocks and even claims that he has a lucky one. He also gave a box of them to Nanny Smurf as a housewarming gift in "A House For Nanny". In the 1980s series, Clumsy's catchphrases are "Whoops!", "Golly!", "Gosh!", and "Gee". He also frequently stutters by saying "Uh".
In the 2011 Smurfs movie, Clumsy is one of the few Smurfs that travel through time to modern-day New York City. He is accidentally taken to the Winslow's' apartment by Patrick Winslow and tries to escape their dog Elway by hiding in the bathroom. Patrick's wife Grace rescued Clumsy from being in the toilet, though his presence scared her at first. Eventually the other Smurfs find him in the apartment and reason with them to let them stay with them long enough in order to open the portal back to their own time with the next blue moon. However, Papa Smurf, seeing Clumsy in a vision seemingly failing to catch a dragon wand, has Clumsy stay behind in the apartment with Grace while the others go look for a "stargazer". Clumsy only goes along with Grace in order to retrieve the other Smurfs who are holed up in Patrick's office, but upon reaching the FAO Schwarz toy store they depart and head inside to search for the "stargazer". Inside the store, Clumsy is mistaken for a toy by some girls and is brought to the cashier in order to scan him for a price tag.
In this movie, he appears for a brief moment with Handy Smurf as he has finished his latest invention. Clumsy touches some of his tools and ends up in casts when they hit him.
In "The Majestic 5", he was one of the Smurfs who was a part of the rescue team to save the Smurfs from Gargamel. He and the other four Smurfs end up saving the day.
Clumsy is one of Smurfette's love interests. Smurfette is the nicest to him, only minding his clumsiness if he breaks something of hers or gets her clothes dirty. During competitions, much like the Smurfic Games, Smurfette will willingly pick Clumsy as her partner, believing that having fun is all that matters. He is also one of the Smurfs that Smurfette has been the most romantically affectionate to, notably being one of few that she imagines marrying in "Smurfily Ever After".
Clumsy can’t cross a room without falling flat on his face. He is constantly dropping things and tripping over his own feet. If you go to his house, you’ll notice he doesn’t own anything fragile or made from glass. That’s because he breaks stuff all the time—crushing Vanity’s flowers, knocking the weights off of Hefty’s dumbbells, spilling Chef’s stew, and so on. One might think Clumsy would be covered in casts and bandages, but miraculously, he never hurts himself.

In The Smurfs 2 video game, Clumsy is a playable character from the start.
Children's books																																							The Smurfs: Meet Smurfette																															The Smurfs: Behold The Power Of Gargamel																															The Smurfs: A Very Clumsy Tale																															The Smurfs: A Smurfin' Big Adventure																															The Smurfs (Play-a-Sound Book)																															A Little Smurf Bedtime Story																															The Smurfs: The Snow Giant
He is one of the most recognizable Smurf characters, along with Smurfette, Papa Smurf, and select others.
Clumsy is easily identified by the droop of his hat, as well as how often he's seen tripping and dropping things. In the comics prior to Smurfs: The Village Behind The Wall, Clumsy was not seen with a droop on his hat. Every time there is a competition of some sort, Clumsy is not considered to be a good player due to his clumsiness.
He cherishes his friends and tends to go along with what other Smurfs are doing. Despite his clumsy nature, he loves to help out around the village.
The villagers of Smurfy Grove, an arriving Papa, Hefty, Brainy, and Clumsy were subsequently captured by Gargamel and taken back to Gargamel's castle to be drained of their magical energy. Fortunately, Smurfette, whom Gargamel had left behind, tricked the wizard, using her unique attributes to drain the magic out of Gargamel and back into the Smurfs. Unfortunately, the process caused her to revert to her original form of a lump of clay, which the Smurfs and Smurf Girls took back to Smurf Village in order to mourn. However, the inherent magic of all 200 Smurfs restored Smurfette to life, which Clumsy was the first to discover and celebrate. All the Smurfs then joined in a massive celebration.

He, Brainy Smurf, Papa Smurf, Grandpa Smurf, Baby Smurf, Smurfette, Hefty Smurf, Handy Smurf, Greedy Smurf, Grouchy Smurf, Lazy Smurf, Vanity Smurf, Jokey Smurf, Painter Smurf, Wild Smurf, Sassette, Snappy, and Smoogle are the only characters who time traveled during Season 9 with the Time Scrolls.
During "The Smurfic Games", Clumsy was unwanted by the two teams of East and West, so Smurfette (upset by Clumsy's mistreatment) pairs with him to make a team of their own, with Clumsy as the captain and Hefty and Handy leading East and West, respectively. After 9 events, each team was tied with 3 games won, much to the shock of fellow Smurfs since Clumsy and Smurfette were the underdogs.
The tiebreaker then came: the Smurfathon. When Jokey set off one of his explosive "gifts", Clumsy just blocked his ears, letting Hefty and Handy get a head start. Both of them were then caught in a mishap along the way, and Hefty saves Handy, thus allowing Clumsy to unknowingly overtake. In the end, Clumsy wins the Smurfic Games, being the first Smurf to do so.
In "I'm Off To The Circus!", he stops Gargamel and Azrael from stealing the Smurfs, who disguised themselves as acrobats. Clumsy, just learning about this, defeats them using his clumsiness.

Clumsy and Dimwitty appear to live together in the 2021 TV series, living in the fire brigade house. However, Clumsy is seen in a separate house in "A Smurfy Christmas", likely meaning that they have two houses.

Otherwise, the two are very good friends and Smurfette would do anything to defend Clumsy from unfair treatment, as shown in "Clumsy Luck" after Clumsy accidently damage Vanity's mirror for seven years of bad luck when Brainy begins to announce his punishment of seven years bad luck, but Smurfette stood up for Clumsy and claims that those superstitious nonsense are just accidents. But after Clumsy accidently launch Baby Smurf, he was forced to be quarantine which cost him into missing the meteorite. Smurfette felt sorry for him she decided to bail him out and invite him herself, but the meteor destroyed his house, then Smurfette and the Smurfs believed he is gone while she blames Brainy for being responsible for Clumsy while showing she dose love him just the way he was before (While unaware Clumsy left but later came back when he thought there better off without him). After the funeral, Clumsy reveals to them that he's still alive while Smurfette kissed him as a sign of true love while she's happy that he survived.
Clumsy is voiced by the late Anton Yelchin in the 2011 live-action movie and is the main protagonist. Unlike the 1981 series, he lacks a Southern accent. He does, however, have a Southern accent in Smurfs: The Lost Village, voiced by Jack McBrayer.

Clumsy is the only Smurf to have honors in the Smurfic Games, the games based on the human Olympics.
In the Smurfs and the Magic Flute and the comic books (prior to "Smurfs: The Village Behind The Wall" onwards), his trademark attribute (the droop on his hat) isn't seen and can only be distinguishable when his clumsiness is identified.

In "Clumsy In Command", Clumsy is given the opportunity to lead the expedition to gather purple Pandy root on Mount Majestic. He only receives the support (and team) of the Smurflings, as his fellow Smurfs are much too worried about the danger his clumsiness could cause on such a hike. Brainy argues that he should lead the expedition and Grandpa Smurf suggests making his own team, turning the expedition into a race.
He is very friendly to (and fond of) animals and even becomes friends with various clumsy creatures of the forest, such as a bird called the Hopping crane, a Pussywillow Pixie named Pansy, and a little monkey which he called "Chimpy". In Smurfs: The Lost Village, he is shown to befriend Spitfire the Dragonfly. In the episode "Fuzzle Trouble", Clumsy temporarily adopts a pet Fuzzle.
Dopey and Clumsy are often confused by comic book readers to be the same character due to a misinterpretation that Dopey's French name (Schtroumpf Bêta) is claimed to be an early name for Clumsy's French name, while Clumsy's 1981 TV series counterpart who was an expy of Dopey Smurf had a similar personality to the actual Dopey Smurf. This is proven to be false as Clumsy and Dopey are shown as separate characters in the comic books such as "Doctor Smurf" and "Smurf Heroes".
Being the klutz of the village, Clumsy doesn't really have a specific job. He does help out whenever the Smurfs are building or fixing something, but there are times his involvement could potentially cause a lot of trouble (like a severe physical injury).
In the 2021 TV series, they do not seem to interact much, and when they do, it is not always positive; in "The Smurfs Show", he is among the Smurfs that call Brainy "annoying", and in "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb", he threatens to break his glasses because Brainy (who had used a brain boosting spell which instead made him dumb) becomes Dimwitty's best friend. However, they are still on slightly better terms than most of the other Smurfs, as Brainy comforts Clumsy when he fears he will smell the forget-me-what flower in "Forget Me What?".
Eventually, he is rescued and brought back home to the Winslows' apartment where he is told to stay put a second time. However, when Papa Smurf was captured by Gargamel in the magic bookstore, he told the other Smurfs with him not to come back for him, but since Papa Smurf never told Clumsy to do the same, Clumsy decided that he was going to rescue Papa Smurf, which encouraged the other Smurfs to do the same. During the final battle with Gargamel and the dragon wand, Clumsy leaps to grab it as it falls from Gutsy Smurf's grasp, but as he seemingly fails to grab it, he succeeds in doing so and saves the other Smurfs present by blasting Gargamel with the wand and causing him to land in a pile of garbage bags. By the end of the movie, Papa Smurf expresses how proud he is of Clumsy.

Clumsy Smurf (original French name Schtroumpf Maladroit) is one of the main characters of the 1980s Smurfs cartoon show and the 2021 Smurfs cartoon show, and a minor character of the Smurfs comic books.
An unnamed Smurf known as "Schtroumpf avec la tete pres du bonnet" (which translates to "Smurf with his head near the hat" with the Smurf having a droop on his hat) in the 100 Smurfs Poster looks similar to Clumsy's 1981 TV series design, with the Smurf having a droop on his hat. Despite this, Clumsy Smurf did not make an official appearance in Smurf media prior to the animated adaptation of "The Smurfs And The Magic Flute" and would eventually receive a similar design bearing close resemblance to the unnamed Smurf in the 1981 TV series.

In the Sicredi & Smurfs web series, Clumsy was once more seen without the droop on his hat and was often seen with Brainy, Smurfette, and Hefty similar to the 1980s series, Smurfs: The Lost Village, and the first set of comic book stories part of The Girls' Village Collection.
Clumsy can't do a cartwheel, as proven in "Sideshow Smurfs".
After encountering a number of the strange plants and animals of the Forbidden Forest where the village is hidden, Clumsy and his friends are forced into a tunnel network due to Gargamel tricking a group of Dragonflies. Clumsy soon begins to panic, but he and his friends eventually make their way out of the tunnels, thanks in part to a rabbit named Bucky. That night, while sitting around a campfire, the four speculate on the nature of the mystery Smurfs, before taking a picture using Brainy's assistant Snappy. They then came to a river that they soon sailed on by building a raft, with Hefty providing Clumsy with a life preserver. Following another encounter with Gargamel, the group ended up in the river and fell over a waterfall and ended up washing up on the shore of a small lake.

While he has no known "Best Smurf Friend" in the comics, in the 1981 TV series, however, Clumsy's best friend, is Brainy Smurf. Despite his rather vain personality, Brainy does think of Clumsy as a good friend, even if he won't admit it. Clumsy and Brainy are often paired up when they have to do something in the village, and whenever Brainy has a scheme, Clumsy is his partner. He acts in an assistant role to Brainy, carrying books for him, helping with potions, or listening while he talks. In the episode "The Smurfiest Of Friends", Clumsy states that he thinks Brainy is fun and implies Brainy shares jokes with him often. He seems to admire Brainy for his "intelligence", urging him to escape from the evil imp Buddy without him because "the world needs [him]" in the aforementioned episode. After they escape, Clumsy decides that he'd rather spend time with Brainy than with his other friends back at the village, even telling him that he loves him. He also thinks Brainy to be brave and that he has good ideas, as shown in "A Bell For Azrael".
In promotional material and merchandise that followed the cartoon's debut in 1981, Clumsy was often depicted with what seemed to be an earlier design. This design depicts him with a backwards hat and nearly closed eyes, the original stock art using a pose seen on Lazy's model sheet as the base. A licensing sheet from the Wallace Berrie company also labels said art as both 'Dimwit' (implicating that his 1981 TV series incarnation is an expy of Dopey Smurf) and 'Clumsy'.
In the 1981 TV series, Clumsy often refers to animals using diminutives, such as 'mousy' and 'birdie'.

As his name implies, Clumsy is very accident-prone. For example, in his comic appearances like "Can't Smurf Progress", he accidentally hits Brainy with a mallet while attempting to do annual reparations for the Smurfs' houses, while in the 2021 cartoon series episodes like "DRIIINNGGGGG!", "Kitchen Klutz", and "The Smurfs Show", he is shown to be inept on activities and jobs such as cooking, his job as part of the Smurf Village Fire Brigade, and playing cards. He dislikes being useless towards the other Smurfs whenever his clumsiness gets the better of him, and is determined on finding ways on looking useful, in episodes like "Clumsy Not Clumsy" and "Adventures In Smurfsitting".
In the comic book series and the 2021 TV series, he does not seem to be best friends with Brainy as they don't interact often. Instead, he is established to be best friends with Dopey as he is not portrayed as an expy of Dopey as in the 1981 TV series.

In Smurfs: The Lost Village, Clumsy's personality is a bit more on the eccentric side. He often does or says things that result in eye rolls, eyebrow-raising, or (usually intended) laughter from his friends. He is also upbeat, yet jumpy and very prone to anxiety. His anxious tendencies are reflected in moments such as him having a panic attack in the tunnels, with his mannerisms being slightly similar to Scaredy Smurf. He is still brave and good-hearted.
In "An Unsmurfy Friendship", Storm chooses Clumsy on her smurfball team.
Clumsy makes an appearance in the game as one of the twelve characters you will play. His special power is turning on the flashing light of his fire engine kart to overtake its competitors.

In "Clumsy Not Clumsy", Clumsy (whose name has been changed to Graceful from the magic amulet Gargamel gave him) and Smurfette dance and Smurfette is impressed with his dancing moves.
In "Predictable Smurfs", Clumsy saves the Smurfs from Gargamel during their annual Spring regatta and thus receives the winner's trophy as a reward (which Lazy has no objection to).
Following an argument between his three teammates in which Clumsy briefly attempts to become involved, the four are captured by the Smurfs of the lost village, and soon learn a shocking truth: they are in fact Smurf Girls not created by Gargamel. After suffering through the initial curiosity-including swarming and prodding-of the female Smurfs, Clumsy is taken along by Smurfstorm on a flight on Spitfire to check on the whereabouts of Gargamel, who is revealed to be heading for the wrong landmark. During the flight, they are attacked by Gargamel's vulture Monty and Smurfstorm hands the "reins" to Clumsy despite his lack of confidence with regards to his flight ability. However, he proves to have a unique knack for flying, surprising both Stormy and he, and they make their escape from the wizard. Unfortunately, during this flight he reveals Smurfette's origins to a paranoid Stormy, who confronts Smurfette upon their return to Smurfy Grove.

Brainy's team think Clumsy doesn't have a chance at winning but fail to succeed in anything besides bickering with each other. When a boulder they attempt to climb on dislodges from its spot, the group is trapped rolling down the mountain until it comes to a stop. With quick thinking and rock-collecting knowledge, Clumsy and the Smurflings are able to stabilize the boulder and save Brainy's team. After both parties arrive back at the village, Clumsy receives a trophy, which he attempts to share with Brainy.
When Clumsy and Smurfstorm first met in Smurfs: The Lost Village, Clumsy explains who Gargamel was and when they ride Spitfire the Dragonfly is respected by Storm for his quick thinking and ability to ride the insect.
Clumsy does not appear in this game. However, he is mentioned by Poet Smurf, with the latter claiming that he is not up to the challenge to stop Gargamel's Vileaf.
In The Smurfs and The Smurfs 2, this version of Clumsy is soft-spoken, but still remains friendly and happy. He dislikes being left behind by the other Smurfs. He overestimates himself at times, and dreams of being a hero, which he becomes in the first movie.
In the 2021 series, Clumsy (alongside Dimwitty) work as part of the Smurf Village Fire Brigade.

Clumsy Smurf appears in The Smurfs 2 as one of the main characters. His latest accident causes him traveling to present-day Paris with Papa Smurf, Grouchy, and Vanity to rescue Smurfette from Gargamel and the Naughties.
Clumsy is one of the main characters in the film Smurfs: The Lost Village, and part of a "Team Smurf" that also includes Smurfette, Hefty, and Brainy. He is the first Smurf to appear in the film, pushing a wheelbarrow of smurfberries into Smurf Village only to trip up. He later drops a vile of liquid created by Brainy's Smurfy Thing Finder based on an analysis of Hefty's strength which proves to have explosive properties. When the four friends later go Smurfboarding, Clumsy jumps into a barrel and rolls along instead of surfing; the group's subsequent encounter with a mysterious Smurf and Gargamel leads to them being grounded by Papa Smurf. However, all four later sneak out of the village in order to investigate a mysterious lost village of Smurfs they learned of due to Gargamel's magic.
Despite his flaws, he is overall the most empathetic, kind, and sensitive Smurf. He has also proven to be very heroic when the other Smurfs are in danger.

In the Smurfs' Village game, Clumsy is bought back to the village at Level 20 and often gives tasks. Clumsy has his own hut that has an almost collapsed roof, hence containing a mini game where he has to get some toolboxes to fix it. In this game, Clumsy often trips, so he will reward you 180 XP if you help him back up (you tap him when there is a red exclamation point above his head). Although, if tapped too late, he will not give the player any XP. His hut costs 30 smurfberries.

"Sensory integration and activities of daily living in children with developmental coordination disorder"
Moderate to extreme difficulty doing physical tasks is experienced by some people with dyspraxia, and fatigue is common because so much energy is expended trying to execute physical movements correctly. Some dyspraxics have hypotonia, low muscle tone, which can also detrimentally affect balance.[11]

Collier first described developmental coordination disorder as "congenital maladroitness". A. Jean Ayres referred to developmental coordination disorder as a disorder of sensory integration in 1972,[68][69] while in 1975 Sasson Gubbay, MD, called it the "clumsy child syndrome".[42][70][71] Developmental coordination disorder has also been called "minimal brain dysfunction", although the two latter names are no longer in use.

Evidence from research and clinical practice indicates that DCD is not just a physical disorder, and there may be deficits in executive functions, behavioural organisation and emotional regulation that extend beyond the motor impairments and which are independent of diagnoses of co-morbidities.[8] In addition to the physical or motor impairments, developmental coordination disorder is associated with problems with memory, especially working memory.[9] This typically results in difficulty remembering instructions, difficulty organizing one's time and remembering deadlines, increased propensity to lose things or problems carrying out tasks which require remembering several steps in sequence (such as cooking). Whilst most of the general population experience these problems to some extent, they have a much more significant impact on the lives of dyspraxic people.[10] However, many dyspraxics have excellent long-term memories, despite poor short-term memory.[10] Many dyspraxics benefit from working in a structured environment, as repeating the same routine minimises difficulty with time-management and allows them to commit procedures to long-term memory.

In adulthood, in addition to a childhood history as above, the condition may manifest as a difficulty learning new motor skills or applying skills in a different or busy environment, poor organisation and time management skills, missed deadlines and lateness for appointments (or earliness as a coping strategy), and awkward pauses before answering in conversation. There is often a history of underachievement in education or the workplace. Although skills can be acquired, such as neat handwriting, handwriting speed will then be much lower than expected.[7]

Developmental coordination disorder (DCD), also known as developmental motor coordination disorder, developmental dyspraxia or simply dyspraxia from the word 'praxis' meaning to do or act, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired coordination of physical movements as a result of brain messages not being accurately transmitted to the body. Deficits in fine or gross motor skills movementsinterfere with activities of daily living. It is often described as disorder in skill acquisition, where the learning and execution of coordinated motor skills is substantially below that expected given the individual's chronological age. Difficulties may present as clumsiness, slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills (e.g., catching objects, using cutlery, handwriting, riding a bike, use of tools or participating in team sports or swimming). It is also often accompanied by difficulty with organisation and/or problems with attention, working memory and time management.

Poor balance[12][13] (sometimes even falling over in mid-step). Tripping over one's own feet is also common.
Students with developmental coordination disorder struggle most in visual-spatial memory. When compared to their peers without motor difficulties, students with developmental coordination disorder are seven times more likely than typically developing students to achieve very poor scores in visual-spatial memory.[39] As a result of this working memory impairment, students with developmental coordination disorder have learning deficits as well.[40]

A diagnosis of DCD is reached only in the absence of other neurological impairments such as cerebral palsy,[61][44] multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease.
A baseline motor assessment establishes the starting point for developmental intervention programs. Comparing children to normal rates of development may help to establish areas of significant difficulty.

DCD is a lifelong neurological condition that is expected to be as common in males as it is in females.[4][5][6] Currently however, the diagnosis criteria favours males which results in over 80% of males being diagnosed before the age of 16 compared to only 22% for females.[citation needed]

People who have publicly stated they have been diagnosed with developmental coordination disorder include:
"Educational outreach and collaborative care enhances physician's perceived knowledge about Developmental Coordination Disorder"
Other names include developmental apraxia,[42] disorder of attention and motor perception (DAMP)[42][70] dyspraxia,[44] developmental dyspraxia,[42][72][73] "motor learning difficulties",[42][70] perceptuo-motor dysfunction,[42][70][69] and sensorimotor dysfunction.[42]

Developmental coordination disorder is classified in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a motor disorder, in the category of neurodevelopmental disorders.[62]
Developmental motor coordination disorder is characterised by a significant delay in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills and impairment in the execution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness, or inaccuracy of motor performance. Coordinated motor skills are substantially below that expected given the individual's chronological age and level of intellectual functioning. Onset of coordinated motor skills difficulties occurs during the developmental period and is typically apparent from early childhood. Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in functioning (e.g., in activities of daily living, school work, and vocational and leisure activities). Difficulties with coordinated motor skills are not solely attributable to a Disease of the Nervous System, Disease of the Musculoskeletal System or Connective Tissue, sensory impairment, and not better explained by a Disorder of Intellectual Development.
However, a person with DCD is unlikely to have all of these conditions. The pattern of difficulty varies widely from person to person; an area of major weakness for one dyspraxic can be an area of strength or gift for another. For example, while some dyspraxics have difficulty with reading and spelling due to dyslexia, or with numeracy due to dyscalculia, others may have brilliant reading and spelling or mathematical abilities. Co-morbidity between ADHD and DCD is particularly high; the overlap between the two disorders is believed to be about 50% (approximately half of people with DCD have ADHD).[33][34][35]

Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) research has found that students with developmental coordination disorder and normal language skills still experience learning difficulties despite relative strengths in language. This means that, for students with developmental coordination disorder, their working memory abilities determine their learning difficulties. Any strength in language that they have is not able to sufficiently support their learning.[31]

DCD is known to co-occur with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Most commonly, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) co-occurs in an estimated 50% of cases, but other co-occurring conditions are Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Developmental Speech and Language Disorder and Developmental Learning Disorder.[1]

Sensory processing disorder (SPD) concerns having oversensitivity or undersensitivity to physical stimuli, such as touch, light, sound, and smell.[36] This may manifest itself as an inability to tolerate certain textures such as sandpaper or certain fabrics such as wool, oral intolerance of excessively textured food (commonly known as picky eating), being touched by another individual (in the case of touch oversensitivity) or it may require the consistent use of sunglasses outdoors since sunlight may be intense enough to cause discomfort to a dyspraxic person (in the case of light oversensitivity). An aversion to loud music and naturally loud environments (such as clubs and bars) is typical behavior of individuals with dyspraxia who have auditory oversensitivity, while only being comfortable in unusually warm or cold environments is typical of a dyspraxic with temperature oversensitivity. Undersensitivity to stimuli may also cause problems, as individuals do not receive the sensory input they need to understand where their bodies are in space. This can make it even more challenging to complete tasks.[37] Dyspraxics who are undersensitive to pain may injure themselves without realising it. Some dyspraxics may be oversensitive to some stimuli and undersensitive to others.[38]

Some people with the condition find it helpful to find alternative ways of carrying out tasks or organizing themselves, such as typing on a laptop instead of writing by hand, or using diaries and calendars to keep organized.[66] A review completed in 2017 by Cochrane of task-oriented interventions for DCD resulted in inconsistent findings and a call for further research and randomized controlled trials.[67]

In children, DCD may exhibit as delays in early development of sitting, crawling, walking; poor ability or difficulties with childhood activities such as running, jumping, hopping, catching, sports and swimming; slowness; frequent tripping and bruising; poor handwriting skills; difficulties with self care; difficulties with skills such as using cutlery or tying shoelaces; poor spatial understanding; difficulty following instructions; poor time management; and often losing objects.[7]

Assessments for developmental coordination disorder typically require a developmental history,[42] detailing ages at which significant developmental milestones, such as crawling and walking,[43][44][45] occurred. Motor skills screening includes activities designed to indicate developmental coordination disorder, including balancing, physical sequencing, touch sensitivity, and variations on walking activities.[citation needed]

However, research in the British Journal of Special Education has shown that knowledge is severely limited in many who should be trained to recognise and respond to various difficulties, including developmental coordination disorder, dyslexia and deficits in attention, motor control and perception (DAMP).[45] The earlier that difficulties are noted and timely assessments occur, the quicker intervention can begin. A teacher or GP could miss a diagnosis if they are only applying a cursory knowledge.
If the child does also experience comorbidities such as intellectual or other developmental disability; motor coordination is still disproportionally affected.[42]

The exact proportion of people with the disorder is unknown since the disorder can be difficult to detect due to a lack of specific laboratory tests, thus making diagnosis of the condition one of elimination of all other possible causes/diseases. Approximately 5–6% of children and adults are affected by this condition.[2][63][43][64][65] and approximately 2% are severely affected.[7]
Raine stated that there was a kind of "Carnival atmosphere" to the whole album and that many of the lyrics he wrote were set at the circus or a carnival.[14] Clumsy's songs feature the striking vocals of lead vocalist Raine Maida, who utilizes an often jarring falsetto technique: Maida jumps from lower octaves in his vocal range to higher ones.Raine's vocals provide most of the melody of the songs, with guitars quieted down in this album compared to Naveed, their previous album. This aspect of singing has become the staple sound of the band, continuing with this fashion in their next studio album Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch, and since lost on their 2005 album Healthy in Paranoid Times.. In a January 1997 interview, the band stated that then new bassist Duncan Coutts, who also plays cello, keyboards and sings background vocals, influenced the sound on Clumsy even though he doesn't have any songwriting credits.[19] He broadened the band's palette of sounds. Given those new parameters, the band couldn't help but change their sound.[8]

Recording sessions for the yet untitled album began on February 8, 1996. The band was asked to record the Beatles song "Tomorrow Never Knows" for the soundtrack to the upcoming movie The Craft after several bands they had played with on tour knew them to play it well live. The song was recorded on the very first day of recording with Arnold Lanni and was mixed by Ralph Sall for the soundtrack. They then proceeded to pare down the twenty tracks they had written to the twelve they wanted to record. "The Story of 100 Aisles", originally called "Anacin", was the first song recorded and has a sound closer to Naveed than any other song on the album. "We just wanted to go in and give all these songs ideas their own life and play with them and rearrange them and all that until we're completely happy with it." said Duncan Coutts, "If they sound just like Naveed or if they don't, it wasn't a huge concern. We just wanted to make each song the best it could be."[12]

The tour's second leg began on May 2, with the band playing two shows in Michigan before going off to Europe to promote the album's recent release there. The band returned and toured across the United States, only dipping into Canada to play at the very first Summersault festival. The North American tour continued until the end of September 1997 when Our Lady Peace joined Everclear as an opening act with whom they would tour until the end of 1997.[26]

The album was recorded in two parts. Five or six tracks were recorded and finished by April 1996 so the band could review them. These included the base tracks for "Clumsy", "Hello Oskar", "Carnival", "Shaking", "Let You Down" and "Sleeping In", which didn't make the album.[13] The band's feedback directed the next set of songs recorded around June, which included "Superman's Dead" anda re-recording of "Hello Oscar".[14] Raine Maida said in an interview, "We took a lot of time experimenting. The album was really done in three months. We took another two months to really go back over stuff and re-record. It's neat to look back and know the extra time we took was important to the record."[15] Around this time (April), the working title of the album was Propeller, as Raine explained, "as in, that which causes forward movement." This was probably as a testament to the band's evolution since their debut album.[16] Another working title was Trapeze, named after the song that didn't make the album. The cover art proves that this title came close to being chosen. The name was changed to Clumsy in early September. Recording wrapped up by the end of that month.[17] The album was mastered at Gateway Studios in Portland, Maine by Bob Ludwig.[18]

While on tour in support of Naveed the band attempted to begin writing for their next album. Like most bands, the challenges of writing a successful follow-up album was found to be difficult as each member now approached the writing process from a different set of experiences, personal goals, and influences from their time spent touring. Collaborations between band members and the co-writing producer broke down and writing sessions at the producer's studio resulted in nothing of use. The decision was made by Raine Maida that the way to resolve the situation was to change the line-up. It was either Mike Turner or Chris Eacrett. The concern then turned to what challenges would be faced with the task of replacing either. With Turner threatening legal recourse and Maida's school friend Duncan Coutts a bass player in his own band, the choice was simple. Immediately following the band's opening stint with Van Halen, Coutts was asked to join the band to be its new permanent bass player. "I don't want to call our old bass player Chris a weak link...I think he's a talented musician, just different from us." claimed Maida at the time of the announcement. Turner would be later fired from the group in the first week of writing with producer Bob Rock (Aerosmith, Metallica, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue) on a subsequent album.

In early 1996, Our Lady Peace's American label, Relativity Records, in a decision to switch to an urban format, eliminated ten label positions in their Rock category, including OLP.[20] They moved to another Sony-owned label, Columbia Records for the release of Clumsy's first single in Canada, "Superman's Dead". Columbia would handle all of the band's releases in both Canada and the United States.

As touring continued, the band began writing again with Duncan. One of the first songs they wrote was the eventual concert favorite "Trapeze", which they played live along with two other newly written songs "Home" and "Disgusted".[6] "Disgusted" would evolve into "Spider Gun" and eventually became the track "Big Dumb Rocket". In December 1995 the band began intensive writing and demoing sessions in a rented rehearsal space. Despite coming up with several new ideas, the band found that writing while on tour was very difficult because they couldn't give the songs their undivided attention and most of their early ideas were scrapped because the band wasn't satisfied with them.[7] "Trapeze" would make it to recording but the track was eventually cut and has yet to be released.[8]

Pre-production for the album was set to begin in January 1996. Producer Arnold Lanni noticed the band's discontent with the songs they were writing. "I went down to see them and knew it wasn't happening", he recalled. "All their friends and family were calling them up. You sell that many records, you're on everybody's A-list, everybody blows sunshine up your butt and sometimes you believe the hype. We had to pull the plug on that scenario."[9] At Lanni's suggestion, the band and him traveled to Duncan's rural lakeside cottage near Muskoka, Ontario, in order to concentrate on writing and recording demos for the album without distractions from family, friends or the media.[7] While there, the band lived together in the cottage surrounded by instruments. A tape recorder was left on in the house all day to pick up any ideas being played. Lanni and the band members would usually play ice hockey in the afternoon and collaborate on songs in the evening and into the night. By the end of their stay, around 20 songs had been written.[10] When they returned to the Toronto studio in February, according to Mike Turner, "When we came back to record, it just came together".[11]

"Clumsy" was ranked at number 34 on Rolling Stone’s "50 Best Songs of 2016" list by Rob Sheffield, who said that "[the song was a] should-been-a-hit highlight from [Spears's] comeback album". He went on to say that "no singer [had] ever brought that much resonance to the word "oops"" referring to the song's lyrics and considered Britney a "TRL princess turned Vegas queen [who was revisiting] the high-energy disco-ball hysteria of her youth".[35]

"Clumsy" was written by Talay Riley, Warren "Oak" Felder and Alex Niceforo, with production being handled by the latter two; Mischke served as a vocal producer. Spears, Riley, Felder, Zaire Koalo, Trevor Brown and Mischke provided crowd vocals on the track, which were recorded at 158 Studios, Westlake Village, California, and at House of Blues Studio, Encino, California.[15] Musically, "Clumsy" portrays a "synth-laden"[16] electro track,[17] with a "folksy verse stomp"[18] and a "futuristic club beat."[16] It additionally incorporates "stomping drums and finger snaps" in its instrumentation, as well as doo-wop "hand-claps and soulful vocal riffs as it builds to an explosive electronic drop."[12] In an interview with radio show The Cooper Lawrence Show, the singer confirmed that she and her team "literally went into the booth together and did all the claps [...] all the sound effects are real, they're from us, our feet and everything, it's all real, so we all did it together, it's like very old-school."[19] Joey Nolfi, writing for Entertainment Weekly, saw "Clumsy" as being " sonically in-line with songs heard on 2011's Femme Fatale and 2013's Britney Jean."[12] The Guardian's Alex Macpherson opined that "its rapacious giddiness shares something of the same spirit as Ariana Grande's 'Greedy'."[20]
In late 2016, while promoting her ninth studio album Glory, Spears said that she wanted to explore new musical styles.[8] She described the project as her "most hip-hop album," explaining, "[...] there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted to do for a long time now, and I just haven't really done that."[9] She collaborated with Talay Riley, who had previously co-written Iggy Azalea's "Bounce" (2013) and Nick Jonas' "Levels" (2015).[10] After the release of the first single "Make Me..." and the promotional single "Private Show" on August 8, 2016, Spears and PopCrush announced that "Clumsy" was going to be made available as the second promotional track from the Glory as an instant grant for those who pre-ordered the album.[10][11] It was subsequently released on August 11, 2016 for digital download and streaming.[12][13]

Neil McCormick of The Telegraph classified the track as "equating clumsiness with bumping and grinding sex," where "[Spears] switches back and forth between the two approaches so frequently that it almost sound like a duet between sweet and tough alter egos."[29] The National's Si Hawkins confessed that "Clumsy" is "a return to quirky form,"[30] while John Murphy of musicOMH emphasized that the song was an "undoubted highlight".[31] Jonathan Riggs, penning for Idolator, opined that "although none of the more manic moments match the frenzied brilliance of 'Toxic' (but what could, really?), Britney keeps control of the pulsating 'Clumsy'."[32] While noting that "Britney holds her own on the sexually charged 'Clumsy'," Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine suggested that Christina Aguilera would match better with the recording.[33] Entertainment Weekly's Nolan Feeney observed that "the generic bass drop" of the track is a "missed opportunity."[34] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian was largely positive towards "Clumsy", mentioning that it "brings out grinding, Justice-style metallic synths, verses that jitter and hop uncontrollably, beery chants and an absurd moment when Spears' voice gets pitch-shifted thither and yon. But if much of her post-Blackout work seems to have had an absence of character as its end goal, [...] Spears sounds like she’s having the time of her life sparring with and riding the kitchen-sink beat.[20]
Musically, "Clumsy" portrays a "synth-laden" electro song which incorporates doo-wop hand claps, stomping drums, finger snaps, soulful vocal riffs and an electronic drop in its instrumentation. Spears also alludes to her 2000 single "Oops!... I Did It Again" during the track's breakdowns. The lyrical themes of the recording delve on sex and how the singer and her suitor are clumsy during intimate moments. Writers from AllMusic, The Boston Globe, musicOMH and Rolling Stone considered the track a highlight of Glory while the latter listed it as one of the best songs of 2016. Commercially, "Clumsy" charted at number 142 in France, where it remained for two weeks on the SNEP chart. Spears included "Clumsy" on the set list of her Piece of Me Tour (2018).[2]

Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone considered it "one moment that sums up the fantastic new Britney Spears album" and "a perfect Britney song, done and dusted in three minutes. Ooops, she did it again."[17] Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, declared that "some of the highlights [on the album] are the silliest songs", citing "Clumsy" as an example and defining it as a "swinging" track.[25] Josh Duboff of Vanity Fair felt "Clumsy" portrays "the most straight-forward 'club' track" and further explained that "the song is innocuous and propulsive."[26] Digital Spy's Lewis Corner named the recording a "four-to-the-floor banger" [...] with an infectious clap-beat."[27] Andrew Unterberger of Spin stated that "the rubbery track is among Britney’s most fun songs of recent years."[18] Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle, declared, "It's both a relief and a joy to hear Spears return to her former glory with the empowering, x-rated 'Clumsy' lyrics."[23] Maura Johnston of Boston Globe labelled "Clumsy" as a highlight from Glory.[28]
"Clumsy" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her ninth studio album, Glory (2016). It serves as the record's second promotional single, being released on August 11, 2016 for digital download and streaming by RCA Records and Sony Music. It was provided as an instant gratification track for those who pre-ordered Glory. "Clumsy" was written by Talay Riley, Warren "Oak" Felder and Alex Niceforo, while production was handled by Felder and Alex Nice; Mischke served as a vocal producer.

We got guys in the studio and we clapped and dosey-do and made it really bluesy and funky and did everything really old school and real.

Lyrically, the recording finds Spears "[fumbling] through the early throes of love."[16] Adam R. Holz of Plugged In claimed that the song is "about Spears and a partner 'bangin' all over [the] bedroom,'[21] which can be seen in the lines, "Clumsy, bangin' all over this bedroom again and again."[12] Sasha Geffen of MTV added that during the track, Spears shows off her "flirty side" with lines like, "I love how you go down."[22] Spin's Andrew Unterberger explained that the lyrics of "Clumsy" "offer varying degrees of double-entendred literalness within the clumsiness conceit, as Britney’s lack of physical dexterity leads to her 'slippin’ off this dress."[18] Writing for Bustle, Alexis Rhiannon noticed that the text of the recording is "frankly pretty filthy" and "also essentially a description of pure sex."[23] For the pre-chorus, Spears sings, "Call me a fool/ Call me insane/ But don't call it a thing/ Closer to you/ Closer to pain/ It's better than far away", following which she repeats "clumsy" as a hook.[24] During every breakdown of the track, the singer "playfully squeals", "Oops!",[12] making reference to her 2000 song "Oops!... I Did It Again".[22] Throughout the track, Spears delivers vocals in her "nasal come-on tone" as noted by Rolling Stone's Jon Blistein.[16] The critic furthermore opined that the song "marks a rhythmic, almost swing-inspired turn for Spears."[16]

Even though Britney Spears' eighth studio album, Britney Jean (2013), had a lackluster commercial performance,[3] her Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Piece of Me, was successful.[4] In September 2014, she posted a picture of herself in a recording studio.[5] During an interview with Extra, a month later, she said that she was working "very slowly, but progressively" on new music.[6] In 2015, she released the single "Pretty Girls", which featured Iggy Azalea,[4] but clarified that she did not have plans to release another studio album that year.[7] She explained that her children were her priority rather than music.[7]

Brown specializes in personal and intimate works detailing moments in relationships. He writes and draws his comics in sketchbooks, and his drawing style mirrors the strain and awkwardness of the situations he depicts. His first self-published book, Clumsy (2002), appeared seemingly out of nowhere to grab attention from cartoonists and comics fans, alike. Brown wrote and drew Clumsy while at the School of the Art Institute.[3]

Established as a sensitive chronicler of bittersweet young-adult romance and nonsensical superhero parody, Brown's current direction remains split between autobiographical material, examining the minutiae of everyday life, whatever humorous fiction he feels in the mood for, and a wide range of fiction subjects in his series Sulk. Brown has also created two series of books set in the Star Wars expanded universe (under the "Legends" & "Infinities" brands).

The album received positive reviews from critics, with some noting it as a nostalgic culmination of the band’s previous works.[8] In a positive review, Emily Carter of Kerrang! called it "dreamy", "nostalgic", and "sentimental".[7] AllMusic reviewer Neil Z. Yeung praised the album for paying homage to pop punk predecessors such as Yellowcard, Fall Out Boy, Lit, and Blink-182, while praising the album's blend of the band's modern style and their past pop-punk music, mentioning the presence of "catchy hooks, bright energy, and . . . the style that won All Time Low a legion of devoted scene fans."[10]

The album comes after 2017's Last Young Renegade. In January 2019, the band began creating the record in drummer Rian Dawson's home studio in Nashville, Tennessee with Zakk Cervini and Andrew Goldstein.[3] A majority of the writing and recording process took place in August 2019 at a mansion located in Palm Desert, California, (usually referred to by the band as the "marble mansion") that the band rented and lived in for a few months along with most of the team that worked on Wake Up, Sunshine.[4][5] To finish the album, All Time Low members Alex Gaskarth and Jack Barakat rented a cabin with Cervini and Goldstein in Big Bear Lake, California.[3][1]
