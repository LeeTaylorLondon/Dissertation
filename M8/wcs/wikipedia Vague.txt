In the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations.The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be "void for vagueness" and unenforceable.This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid "explicit" or "objectionable" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the vagueness doctrine and in Europe as the principle of legal certainty.

Subvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or "true on at least some precisifications".[5]

Vagueness is a major topic of research in philosophical logic, where it serves as a potential challenge to classical logic. Work in formal semantics has sought to provide a compositional semantics for vague expressions in natural language. Work in philosophy of language has addressed implications of vagueness for the theory of meaning, while metaphysicians have considered whether reality itself is vague.

One possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague.Consider Peter Unger's example of a cloud (from his famous 1980 paper, "The Problem of the Many"): it is not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it is part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one won't know how to answer.So perhaps one's term 'cloud' denotes a vague object precisely.This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to Gareth Evans's short paper "Can There Be Vague Objects?" (1978).[11] Evans's argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. "Princeton = Princeton Borough"), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right.Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.
Another theoretical approach is known as "supervaluationism". This approach has been defended by Kit Fine and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of "truth value gaps". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be "made precise" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.[4]

Given a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate "supertrue" as meaning "true on all precisifications".This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. "Frank is bald", where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the tautologies of sentential logic, such as "Frank is bald or Frank is not bald", will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either "Frank is bald" or "Frank is not bald" will be true.Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can "rescue" them is seen as a virtue.

A fourth approach, known as "the epistemicist view", has been defended by Timothy Williamson (1994),[7] R. A. Sorensen (1988) [8] and (2001),[9] and Nicholas Rescher (2009).[10] They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is due to one's ignorance. For example, in the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old; some people are ignorant of this fact.

Vagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases, judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept.Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc.Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as biological sex can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from transsexuals' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see intersex).
Van Inwagen, Peter. 1990 Material Beings. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.
In linguistics and philosophy, a vague predicate is one which gives rise to borderline cases. For example, the English adjective "tall" is vague since it is not clearly true or false for someone of middling height. By contrast, the word "prime" is not vague since every number is definitively either prime or not. Vagueness is commonly diagnosed by a predicate's ability to give rise to the Sorites paradox. Vagueness is separate from ambiguity, in which an expression has multiple denotations. For instance the word "bank" is ambiguous since it can refer either to a river bank or to a financial institution, but there are no borderline cases between both interpretations.
Many scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance species in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as ring species.Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases.As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is "vague" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding huskies and wolves: are they dogs? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.

Still by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving Leibniz's law or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend ontological vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, Peter van Inwagen (1990),[12] Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).[13]
Subvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has "truth-value gluts". According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon.[6] Of a borderline case of "bald man" it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.
Dominic Hyde and Mark Colyvan (2008) “Paraconsistent Vagueness: Why Not?” Australasian Journal of Logic 6: 107–121.
One theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician Lotfi Zadeh. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between "perfect falsity", for example, the statement "Bill Clinton is bald", to "perfect truth", for, say, "Patrick Stewart is bald". In ordinary logics, there are only two truth-values: "true" and "false". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing an infinite number of truth-values along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by "1", and perfect falsity by "0". Borderline cases are thought of as having a "truth-value" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) [2] and Dorothy Edgington (1993).[3]

The concept of vagueness has philosophical importance. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of "right" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances precising definitions.[1]

Π-terms return a type.So what is the type of their return value?Well, there must be a type that contains types.A type that contains other types is called a "universe".It is often written with the symbol U{\displaystyle U}.Sometimes there is a hierarchy of universes, with "U0{\displaystyle U_{0}} : U1{\displaystyle U_{1}}", "U1{\displaystyle U_{1}} : U2{\displaystyle U_{2}}", etc..

A complex type ⟨a,b⟩{\displaystyle \langle a,b\rangle } is the type of functions from entities of type a{\displaystyle a} to entities of type b{\displaystyle b}. Thus one has types like ⟨e,t⟩{\displaystyle \langle e,t\rangle } which are interpreted as elements of the set of functions from entities to truth-values, i.e. indicator functions of sets of entities. An expression of type ⟨⟨e,t⟩,t⟩{\displaystyle \langle \langle e,t\rangle ,t\rangle } is a function from sets of entities to truth-values, i.e. a (indicator function of a) set of sets. This latter type is standardly taken to be the type of natural language quantifiers, likeeverybody ornobody (Montague 1973, Barwise and Cooper 1981).[full citation needed]

Obviously, terms that compute to the same term are equal.So, assuming "x : nat", the terms "x + (1 + 4) : nat" and "x + (4 + 1) : nat" are equal because they both reduce to "x + 5 : nat".When two terms are equal, they can be substituted for each other.Equality is a complex topic in type theory and there are many kinds of equality.This kind of equality, where two terms compute to the same term, is called "judgmental equality".
C-monoids (categories with products and exponentials and one non-terminal object) correspond to the untyped λ-calculus (observed independently by Lambek and Dana Scott around 1980);
"term elimination" rules define the other functions like "first", "second", and "R".
Some combinations of types are equivalent to other combinations of types.When functions are considered "exponentiation", the combinations of types can be written similar to algebraic identities.[10]Thus, 0+A≅A{\displaystyle {\mathbb {0} }+A\cong A}, 1×A≅A{\displaystyle {\mathbb {1} }\times A\cong A}, 1+1≅2{\displaystyle {\mathbb {1} }+{\mathbb {1} }\cong {\mathbb {2} }}, AB+C≅AB×AC{\displaystyle A^{B+C}\cong A^{B}\times A^{C}}, AB×C≅(AB)C{\displaystyle A^{B\times C}\cong (A^{B})^{C}}.
Much of the current research into type theory is driven by proof checkers, interactive proof assistants, and automated theorem provers. Most of these systems use a type theory as the mathematical foundation for encoding proofs, which is not surprising, given the close connection between type theory and programming languages:
Thompson, Simon (1991). Type Theory and Functional Programming. Addison–Wesley. ISBN 0-201-41667-0.
The programming language ML was developed for manipulating type theories (see LCF) and its own type system was heavily influenced by them.
Likewise, there is no double negation.There is no term of type Π A . ((A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →{\displaystyle \to } A.(Note: Intuitionistic logic does allow ¬¬¬A→¬A{\displaystyle \lnot \lnot \lnot A\to \lnot A} and there is a term of type (((A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }) →{\displaystyle \to } (A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }).)
In type theory, every term has a type.A term and its type are often written together as "term : type". A common type to include in a type theory is the Natural numbers, often written as "N{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }" or "nat".Another is Boolean logic values.So, some very simple terms with their types are:
add : nat→{\displaystyle \to }nat→{\displaystyle \to }nat ::= R (λ n:nat . nat→{\displaystyle \to }nat) (λ n:nat . n) (λ g:nat→{\displaystyle \to }nat . (λ m:nat . S (g m)))
WARNING: This interpretation can lead to a lot of confusion.A type theory may have terms "true" and "false" of type "bool", which act like a Boolean logic, and at the same time have types ⊤{\displaystyle \top } and ⊥{\displaystyle \bot } to represent "true" (provable) and "false" (disproven), as part of a intuitionistic logic for proposition.
⊢{\displaystyle \vdash } S  : nat →{\displaystyle \to } nat
Sometimes, a type theory will add a few axioms.An axiom is a judgement that is accepted without a derivation using the rules of inference.They are often added to ensure properties that cannot be added cleanly through the rules.
The logic operators "for all" and "exists" led Per Martin-Löf to invent dependent type theory.
Earlier, we saw that function application is written by putting the parameter after the function term.So, if we want to call the above function with the parameter "5" of type "nat", we write:
Type theory is also widely used in formal theories of semantics of natural languages,[20][21] especially Montague grammar[22] and its descendants. In particular, categorial grammars and pregroup grammars extensively use type constructors to define the types (noun, verb, etc.) of words.

The judgements enforce that every term has a type.The type will restrict which rules can be applied to a term.

The Boolean type has exactly 2 canonical terms.The type is usually written "bool" or "B{\displaystyle \mathbb {B} }" or "2{\displaystyle \mathbb {2} }".The canonical terms are usually "true" and "false".
Type theory has a built-in notation of computation.The following terms are all different:
In set theory, the Axiom of Choice is an axiom and is controversial, particularly when applied to uncountable sets.In type theory, the equivalent statement is a theorem (type) and is provable (inhabited by a term).
The unit type has exactly 1 canonical term.The type is written "⊤{\displaystyle \top }" or "1{\displaystyle \mathbb {1} }" and the single canonical term is written "*".
If the canonical terms are always "a=a", but "x+1" does not compute to the same term as "1+x", how do we create a term of "x+1 = 1+x"? We use the "R" function.(See §Natural Numbers above.)The "R" function's argument "P" is defined to be "(λ x:nat . x+1 = 1+x)".The other arguments act like the parts of an induction proof, where "PZ : P 0" becomes the base case "0+1 = 1+0" and "PS : P n →{\displaystyle \to } P (S n)" becomes the inductive case.Essentially, this says that when "x+1 = 1+x" has "x" replaced with a canonical value, the expression will be the same as "reflexivity (x+1)".This application of the function "R" has type "x : nat →{\displaystyle \to } x+1 = 1+x".We can use it and the function "J" to substitute "1+x" for "x+1" in any term.In this way, the identity type is able to capture equalities that are not possible with judgmental equality.
Although the initial motivation for category theory was far removed from foundationalism, the two fields turned out to have deep connections. As John Lane Bell writes: "In fact categories can themselves be viewed as type theories of a certain kind; this fact alone indicates that type theory is much more closely related to category theory than it is to set theory." In brief, a category can be viewed as a type theory by regarding its objects as types (or sorts), i.e. "Roughly speaking, a category may be thought of as a type theory shorn of its syntax." A number of significant results follow in this way:[18]
Many programs that work with type theory (e.g., interactive theorem provers) also do type inferencing.It lets them select the rules that the user intends, with fewer actions by the user.
Set theory has set-builder notation.It can create any set that can be defined.This allows it to create Uncountable sets.Type theories are syntactic, which limits them to a countably infinite terms.Additionally, most type theories require computation to always halt and limit themselves to recursively generable terms.As a result, most type theories do not use the Real numbers but the Computable numbers.
Many type theories are supported by LEGO and Isabelle. Isabelle also supports foundations besides type theories, such as ZFC. Mizar is an example of a proof system that only supports set theory.

Type theory was created to avoid a paradox in a mathematical foundation based on naive set theory and formal logic.Russell's paradox, which was discovered by Bertrand Russell, existed because a set could be defined using "all possible sets", which included itself.Between 1902 and 1908, Bertrand Russell proposed various "theories of type" to fix the problem. By 1908 Russell arrived at a "ramified" theory of types together with an "axiom of reducibility" both of which featured prominently in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica published between 1910 and 1913.This system avoided Russell's paradox by creating a hierarchy of types and then assigning each concrete mathematical entity to a type.Entities of a given type are built exclusively of subtypes of that type,[b] thus preventing an entity from being defined using itself. Russell's theory of typesruled out the possibility of a set being a member of itself.
Girard's paradox shows that type inhabitation is strongly related to the consistency of a type system with Curry–Howard correspondence. To be sound, such a system must have uninhabited types.
Because the type can contain computation, dependent typing is amazingly powerful.When mathematicians say "there exists a number x{\displaystyle x} such that x{\displaystyle x} is prime" or "there exists a number x{\displaystyle x} such that property P(x){\displaystyle P(x)} holds", it can be expressed as a dependent type.That is, the property is proven for the specific "x{\displaystyle x}" and that is visible in the type of the result.
nothing except the basic types, and what can be constructed from them by means of the previous clause are types.
Homotopy type theory attempts to combine type theory and category theory.It focuses on equalities, especially equalities between types.
In Julia's type system, for example, abstract types have no subtype[1]: 110  but concrete types are provided for "documentation, optimization, and dispatch".[2]
There are many details to dependent typing.They are too long and complicated for this introduction.See the article on dependent typing and the lambda cube for more information.

Dependent typing is when the type returned by a function depends on the value of its argument.For example, when a type theory has a rule that defines the type "bool", it also defines the function "if".The function "if" takes 3 arguments and "if true b c" computes to "b" and "if false b c" computes to "c".But what is the type of "if a b c"?
Proponents of type theory will also point out its connection to constructive mathematics through the BHK interpretation, its connected to logic by the Curry–Howard isomorphism, and its connections to Category theory.
In set theory, an element is not restricted to one set.The element can appear in subsets and unions with other sets.In type theory, terms (generally) belong to only one type.Where a subset would be used, type theory can use a predicate function or use a dependently-typed product type, where each element x{\displaystyle x} is paired with a proof that the subset's property holds for x{\displaystyle x}.Where a union would be used, type theory uses the sum type, which contains new canonical terms.
Set theory and logic have the law of excluded middle.That is, every theorem is true or false.When a type theory defines the concepts of "and" and "or" as types, it leads to intuitionistic logic, which does not have the law of excluded middle.However, the law can be proven for some types.
The empty type has no terms.The type is usually written "⊥{\displaystyle \bot }" or "0{\displaystyle \mathbb {0} }".
The judgements required to create the lambda term go above the line.In this case, only one judgement is required: it is that there is some term "b" of some type "B", assuming there is some term "a" of some type "A" and some other assumptions "Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }".(Note: "Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }", "a", "A", "b", and "B" are all metavariables in the rule.)The resulting judgement goes below the line.This rule's resulting judgement states that the new lambda term has type "A →{\displaystyle \to } B" under the other assumptions Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }.
When used as a foundation, certain types are interpreted as propositions (statements that can be proven) and a term of the type is a proof of that proposition.Thus, the type "Π x:nat . x+1=1+x" represents that, for any "x" of type "nat", "x+1" and "1+x" are equal.And a term of that type represents its proof.
Any static program analysis, such as the type checking algorithms in the semantic analysis phase of compiler, has a connection to type theory. A prime example is Agda, a programming language which uses UTT (Luo's Unified Theory of dependent Types) for its type system.

The Axiom of Choice does not need to be added to type theory, because in most type theories it can be derived from the rules of inference.This is because of the constructive nature of type theory, where proving that a value exists requires a method to compute the value.The Axiom of Choice is less powerful in type theory than most set theories, because type theory's functions must be computable and, being syntax-driven, the number of terms in a type must be countable.(See Axiom of choice § In constructive mathematics.)
LF is used by Twelf, often to define other type theories;
Terms can be built out of other terms using function calls.In type theory, a function call is called "function application".Function application takes a term of a given type and results in a term of another given type.Function application is written "function argument argument ...", instead of the conventional "function(argument,argument, ...)".For natural numbers, it is possible to define a function called "add" that takes two natural numbers.Thus, some more terms with their types are:
Besides ordered pairs, this type is used for the logical operator "and", because it holds an "A" and a "B".It is also used for intersection, because it holds one of both types.
An identity type requires two terms "a" and "b" of the same type and is written "a = b".So, for "x + 1" and "1 + x", the type would be "x+1 = 1+x".Canonical terms are created with the constructor "reflexivity".The call "reflexivity a" takes a term "a" and returns a canonical term of the type "a = a".
A term in logic is recursively defined as a constant symbol, variable, or a function application, where a term is applied to another term.Some constant symbols will be "0" of the natural numbers, "true" of the Booleans, and functions like "S " and "if".Thus some terms are "0", "(S 0)", "(S (S x))", and "if true 0 (S 0)".

There are similar, more powerful ways to create types.These include induction-recursion and induction-induction.There is also a way to create similar types using only lambda terms, called Scott encoding.
Homotopy type theory differs from intuitionistic type theory mostly by its handling of the equality type.In 2016 cubical type theory was proposed, which is a homotopy type theory with normalization.[16][13]

There are more types than "nat" and "bool".We have already seen the term "add", which is not a "nat", but a function that, when applied to two "nat"s, computes to a "nat".The type of "add" will be covered later.First, we need to describe "computes to" ('↠{\displaystyle \twoheadrightarrow }').
"The Constructive Hilbert Program and the Limits of Martin-Löf Type Theory"
A type theory's rules say what judgements can be made, based on the existence of other judgements.The rules are expressed using a horizontal line, with the required input judgements above the line and the resulting judgement below the line.The rule for creating a lambda term is:
The list ends with "§ inductive types", which is a powerful technique that is able to construct all the other ones in the list.The mathematical foundations used by the proof assistants "Coq" and "Lean" are based on the "Calculus for Inductive Constructions" which is the "Calculus of Constructions" (its "functional core") with inductive types.

The identity type is the third concept of equality in type theory.The first is "notational equality", which is for definitions like "2 : nat ::= (S (S 0))" that have no mathematical meaning but are useful to readers.The second is "judgmental equality", which is when two terms compute to the same term, like "x + (1 + 4)" and "x + (4 + 1)", which both compute to "x + 5".But type theory needs another form of equality, known as the "identity type" or "propositional equality".

That is, the type of the "if" term is either the type of the second or third argument, depending on the value of the first argument.In actuality, "if a B C" isn't defined using "if", but that gets into details too complicated for this introduction.
A type theory usually has a number of rules, including ones to:
But if "b" and "c" have different types, then the type of "if a b c" depends on the value of "a".We use the symbol "Π" to indicate a function that takes an argument and returns a type.Assuming we have some types "B" and C" and "a : bool", "b : B" and "c : C", then

A lambda term looks like "(λ variablename : type1 . term)" and has type "type1 →{\displaystyle \to } type2". The type "type1 →{\displaystyle \to } type2" indicates that the lambda term is a function that takes a parameter of type "type1" and computes to a term of type "type2".The term inside the lambda term must be a value of "type2", assuming the variable has type "type1".
The traditional foundation for mathematics has been set theory paired with a logic.The most common one cited is Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, known as "ZF" or, with the Axiom of choice, "ZFC".Type theories differ from this foundation in a number of ways.

There is a natural relation of types to logical propositions.If "A" is a type representing a proposition, being able to create a function of type "⊤→{\displaystyle \top \to } A" indicates that A has a proof and being able to create the function "A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }" indicates that A does not have a proof.That is, inhabitable types are proven and uninhabitable types are disproven.
The variable name is "x" and the variable has type "nat".The term "(add x x)" has type "nat", assuming "x : nat".Thus, the lambda term has type "nat →{\displaystyle \to } nat", which means if it is given a "nat" as an argument, it will compute to a "nat".Reduction (a.k.a. computation) is defined for lambda terms.When the function is applied (a.k.a. called), the argument is substituted for the parameter.

The Curry–Howard correspondence is the observed similarity between logics and programming languages.The implication in logic, "A →{\displaystyle \to } B" resembles a function from type "A" to type "B".For a variety of logics, the rules are a similar to expression in a programming language's types.The similarity goes farther, as applications of the rules resemble programs in the programming languages.Thus, the correspondence is often summarized as "proofs as programs".

It is possible to add non-constructive features to a type theory, by rule or assumption.These include operators on continuations such as call with current continuation. However, these operators tend to break desirable properties such as canonicity and parametricity.

The reason that this theory needs the identity type is because some equal terms do not compute to the same term.Assuming "x : nat", the terms "x + 1" and "1 + x" do not compute to the same term.Recall that "+" is a notation for the function "add", which is a notation for the function "R".We cannot compute on "R" until the value for "x" is specified and, until it is specified, two different calls to "R" will not compute to the same term.

The natural numbers are defined with an eliminator function "R" that uses recursion to define a function for all nats.It takes a function "P : nat →{\displaystyle \to } U" which is the type of the function to define.It also takes a term "PZ : P 0" which is the value at zero and a function "PS : P n →{\displaystyle \to } P (S n)" which says how to transform the value at "n" into the value at "n + 1".Thus, its computation rules are:
The interplay, known as categorical logic, has been a subject of active research since then; see the monograph of Jacobs (1999) for instance.
"computation" rules specify how computation is performed with the type-specific functions.

In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is the formal presentation of a specific type system,[a] and in general type theory is the academic study of type systems. Some type theories serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation of mathematics. Two influential type theories that were proposed as foundations are Alonzo Church's typed λ-calculus and Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory.Most computerized proof-writing systems use a type theory for their foundation.A common one is Thierry Coquand's Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
If a universe contains itself, it can lead to paradoxes like Girard's Paradox.
"Law of Excluded Middle" is often added to satisfy users who want classical logic, instead of intuitionistic logic.
If there are no assumptions, there will be nothing to the left of the turnstile:
A term without any variables that cannot be reduced further is a "canonical term".All the terms above reduce to "5 : nat", which is a canonical term.The canonical terms of the natural numbers are:
Most type theories do not have axioms.This is because a type theory is defined by its rules of inference.(See "Rules" above).This is a source of confusion for people familiar with Set Theory, where a theory is defined by both the rules of inference for a logic (such as first-order logic) and axioms about sets.
There are many type theories, which makes it difficult to produce a comprehensive taxonomy; this article is not an exhaustive categorization.What follows is an introduction for those unfamiliar with type theory, covering some of the major approaches.

but they all compute to the term "5 : nat".In type theory, we use the words "reduction" and "reduce" to refer to computation.So, we say "0 + 5 : nat" reduces to "5 : nat".It can be written "0 + 5 : nat ↠{\displaystyle \twoheadrightarrow } 5 : nat".The computation is mechanical, accomplished by rewriting the term's syntax.
Types were not always used in logic.There were other techniques to avoid Russell's paradox.[3] Types did gain a hold when used with one particular logic, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus.
The openendedness of Martin-Löf type theory is particularly manifest in the introduction of so-called universes. Type universes encapsulate the informal notion of reflection whose role may be explained as follows. During the course of developing a particular formalization of type theory, the type theorist may look back over the rules for types, say C, which have been introduced hitherto and perform the step of recognizing that they are valid according to Martin-Löf’s informal semantics of meaning explanation. This act of 'introspection' is an attempt to become aware of the conceptions which have governed our constructions in the past. It gives rise to a "reflection principle which roughly speaking says whatever we are used to doing with types can be done inside a universe" (Martin-Löf 1975, 83). On the formal level, this leads to an extension of the existing formalization of type theory in that the type forming capacities of C become enshrined in a type universe UC mirroring C.
A lambda term is often called an "anonymous function" because it has no name.Often, to make things easier to read, a name is given to a lambda term.This is merely a notation and has no mathematical meaning.Some authors call it "notational equality".A name might be given to the function above using the notation:
A type theory is a mathematical logic.It is a collection of rules of inference that result in judgments.Most logics have judgments asserting "The term x{\displaystyle x} is true", or "The term x{\displaystyle x} is a well-formed formula".[6]A type theory has additional judgments that define types and relate terms to types.
An example of a lambda term is this function which doubles its argument:
^ "Axioms and Computation". Theorem Proving in Lean. Retrieved 21 January 2022.
To generate a particular judgement in type theory, there must be a rule to generate it.Then, there must be rules to generate all of that rule's required inputs.And then rules for all the inputs for those rules.The applied rules form a proof tree.This is usually drawn Gentzen-style,[7] where the target judgement (root) is at the bottom, and rules that do not require any inputs (leaves) are at the top (see Natural deduction §Proofs and type theory). One example of a rule that does not require any inputs is one that states there is a term "0" of type "nat":
In the last term, parentheses were added to indicate the order of operations.Technically, most type theories require the parentheses to be present for every operation, but, in practice, they are not written and authors assume readers can use precedence and associativity to know where they are.For similar ease, it is a common notation to write "x+y{\displaystyle x+y}" instead of "add x{\displaystyle x} y{\displaystyle y}".So, the above terms might be rewritten as:
Constructive mathematics has often used intutionistic logic, as evidenced by the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation.
When some types are interpreted as propositions, there is a set of common types that can be used to connect them to make a logic out of types.However, that logic is not classical logic but intuitionistic logic.That is, it does not have the law of excluded middle nor double negation.

Terms usually belong to a single type.However, there are set theories that define "subtyping".
The rules are syntactic and work by rewriting.Thus, the metavariables like "Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }", "a", "A", etc. may actually consist of complex terms that contain many function applications, not just single symbols.
The most famous early example is Church's simply typed lambda calculus. Church's theory of types[4] helped the formal system avoid the Kleene–Rosser paradox that afflicted the original untyped lambda calculus. Church demonstrated that it could serve as a foundation of mathematics and it was referred to as a higher-order logic.
Terms may also contain variables.Variables always have a type.So, assuming "x" and "y" are variables of type "nat", the following are also valid terms:
But under this interpretation, there is no law of excluded middle.That is, there is no term of type Π A . A + (A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }).
Use of inductive types is a way to create a large variety of types.In fact, all the types described above and more can be defined using the rules of inductive types.Once the type's constructors are specified, the eliminator functions and computation is determined by structural recursion.
The judgements can be made under an assumption.For example, one might say "assuming x{\displaystyle x} is a term of type 'bool' and y{\displaystyle y} is a term of type 'nat' , (if x y y) is a term of type 'nat' ".The mathematical notation for assumptions is a comma-separated list of "term : type" that precedes the turnstile symbol '⊢{\displaystyle \vdash }'.Thus, the example statement is formally written:

Computation with the identity type is done with the eliminator function "J".The function "J" lets a term dependent on "a", "b", and a term of type "a = b" to be rewritten so that "b" is replaced by "a".While "J" is one directional, only able to substitute "b" with "a", it can be proven that the identity type is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
If a type theory has dependent typing, it has dependent pairs.In a dependent pair, the second type depends on the value of the first term.Thus, the type is written "Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } a:A . B(a)" where "B" has type "A →{\displaystyle \to } U".It is useful when showing existence of an "a" with property "B(a)".
Gregory Bateson introduced a theory of logical types into the social sciences; his notions of double bind and logical levels are based on Russell's theory of types.
The natural numbers are usually implemented in the style of Peano Arithmetic.There is a canonical term, "0 : nat" for zero.Canonical values larger than zero use the constructor function "S : nat →{\displaystyle \to } nat".Thus, "S 0" is one."S (S 0)" is two."S (S (S 0)))" is three.Etc.The decimal numbers are just notationally equal to those terms.

The list of assumptions is called the "context".It is very common to see the symbol 'Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }' used to represent some or all of the assumptions.Thus, the formal notation for the 4 different judgements is usually:
It is used to show that something is uncomputable.If for a type "A", you can create a function of type "A →⊥{\displaystyle \to \bot }", you know that "A" has no terms.An example for the type "A" might be "there exists a number x{\displaystyle x} such that both x{\displaystyle x} is even and x{\displaystyle x} is odd".(See "§Product Type" below for how the example "A" is constructed.)When a type has no terms, we say it is "uninhabited".
The sum type is used for logical or and for union.

Type theories are defined by their rules of inference.There are rules for a "§ functional core", described above, and rules that create types and terms.Below is a non-exhaustive list of common types and their associated terms.
The sum type is a "tagged union".That is, for types "A" and "B", the type "A + B" holds either a term of type "A" or a term of type "B" and it knows which one it holds.The type comes with the constructors "injectionLeft" and "injectionRight". The call "injectionLeft a" takes "a : A" and returns a canonical term of type "A + B".Similarly, injectionRight b" takes "b : B" and returns a canonical term of type "A + B".The type is defined with an eliminator function "match" such that for a type "C" and functions "f : A →{\displaystyle \to } C" and "g : B →{\displaystyle \to } C":
The most common construction takes the basic types e{\displaystyle e} and t{\displaystyle t} for individuals and truth-values, respectively, and defines the set of types recursively as follows:
The product type has terms that are ordered pairs.For types "A" and "B", the product type is written "A ×{\displaystyle \times } B".Canonical terms are created by the constructor function "pair".The terms are "pair a b", where "a" is a term of type "A" and "b" is a term of type "B".The product type is defined with eliminator functions "first" and "second" such that:
Set theory usually encodes numbers as sets.(0 is the empty set, 1 is a set containing the empty set, etc.See Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers.) Type theory can encode numbers as functions using Church encoding or more naturally as inductive types.The constructors "0" and "S" created by the inductive type closely resemble Peano's axioms.
many type theories which fall under higher-order logic are used by the HOL family of provers and PVS;
Axioms can cause problems if they introduce terms without a way to compute on those terms.That is, axioms can interfere with the normalizing property of the type theory.[11]
It is possible to include the law of excluded middle and double negation into a type theory, by rule or assumption.However, terms may not compute down to canonical terms and it will interfere with the ability to determine if two terms are judgementally equal to each other.
In type theory, proofs are mathematical objects.The type "x+1 = 1+x" cannot be used unless there is a term of the type.That term represents a proof that "x+1 = 1+x".Thus, type theory opens up proofs to be studied as mathematical objects.

The lambda term was type "nat →{\displaystyle \to } nat", which meant that given a "nat" as an argument, it will produce a term of type "nat".Since we have given it the argument "5", the above term has type "nat".Reduction works by substituting the argument "5" for the parameter "x" in the term "(add x x)", so the term computes to:
The unit type is used to show that something exists or is computable.If for a type "A", you can create a function of type "⊤→{\displaystyle \top \to } A", you know that "A" has one or more terms.When a type has at least 1 term, we say it is "inhabited".

The opposition of terms and types can also be views as one of implementation and specification. By program synthesis (the computational counterpart of) type inhabitation (see below) can be used to construct (all or parts of) programs from specification given in form of type information.[15]

Per Martin-Löf proposed his intuitionistic type theory as a foundation for constructive mathematics.Constructive mathematics requires when proving "There exists an x{\displaystyle x} with property P(x{\displaystyle x})", there must be a particular x{\displaystyle x} and a proof that it has property "P".In type theory, existence is accomplished using the dependent product type and, its proof, requires a term of that type.For the term t{\displaystyle t}, "first t{\displaystyle t}" will produce the x{\displaystyle x} and "second t{\displaystyle t}" will produce the proof of P(x{\displaystyle x}).
Computation takes place by repeated application of rules.Many type theories are strongly normalizing, which means that any order of applying the rules will always end in the same result.However, some are not.In a normalizing type theory, the one-directional computation rules are called "reduction rules", and applying the rules "reduces" the term.If a rule is not one-directional, it is called a "conversion rule".

Set theory has both rules and axioms, while type theories only have rules.Set theories are built on top of logic.Thus, ZFC is defined by both the rules of first-order logic and its own axioms.(An axiom is a logical statement accepted as true without a logical derivation.)Type theories, in general, do not have axioms and are defined by their rules of inference.

To be clear, it is possible to create the type "0 = 1", but there will not be a way to create terms of that type.Without a term of type "0 = 1", it will not be possible to use the function "J" to substitute "0" for "1" in another term.
An example of a non-constructive proof is a "proof by contradiction".The first step is assuming that x{\displaystyle x} does not exist and refuting it by contradiction.The conclusion from that step is "it is not the case that x{\displaystyle x} does not exist".The last step is, by double negation, concluding that x{\displaystyle x} exists.To be clear, constructive mathematics still allows "refute by contradiction".It can prove that "it is not the case that x{\displaystyle x} does not exist".But constructive mathematics does not allow the last step of removing the double negation to conclude that x{\displaystyle x} exists.[17]
Terms that contain variables can be reduced too.So the term "x + (1 + 4) : nat" reduces to "x + 5 : nat".(We can reduce any sub-term within a term, thanks to the Church-Rosser theorem.)

The phrase "type theory" now generally refers to a typed system based around lambda calculus.One influential system is Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory, which was proposed as a foundation for constructive mathematics. Another is Thierry Coquand's calculus of constructions, which is used as the foundation by Coq, Lean, and other "proof assistants" (computerized proof writing programs).Type theories are an area of active research, as demonstrated by homotopy type theory.
Type theory has connections to other areas of mathematics.Proponents of type theory as a foundation often mention these connections as justification for its use.
Mathematicians working in category theory already had difficulty working with the widely accepted foundation of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. This led to proposals such as Lawvere's Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (ETCS).[19] Homotopy type theory continues in this line using type theory. Researchers are exploring connections between dependent types (especially the identity type) and algebraic topology (specifically homotopy).

Type theory has a built-in notion of computation.Thus, "1+1" and "2" are different terms in type theory, but they compute to the same value.Moreover, functions are defined computationally as lambda terms.In set theory, "1+1=2" means that "1+1" is just another way to refer the value "2".Type theory's computation does require a complicated concept of equality.

Within the framework of formal logic it is impossible that both P and not-P are true, and it was attempted to justify faultless disagreements within the framework of relativism of the Truth,[2] Max Kölbel and Sven Rosenkranz present arguments to the point that genuine faultless disagreements are impossible.[1][2] However, defenses of faultless disagreement, and of alethic relativism more generally, continue to be made by critics of formal logic as it is currently constructed.[3]

A faultless disagreement is a disagreement when Party A states that P is true, while Party B states that non-P is true, and neither party is at fault. Disagreements of this kind may arise in areas of evaluative discourse, such as aesthetics, justification of beliefs or moral values, etc. A representative example is that John says Paris is more interesting than Rome, while Bob claims Rome is more interesting than Paris. Furthermore, in the case of a faultless disagreement, it is possible that if any party gives up their claim, there will be no improvement in the position of any of them.[1]

However, many languages (like English) have additional ways to express deontic modality, like modal verbs ("I shall help you.") and other verbs ("I hope to come soon."), as well as adverbials (hopefully) and other constructions.
Volitive modality (wishes, desires, etc.; boulomaic logic would apply): "If only I were rich!"
Esperanto has a mood formally called volitive which is also used for various directive uses, so it can be seen as a broader deontic mood. However, it is not used to express commissive modality. It is formed by adding -u to the verb stem, and it is used for orders and commands as well as for expressing will, desire, and purpose.[5]
Mi volas, ke vi helpu min. "I want you to help me."
Commissive modality (the speaker's commitment to do something, like a promise or threat; alethic logic or temporal logic would apply):[3] "I shall help you."
A related type of modality is dynamic modality, which indicates a subject's internal capabilities or willingness as opposed to external factors such as permission or orders given.[4]

Deontic modality (abbreviated DEO) is a linguistic modality that indicates how the world ought to be[1] according to certain norms, expectations, speaker desires, etc. In other words, a deontic expression indicates that the state of the world (where 'world' is loosely defined here in terms of the surrounding circumstances) does not meet some standard or ideal, whether that standard be social (such as laws), personal (desires), etc. The sentence containing the deontic modal generally indicates some action that would change the world so that it becomes closer to the standard or ideal.

For instance, in Heyting arithmetic, one can prove that for any proposition p that does not contain quantifiers, ∀x,y,z,…∈N:p∨¬p{\displaystyle \forall x,y,z,\ldots \in \mathbb {N} :p\vee \neg p} is a theorem (where x, y, z ... are the free variables in the proposition p). In this sense, propositions restricted to the finite are still regarded as being either true or false, as they are in classical mathematics, but this bivalence does not extend to propositions that refer to infinite collections.

"In this kind of logic, the statements an observer can make about the universe are divided into at least three groups: those that we can judge to be true, those that we can judge to be false and those whose truth we cannot decide upon at the present time" (page 28).

Errett Bishop, in his 1967 work Foundations of Constructive Analysis,[2] worked to dispel these fears by developing a great deal of traditional analysis in a constructive framework.
In the philosophy of mathematics, constructivism asserts that it is necessary to find (or "construct") a specific example of a mathematical object in order to prove that an example exists. Contrastingly, in classical mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without "finding" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a contradiction from that assumption. Such a proof by contradiction might be called non-constructive, and a constructivist might reject it. The constructive viewpoint involves a verificational interpretation of the existential quantifier, which is at odds with its classical interpretation.

With the omission of the law of the excluded middle as an axiom, the remaining logical system has an existence property that classical logic does not have: whenever ∃x∈XP(x){\displaystyle \exists _{x\in X}P(x)} is proven constructively, then in fact P(a){\displaystyle P(a)} is proven constructively for (at least) one particular a∈X{\displaystyle a\in X}, often called a witness. Thus the proof of the existence of a mathematical object is tied to the possibility of its construction.
Still, one might expect that since T is a partial function from the natural numbers onto the real numbers, that therefore the real numbers are no more than countable. And, since every natural number can be trivially represented as a real number, therefore the real numbers are no less than countable. They are, therefore exactly countable. However this reasoning is not constructive, as it still does not construct the required bijection. The classical theorem proving the existence of a bijection in such circumstances, namely the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem, is non-constructive. It has recently been shown that the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem implies the law of the excluded middle, hence there can be no constructive proof of the theorem.[4]
The status of the axiom of choice in constructive mathematics is complicated by the different approaches of different constructivist programs. One trivial meaning of "constructive", used informally by mathematicians, is "provable in ZF set theory without the axiom of choice." However, proponents of more limited forms of constructive mathematics would assert that ZF itself is not a constructive system.
Traditionally, some mathematicians have been suspicious, if not antagonistic, towards mathematical constructivism, largely because of limitations they believed it to pose for constructive analysis.These views were forcefully expressed by David Hilbert in 1928, when he wrote in Grundlagen der Mathematik, "Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists".[5]

Under this definition, a simple representation of the real number e is:
In intuitionistic theories of type theory (especially higher-type arithmetic), many forms of the axiom of choice are permitted. For example, the axiom AC11 can be paraphrased to say that for any relation R on the set of real numbers, if you have proved that for each real number x there is a real number y such that R(x,y) holds, then there is actually a function F such that R(x,F(x)) holds for all real numbers. Similar choice principles are accepted for all finite types. The motivation for accepting these seemingly nonconstructive principles is the intuitionistic understanding of the proof that "for each real number x there is a real number y such that R(x,y) holds". According to the BHK interpretation, this proof itself is essentially the function F that is desired. The choice principles that intuitionists accept do not imply the law of the excluded middle.

Errett Bishop (promoted a version of constructivism claimed to be consistent with classical mathematics)
Much constructive mathematics uses intuitionistic logic, which is essentially classical logic without the law of the excluded middle. This law states that, for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is. This is not to say that the law of the excluded middle is denied entirely; special cases of the law will be provable. It is just that the general law is not assumed as an axiom. The law of non-contradiction (which states that contradictory statements cannot both at the same time be true) is still valid.
Troelstra, Anne Sjerp; Van Dalen, Dirk (1988b). Constructivism in Mathematics: An Introduction, Volume 2. Elsevier Science. ISBN 9780444703583.
In fact, L.E.J. Brouwer, founder of the intuitionist school, viewed the law of the excluded middle as abstracted from finite experience, and then applied to the infinite without justification. For instance, Goldbach's conjecture is the assertion that every even number (greater than 2) is the sum of two prime numbers. It is possible to test for any particular even number whether or not it is the sum of two primes (for instance by exhaustive search), so any one of them is either the sum of two primes or it is not. And so far, every one thus tested has in fact been the sum of two primes.
∀n ∀i,j≥g(n)|f(i)−f(j)|≤1n{\displaystyle \forall n\ \forall i,j\geq g(n)\quad |f(i)-f(j)|\leq {1 \over n}}
But there is no known proof that all of them are so, nor any known proof that not all of them are so; nor is it even known whether either a proof or a disproof of Goldbach's conjecture must exist (the conjecture may be undecidable in traditional ZF set theory). Thus to Brouwer, we are not justified in asserting "either Goldbach's conjecture is true, or it is not." And while the conjecture may one day be solved, the argument applies to similar unsolved problems; to Brouwer, the law of the excluded middle was tantamount to assuming that every mathematical problem has a solution.
To take the algorithmic interpretation above would seem at odds with classical notions of cardinality. By enumerating algorithms, we can show classically that the computable numbers are countable. And yet Cantor's diagonal argument shows that real numbers have higher cardinality. Furthermore, the diagonal argument seems perfectly constructive. To identify the real numbers with the computable numbers would then be a contradiction.
Classical measure theory is fundamentally non-constructive, since the classical definition of Lebesgue measure does not describe any way how to compute the measure of a set or the integral of a function. In fact, if one thinks of a function just as a rule that "inputs a real number and outputs a real number" then there cannot be any algorithm to compute the integral of a function, since any algorithm would only be able to call finitely many values of the function at a time, and finitely many values are not enough to compute the integral to any nontrivial accuracy. The solution to this conundrum, carried out first in Bishop (1967), is to consider only functions that are written as the pointwise limit of continuous functions (with known modulus of continuity), with information about the rate of convergence. An advantage of constructivizing measure theory is that if one can prove that a set is constructively of full measure, then there is an algorithm for finding a point in that set (again see Bishop (1967)). For example, this approach can be used to construct a real number that is normal to every base.[citation needed]

This then opens the question as to what sort of function from a countable set to a countable set, such as f and g above, can actually be constructed. Different versions of constructivism diverge on this point. Constructions can be defined as broadly as free choice sequences, which is the intuitionistic view, or as narrowly as algorithms (or more technically, the computable functions), or even left unspecified. If, for instance, the algorithmic view is taken, then the reals as constructed here are essentially what classically would be called the computable numbers.

Even though most mathematicians do not accept the constructivist's thesis that only mathematics done based on constructive methods is sound, constructive methods are increasingly of interest on non-ideological grounds. For example, constructive proofs in analysis may ensure witness extraction, in such a way that working within the constraints of the constructive methods may make finding witnesses to theories easier than using classical methods. Applications for constructive mathematics have also been found in typed lambda calculi, topos theory and categorical logic, which are notable subjects in foundational mathematics and computer science. In algebra, for such entities as topoi and Hopf algebras, the structure supports an internal language that is a constructive theory; working within the constraints of that language is often more intuitive and flexible than working externally by such means as reasoning about the set of possible concrete algebras and their homomorphisms.

In classical real analysis, one way to define a real number is as an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.
There are many forms of constructivism.[1] These include the program of intuitionism founded by Brouwer, the finitism of Hilbert and Bernays, the constructive recursive mathematics of Shanin and Markov, and Bishop's program of constructive analysis.[2] Constructivism also includes the study of constructive set theories such as CZF and the study of topos theory.
is precisely the existence of the function computing the modulus of convergence. Thus the difference between the two definitions of real numbers can be thought of as the difference in the interpretation of the statement "for all... there exists..."
This definition corresponds to the classical definition using Cauchy sequences, except with a constructive twist: for a classical Cauchy sequence, it is required that, for any given distance, there exists (in a classical sense) a member in the sequence after which all members are closer together than that distance. In the constructive version, it is required that, for any given distance, it is possible to actually specify a point in the sequence where this happens (this required specification is often called the modulus of convergence). In fact, the standard constructive interpretation of the mathematical statement
Finitism – Philosophy of mathematics that accepts the existence only of finite mathematical objects
However, in certain axiom systems for constructive set theory, the axiom of choice does imply the law of the excluded middle (in the presence of other axioms), as shown by the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem. Some constructive set theories include weaker forms of the axiom of choice, such as the axiom of dependent choice in Myhill's set theory.
And in fact, Cantor's diagonal argument is constructive, in the sense that given a bijection between the real numbers and natural numbers, one constructs a real number that doesn't fit, and thereby proves a contradiction. We can indeed enumerate algorithms to construct a function T, about which we initially assume that it is a function from the natural numbers onto the reals. But, to each algorithm, there may or may not correspond a real number, as the algorithm may fail to satisfy the constraints, or even be non-terminating (T is a partial function), so this fails to produce the required bijection. In short, one who takes the view that real numbers are (individually) effectively computable interprets Cantor's result as showing that the real numbers (collectively) are not recursively enumerable.
Constructivism is often identified with intuitionism, although intuitionism is only one constructivist program. Intuitionism maintains that the foundations of mathematics lie in the individual mathematician's intuition, thereby making mathematics into an intrinsically subjective activity.[3] Other forms of constructivism are not based on this viewpoint of intuition, and are compatible with an objective viewpoint on mathematics.

Island mentality is the notion of isolated communities perceiving themselves as exceptional or superior to the rest of the world. This term does not directly refer to an island or other geographically confined society, but to the cultural, moral, or ideological superiority of a community or a person that lacks social exposure to the outside world. Island mentality can be characterized by narrow-mindedness, ignorance, or outright hostility towards any artifact (concept, ideology, lifestyle choice, art form, etc.) originating from outside the geographic area inhabited by the society.

The term "island mentality" is also used in some psychological research[which?] to describe individuals who dislike or have problems with relating to others, and then live as loners or "islands". This concept (in which people may feel inferior, afraid, or alone) is unrelated to the above terminology.
The two prevailing techniques for providing accounts of logical consequence involve expressing the concept in terms of proofs and via models. The study of the syntactic consequence (of a logic) is called (its) proof theory whereas the study of (its) semantic consequence is called (its) model theory.[4]

A formula A{\displaystyle A} is a syntactic consequence[5][6][7][8][9] within some formal system FS{\displaystyle {\mathcal {FS}}} of a set Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma } of formulas if there is a formal proof in FS{\displaystyle {\mathcal {FS}}} of A{\displaystyle A} from the set Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }.

The turnstile symbol ⊢{\displaystyle \vdash } was originally introduced by Frege in 1879, but its current use only dates back to Rosser and Kleene (1934--1935). [9]

Logical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation.[1] A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.[3]

This is in contrast to an argument like "Fred is Mike's brother's son. Therefore Fred is Mike's nephew." Since this argument depends on the meanings of the words "brother", "son", and "nephew", the statement "Fred is Mike's nephew" is a so-called material consequence of "Fred is Mike's brother's son", not a formal consequence. A formal consequence must be true in all cases, however this is an incomplete definition of formal consequence, since even the argument "P is Q's brother's son, therefore P is Q's nephew" is valid in all cases, but is not a formal argument.[1]
The accounts discussed above all yield monotonic consequence relations, i.e. ones such that if A{\displaystyle A} is a consequence of Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }, then A{\displaystyle A} is a consequence of any superset of Γ{\displaystyle \Gamma }. It is also possible to specify non-monotonic consequence relations to capture the idea that, e.g., 'Tweety can fly' is a logical consequence of

Syntactic accounts of logical consequence rely on schemes using inference rules. For instance, we can express the logical form of a valid argument as:
The accounts considered above are all "truth-preservational", in that they all assume that the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from true premises to an untrue conclusion. As an alternative, some have proposed "warrant-preservational" accounts, according to which the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from justifiably assertible premises to a conclusion that is not justifiably assertible. This is (roughly) the account favored by intuitionists such as Michael Dummett.
If it is known that Q{\displaystyle Q} follows logically from P{\displaystyle P}, then no information about the possible interpretations of P{\displaystyle P} or Q{\displaystyle Q} will affect that knowledge. Our knowledge that Q{\displaystyle Q} is a logical consequence of P{\displaystyle P} cannot be influenced by empirical knowledge.[1] Deductively valid arguments can be known to be so without recourse to experience, so they must be knowable a priori.[1] However, formality alone does not guarantee that logical consequence is not influenced by empirical knowledge. So the a priori property of logical consequence is considered to be independent of formality.[1]

Logicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language L{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}, either by constructing a deductive system for L{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} or by formal intended semantics for language L{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}.The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences: (2) The relation is a priori, i.e., it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense experience); and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal component.[3]
Modal accounts of logical consequence are variations on the following basic idea:
The most widely prevailing view on how best to account for logical consequence is to appeal to formality. This is to say that whether statements follow from one another logically depends on the structure or logical form of the statements without regard to the contents of that form.

This argument is formally valid, because every instance of arguments constructed using this scheme is valid.
Logical consequence (also entailment) is a fundamental concept in logic which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?[1]All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.[2]

Various dictionaries recognize a derived adjective clichéd, with the same meaning.[13][14][15][16] Cliché is sometimes used as an adjective,[14][15] although some dictionaries do not recognize it as such,[13][16] listing the word only as a noun and clichéd as the adjective.
A cliché (UK: /ˈkliːʃeɪ/ or US: /kliːˈʃeɪ/) is an element of an artistic work, saying, or idea that has become overused to the point of losing its original meaning or effect, even to the point of being weird or irritating, especially when at some earlier time it was considered meaningful or novel.[1] In phraseology, the term has taken on a more technical meaning, referring to an expression imposed by conventionalized linguistic usage.[2]
The word cliché is borrowed from French, where it is a past passive participle of clicher, 'to click', used as a noun; cliché is attested from 1825 and originated in the printing trades.[9] The term cliché was adopted as printers' jargon to refer to a stereotype, electrotype, cast plate or block print that could reproduce type or images repeatedly.[10][9] It has been suggested that the word originated from the clicking sound in "dabbed" printing (a particular form of stereotyping in which the block was impressed into a bath of molten type-metal to form a matrix). Through this onomatopoeia, cliché came to mean a ready-made, oft-repeated phrase.[11]

A cliché is often a vivid depiction of an abstraction that relies upon analogy or exaggeration for effect, often drawn from everyday experience.[7][8] Used sparingly, it may succeed, but the use of a cliché in writing, speech, or argument is generally considered a mark of inexperience or a lack of originality.

The term is often used in modern culture for an action or idea that is expected or predictable, based on a prior event. Typically pejorative, "clichés" may or may not be true.[3] Some are stereotypes, but some are simply truisms and facts.[4] Clichés often are employed for comedic effect, typically in fiction.
The term was popularized by psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton in his 1961 book, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of "Brainwashing" in China.[19] Lifton wrote, "The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis".[22] Sometimes they are used in a deliberate attempt to shut down debate, manipulate others to think a certain way, or dismiss dissent. However, some people repeat them, even to themselves, out of habit or conditioning, or as a defense mechanism to reaffirm a confirmation bias.[17][23]

Thought-terminating clichés, also known as thought-stoppers,[17] or semantic stopsigns,[18] are words or phrases that discourage critical thought and meaningful discussion about a given topic.[19] They are typically short, generic truisms that offer seemingly simple answers to complex questions or that distract attention away from other lines of thought.[19] They are often sayings that have been embedded in a culture's folk wisdom and are tempting to say because they sound true or good or like the right thing to say.[17] Some examples are: "Stop thinking so much",[20] "here we go again",[21] and "so what, what effect do my [individual] actions have?"[17]

A special case is a mathematical fallacy, an intentionally invalid mathematical proof, often with the error subtle and somehow concealed. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of spurious proofs of obvious contradictions.
The fallacy of the undistributed middle is a fallacy that is committed when the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed. It is a syllogistic fallacy. More specifically it is also a form of non sequitur.
Note that if the terms (Z and B) were swapped around in the first co-premise then it would no longer be a fallacy and would be correct.
Affirming the consequent is essentially the same as the fallacy of the undistributed middle, but using propositions rather than set membership.
The truth of the conclusion is independent of the truth of its premise – it is a 'non sequitur', since Jackson might be a mammal without being human. He might be an elephant.

Any argument that takes the following form is a non sequitur:
It is often used more generally in informal discourse to mean an argument that is problematic for any reason, and encompasses informal fallacies as well as formal fallacies—valid but unsound claims or poor non-deductive argumentation.
Although it is possible that this conclusion is true, it does not necessarily mean it must be true. The street could be wet for a variety of other reasons that this argument does not take into account. If we look at the valid form of the argument, we can see that the conclusion must be true:
The conclusion does not follow from the premise as it could be the case that A and B are both true. This fallacy stems from the stated definition of or in propositional logic to be inclusive.

Even if the premise and conclusion are both true, the conclusion is not a necessary consequence of the premise. This sort of non sequitur is also called affirming the consequent.

The presence of a formal fallacy in a deductive argument does not imply anything about the argument's premises or its conclusion (see fallacy fallacy). Both may actually be true, or even more probable as a result of the argument (e.g. appeal to authority), but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described. By extension, an argument can contain a formal fallacy even if the argument is not a deductive one; for instance an inductive argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or causality can be said to commit a formal fallacy.
*Note that this is only a logical fallacy when the word "or" is in its inclusive form.If the two possibilities in question are mutually exclusive, this is not a logical fallacy.For example,

An easy way to show the above inference as invalid is by using Venn diagrams. In logical parlance, the inference is invalid, since under at least one interpretation of the predicates it is not validity preserving.
Affirming a disjunct is a fallacy when in the following form:
Therefore, if B is the case, then A is the case.
People often have difficulty applying the rules of logic. For example, a person may say the following syllogism is valid, when in fact it is not:
In everyday speech, a non sequitur is a statement in which the final part is totally unrelated to the first part, for example:
In the strictest sense, a logical fallacy is the incorrect application of a valid logical principle or an application of a nonexistent principle:

Ideally, the best kind of formal argument is a sound, valid argument.
Fallacy of illicit process of the major or the minor term;
A logical fallacy associated with this format of argument is referred to as affirming the consequent, which would look like this:
While this may appear to be a reasonable argument, it is not valid because the first statement does not logically guarantee the second statement. The first statement says nothing like "I do not have my umbrella otherwise", which means that having my umbrella on a sunny day would render the first statement true and the second statement false.
A sound argument is a formally correct argument that also contains true premises.
While the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise:

"That creature" may well be a bird, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Certain other animals also have beaks, for example: an octopus and a squid both have beaks, some turtles and cetaceans have beaks. Errors of this type occur because people reverse a premise.[6] In this case, "All birds have beaks" is converted to "All beaked animals are birds." The reversed premise is plausible because few people are aware of any instances of beaked creatures besides birds—but this premise is not the one that was given. In this way, the deductive fallacy is formed by points that may individually appear logical, but when placed together are shown to be incorrect.
The conclusion does not follow from the premise as unlike other logical connectives, the implies operator is one-way only. "P and Q" is the same as "Q and P", but "P implies Q" is not the same as "Q implies P".
If A is the case, then B is the case.

While a logical argument is a non sequitur if, and only if, it is invalid, the term "non sequitur" typically refers to those types of invalid arguments which do not constitute formal fallacies covered by particular terms (e.g., affirming the consequent). In other words, in practice, "non sequitur" refers to an unnamed formal fallacy.
In philosophy, a formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, logical fallacy or non sequitur[1] (/ˌnɒn ˈsɛkwɪtər/; Latin for "[it] does not follow") is a pattern of reasoning rendered invalid by a flaw in its logical structure that can neatly be expressed in a standard logic system, for example propositional logic.[2] It is defined as a deductive argument that is invalid. The argument itself could have true premises, but still have a false conclusion.[3] Thus, a formal fallacy is a fallacy where deduction goes wrong, and is no longer a logical process. This may not affect the truth of the conclusion, since validity and truth are separate in formal logic.
A valid argument has a correct formal structure. A valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.
An argument could contain both an informal fallacy and a formal fallacy yet lead to a conclusion that happens to be true, for example, again affirming the consequent, now also from an untrue premise:
It may or may not be the case that "all Zs are Bs", but in either case it is irrelevant to the conclusion. What is relevant to the conclusion is whether it is true that "all Bs are Zs," which is ignored in the argument.
People in New York do not support a border fence.
Formal fallacies do not take into account the soundness of an argument, but rather its validity. Premises in formal logic are commonly represented by letters (most commonly p and q). A fallacy occurs when the structure of the argument is incorrect, despite the truth of the premises.

If a scientist makes a statement about science, it is correct.
In philosophy, the term logical fallacy properly refers to a formal fallacy—a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument, which renders the argument invalid.
Formal logic is not used to determine whether or not an argument is true. Formal arguments can either be valid or invalid. A valid argument may also be sound or unsound:
Although 1 and 2 are true statements, 3 does not follow because the argument commits the formal fallacy of affirming the consequent.
