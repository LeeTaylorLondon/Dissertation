Irrational rotations form a fundamental example in the theory of dynamical systems. According to the Denjoy theorem, every orientation-preserving C2-diffeomorphism of the circle with an irrational rotation number θ is topologically conjugate to Tθ. An irrational rotation is a measure-preserving ergodic transformation, but it is not mixing. The Poincaré map for the dynamical system associated with the Kronecker foliation on a torus with angle θ> is the irrational rotation by θ. C*-algebras associated with irrational rotations, known as irrational rotation algebras, have been extensively studied.

In the mathematical theory of dynamical systems, an irrational rotation is a map
Irrational rotations are uniquely ergodic, with the Lebesgue measure serving as the unique invariant probability measure.
The relationship between the additive and multiplicative notations is the group isomorphism

where θ is an irrational number. Under the identification of a circle with R/Z, or with the interval [0, 1] with the boundary points glued together, this map becomes a rotation of a circle by a proportion θ of a full revolution (i.e., an angle of 2πθ radians). Since θ is irrational, the rotation has infinite order in the circle group and the map Tθ has no periodic orbits.
Alternatively, we can use multiplicative notation for an irrational rotation by introducing the map
There is a strong distinction in circle rotations that depends on whether θ is rational or irrational. Rational rotations are less interesting examples of dynamical systems because if θ=ab{\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {a}{b}}} and gcd(a,b)=1{\displaystyle \gcd(a,b)=1}, then Tθb(x)=x{\displaystyle T_{\theta }^{b}(x)=x} when x∈[0,1]{\displaystyle x\in [0,1]}.It can also be shown that Tθi(x)≠x{\displaystyle T_{\theta }^{i}(x)\neq x} when 1≤i<b{\displaystyle 1\leq i<b}.

Skew Products over Rotations of the Circle: In 1969[2] William A. Veech constructed examples of minimal and not uniquely ergodic dynamical systems as follows: "Take two copies of the unit circle and mark off segment J of length 2πα in the counterclockwise direction on each one with endpoint at 0. Now take θ irrational and consider the following dynamical system. Start with a point p, say in the first circle. Rotate counterclockwise by 2πθ until the first time the orbit lands in J; then switch to the corresponding point in the second circle, rotate by 2πθ until the first time the point lands in J; switch back to the first circle and so forth. Veech showed that if θ is irrational, then there exists irrational α for which this system is minimal and the Lebesgue measure is not uniquely ergodic."[3]

If θ is irrational, then the orbit of any element of [0, 1] under the rotation Tθ is dense in [0, 1]. Therefore, irrational rotations are topologically transitive.

The circle rotation can be thought of as a subdivision of a circle into two parts, which are then exchanged with each other. A subdivision into more than two parts, which are then permuted with one-another, is called an interval exchange transformation.

Rigid rotations of compact groups effectively behave like circle rotations; the invariant measure is the Haar measure.

An irrational number cannot be fully written down in fraction or decimal form. It would have an infinite number of digits. In addition, these digits would also not repeat. The set of irrational numbers is sometimes written as R−Q{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} -\mathbb {Q} } or Q¯{\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {Q} }}}. [1][2][3]
In mathematics, an irrational number is a real number that cannot be written as a complete ratio of two integers.
In contrast to Euclid's concept of magnitudes as lines, Al-Mahani considered integers and fractions as rational magnitudes, and square roots and cube roots as irrational magnitudes. He also introduced an arithmetical approach to the concept of irrationality, as he attributes the following to irrational magnitudes:[19]
Johann Heinrich Lambert proved (1761) that π cannot be rational, and that en is irrational if n is rational (unless n = 0).[24] While Lambert's proof is often called incomplete, modern assessments support it as satisfactory, and in fact for its time it is unusually rigorous. Adrien-Marie Legendre (1794), after introducing the Bessel–Clifford function, provided a proof to show that π2 is irrational,whence it follows immediately that π is irrational also. The existence of transcendental numbers was first established by Liouville (1844, 1851).Later, Georg Cantor (1873) proved their existence by a different method, which showed that every interval in the reals contains transcendental numbers. Charles Hermite (1873) first proved e transcendental, and Ferdinand von Lindemann (1882), starting from Hermite's conclusions, showed the same for π. Lindemann's proof was much simplified by Weierstrass (1885), still further by David Hilbert (1893), and was finally made elementary by Adolf Hurwitz[citation needed] and Paul Gordan.[25]
The 17th century saw imaginary numbers become a powerful tool in the hands of Abraham de Moivre, and especially of Leonhard Euler. The completion of the theory of complex numbers in the 19th century entailed the differentiation of irrationals into algebraic and transcendental numbers, the proof of the existence of transcendental numbers, and the resurgence of the scientific study of the theory of irrationals, largely ignored since Euclid. The year 1872 saw the publication of the theories of Karl Weierstrass (by his pupil Ernst Kossak), Eduard Heine (Crelle's Journal, 74), Georg Cantor (Annalen, 5), and Richard Dedekind. Méray had taken in 1869 the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method has been completely set forth by Salvatore Pincherle in 1880,[23] and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and the endorsement by Paul Tannery (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of all rational numbers, separating them into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, Leopold Kronecker (Crelle, 101), and Charles Méray.

Continued fractions, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of Euler, and at the opening of the 19th century were brought into prominence through the writings of Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Dirichlet also added to the general theory, as have numerous contributors to the applications of the subject.

Because the algebraic numbers form a subfield of the real numbers, many irrational real numbers can be constructed by combining transcendental and algebraic numbers. For example, 3π + 2, π + √2 and e√3 are irrational (and even transcendental).

The proof above[clarification needed] for the square root of two can be generalized using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This asserts that every integer has a unique factorization into primes. Using it we can show that if a rational number is not an integer then no integral power of it can be an integer, as in lowest terms there must be a prime in the denominator that does not divide into the numerator whatever power each is raised to. Therefore, if an integer is not an exact kth power of another integer, then that first integer's kth root is irrational.
is a ratio of integers and therefore a rational number.

The number 2 raised to any positive integer power must be even (because it is divisible by 2) and the number 3 raised to any positive integer power must be odd (since none of its prime factors will be 2).Clearly, an integer cannot be both odd and even at the same time: we have a contradiction. The only assumption we made was that log2 3 is rational (and so expressible as a quotient of integers m/n with n ≠ 0). The contradiction means that this assumption must be false, i.e. log2 3 is irrational, and can never be expressed as a quotient of integers m/n with n ≠ 0.
"contained in a certain given magnitude once or many times, then this (given) magnitude corresponds to a rational number. . . . Each time when this (latter) magnitude comprises a half, or a third, or a quarter of the given magnitude (of the unit), or, compared with (the unit), comprises three, five, or three fifths, it is a rational magnitude. And, in general, each magnitude that corresponds to this magnitude (i.e. to the unit), as one number to another, is rational. If, however, a magnitude cannot be represented as a multiple, a part (1/n), or parts (m/n) of a given magnitude, it is irrational, i.e. it cannot be expressed other than by means of roots."
As a consequence of Cantor's proof that the real numbers are uncountable and the rationals countable, it follows that almost all real numbers are irrational.[3]
Squaring both sides of c = 2y yields c2 = (2y)2, or c2 = 4y2.
To show this, suppose we divide integers n by m (where m is nonzero). When long division is applied to the division of n by m, there can never be a remainder greater than or equal to m. If 0 appears as a remainder, the decimal expansion terminates. If 0 never occurs, then the algorithm can run at most m − 1 steps without using any remainder more than once. After that, a remainder must recur, and then the decimal expansion repeats.
Later, in their treatises, Indian mathematicians wrote on the arithmetic of surds including addition, subtraction, multiplication, rationalization, as well as separation and extraction of square roots.[16]

which we can assume, for the sake of establishing a contradiction, equals a ratio m/n of positive integers. Then log2⁡3=m/2n{\displaystyle \log _{2}3=m/2n} hence 2log2⁡3=2m/2n{\displaystyle 2^{\log _{2}3}=2^{m/2n}} hence 3=2m/2n{\displaystyle 3=2^{m/2n}} hence 32n=2m{\displaystyle 3^{2n}=2^{m}}, which is a contradictory pair of prime factorizations and hence violates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (unique prime factorization).

The next step was taken by Eudoxus of Cnidus, who formalized a new theory of proportion that took into account commensurable as well as incommensurable quantities. Central to his idea was the distinction between magnitude and number. A magnitude "...was not a number but stood for entities such as line segments, angles, areas, volumes, and time which could vary, as we would say, continuously. Magnitudes were opposed to numbers, which jumped from one value to another, as from 4 to 5".[9] Numbers are composed of some smallest, indivisible unit, whereas magnitudes are infinitely reducible. Because no quantitative values were assigned to magnitudes, Eudoxus was then able to account for both commensurable and incommensurable ratios by defining a ratio in terms of its magnitude, and proportion as an equality between two ratios. By taking quantitative values (numbers) out of the equation, he avoided the trap of having to express an irrational number as a number. "Eudoxus' theory enabled the Greek mathematicians to make tremendous progress in geometry by supplying the necessary logical foundation for incommensurable ratios".[10] This incommensurability is dealt with in Euclid's Elements, Book X, Proposition 9. It was not until Eudoxus developed a theory of proportion that took into account irrational as well as rational ratios that a strong mathematical foundation of irrational numbers was created.[11]
The square root of 2 was likely the first number proved irrational.[26] The golden ratio is another famous quadratic irrational number. The square roots of all natural numbers that are not perfect squares are irrational and a proof may be found in quadratic irrationals.
Although the above argument does not decide between the two cases, the Gelfond–Schneider theorem shows that √2√2 is transcendental, hence irrational. This theorem states that if a and b are both algebraic numbers, and a is not equal to 0 or 1, and b is not a rational number, then any value of ab is a transcendental number (there can be more than one value if complex number exponentiation is used).

Since y is an integer, and 2y2 = b2, b2 is divisible by 2, and therefore even.
Under the usual (Euclidean) distance function d(x,y)=|x−y|{\displaystyle d(x,y)=\vert x-y\vert }, the real numbers are a metric space and hence also a topological space.Restricting the Euclidean distance function gives the irrationals the structure of a metric space.Since the subspace of irrationals is not closed,the induced metric is not complete.Being a G-delta set—i.e., a countable intersection of open subsets—in a complete metric space, the space of irrationals is completely metrizable: that is, there is a metric on the irrationals inducing the same topology as the restriction of the Euclidean metric, but with respect to which the irrationals are complete.One can see this without knowing the aforementioned fact about G-delta sets: the continued fraction expansion of an irrational number defines a homeomorphism from the space of irrationals to the space of all sequences of positive integers, which is easily seen to be completely metrizable.
Substituting 4y2 for c2 in the first equation (c2 = 2b2) gives us 4y2= 2b2.

Like all real numbers, irrational numbers can be expressed in positional notation, notably as a decimal number. In the case of irrational numbers, the decimal expansion does not terminate, nor end with a repeating sequence. For example, the decimal representation of π starts with 3.14159, but no finite number of digits can represent π exactly, nor does it repeat. Conversely, a decimal expansion that terminates or repeats must be a rational number. These are provable properties of rational numbers and positional number systems, and are not used as definitions in mathematics.

The decimal expansion of an irrational number never repeats or terminates (the latter being equivalent to repeating zeroes), unlike any rational number. The same is true for binary, octal or hexadecimal expansions, and in general for expansions in every positional notation with natural bases.
Many of these concepts were eventually accepted by European mathematicians sometime after the Latin translations of the 12th century. Al-Hassār, a Moroccan mathematician from Fez specializing in Islamic inheritance jurisprudence during the 12th century, first mentions the use of a fractional bar, where numerators and denominators are separated by a horizontal bar. In his discussion he writes, "..., for example, if you are told to write three-fifths and a third of a fifth, write thus, 3153{\displaystyle {\frac {3\quad 1}{5\quad 3}}}."[21] This same fractional notation appears soon after in the work of Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century.[22]

The Egyptian mathematician Abū Kāmil Shujā ibn Aslam (c. 850 – 930) was the first to accept irrational numbers as solutions to quadratic equations or as coefficients in an equation, often in the form of square roots, cube roots and fourth roots.[20] In the 10th century, the Iraqi mathematician Al-Hashimi provided general proofs (rather than geometric demonstrations) for irrational numbers, as he considered multiplication, division, and other arithmetical functions.[19] Iranian mathematician, Abū Ja'far al-Khāzin (900–971) provides a definition of rational and irrational magnitudes, stating that if a definite quantity is:[19]

The first proof of the existence of irrational numbers is usually attributed to a Pythagorean (possibly Hippasus of Metapontum),[4] who probably discovered them while identifying sides of the pentagram.[5]The then-current Pythagorean method would have claimed that there must be some sufficiently small, indivisible unit that could fit evenly into one of these lengths as well as the other. Hippasus, in the 5th century BC, however, was able to deduce that there was in fact no common unit of measure, and that the assertion of such an existence was in fact a contradiction. He did this by demonstrating that if the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle was indeed commensurable with a leg, then one of those lengths measured in that unit of measure must be both odd and even, which is impossible. His reasoning is as follows:

Furthermore, the set of all irrationals is a disconnected metrizable space. In fact, the irrationals equipped with the subspace topology have a basis of clopen sets so the space is zero-dimensional.
Conversely, suppose we are faced with a repeating decimal, we can prove that it is a fraction of two integers. For example, consider:

A stronger result is the following:[29] Every rational number in the interval ((1/e)1/e,∞){\displaystyle ((1/e)^{1/e},\infty )} can be written either as aa for some irrational number a or as nn for some natural number n. Similarly,[29] every positive rational number can be written either as aaa{\displaystyle a^{a^{a}}} for some irrational number a or as nnn{\displaystyle n^{n^{n}}} for some natural number n.
Greek mathematicians termed this ratio of incommensurable magnitudes alogos, or inexpressible. Hippasus, however, was not lauded for his efforts: according to one legend, he made his discovery while out at sea, and was subsequently thrown overboard by his fellow Pythagoreans "... for having produced an element in the universe which denied the... doctrine that all phenomena in the universe can be reduced to whole numbers and their ratios."[7] Another legend states that Hippasus was merely exiled for this revelation. Whatever the consequence to Hippasus himself, his discovery posed a very serious problem to Pythagorean mathematics, since it shattered the assumption that number and geometry were inseparable–a foundation of their theory.
The result of the two multiplications gives two different expressions with exactly the same "decimal portion", that is, the tail end of 10,000A matches the tail end of 10A exactly. Here, both 10,000A and 10A have .162162162... after the decimal point.

Perhaps the numbers most easy to prove irrational are certain logarithms. Here is a proof by contradiction that log2 3 is irrational (log2 3 ≈ 1.58 > 0).
It is suggested that the concept of irrationality was implicitly accepted by Indian mathematicians since the 7th century BC, when Manava (c. 750 – 690 BC) believed that the square roots of numbers such as 2 and 61 could not be exactly determined.[14] Historian Carl Benjamin Boyer, however, writes that "such claims are not well substantiated and unlikely to be true".[15]
Since c2 = 2b2, c2 is divisible by 2, and therefore even.
Now we multiply this equation by 10r where r is the length of the repetend. This has the effect of moving the decimal point to be in front of the "next" repetend. In our example, multiply by 103:

Here the repetend is 162 and the length of the repetend is 3. First, we multiply by an appropriate power of 10 to move the decimal point to the right so that it is just in front of a repetend. In this example we would multiply by 10 to obtain:

As a result of the distinction between number and magnitude, geometry became the only method that could take into account incommensurable ratios. Because previous numerical foundations were still incompatible with the concept of incommensurability, Greek focus shifted away from those numerical conceptions such as algebra and focused almost exclusively on geometry. In fact, in many cases algebraic conceptions were reformulated into geometric terms. This may account for why we still conceive of x2 and x3 as x squared and x cubed instead of x to the second power and x to the third power. Also crucial to Zeno’s work with incommensurable magnitudes was the fundamental focus on deductive reasoning that resulted from the foundational shattering of earlier Greek mathematics. The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory. Out of this necessity, Eudoxus developed his method of exhaustion, a kind of reductio ad absurdum that "...established the deductive organization on the basis of explicit axioms..." as well as "...reinforced the earlier decision to rely on deductive reasoning for proof".[12] This method of exhaustion is the first step in the creation of calculus.

It is also suggested that Aryabhata (5th century AD), in calculating a value of pi to 5 significant figures, used the word āsanna (approaching), to mean that not only is this an approximation but that the value is incommensurable (or irrational).

Assume a, b, and c are in the smallest possible terms(i.e. they have no common factors).
By the Pythagorean theorem: c2 = a2+b2 = b2+b2 = 2b2. (Since the triangle is isosceles, a = b).
Since c is even, dividing c by 2 yields an integer. Let y be this integer (c = 2y).

Therefore, when we subtract the 10A equation from the 10,000A equation, the tail end of 10A cancels out the tail end of 10,000A leaving us with:
Consider √2√2; if this is rational, then take a = b = √2.Otherwise, take a to be the irrational number √2√2 and b = √2.Then ab = (√2√2)√2 = √2√2·√2 = √22 = 2, which is rational.
In constructive mathematics, excluded middle is not valid, so it is not true that every real number is rational or irrational. Thus, the notion of an irrational number bifurcates into multiple distinct notions. One could take the traditional definition of an irrational number as a real number that is not rational.[31] However, there is a second definition of an irrational number used in constructive mathematics, that a real number r{\displaystyle r} is an irrational number if it is apart from every rational number, or equivalently, if the distance |r−q|{\displaystyle \vert r-q\vert } between r{\displaystyle r} and every rational number q{\displaystyle q} is positive. This definition is stronger than the traditional definition of an irrational number. This second definition is used in Errett Bishop's proof that the square root of 2 is irrational.[32]

where the coefficients ai{\displaystyle a_{i}} are integers and an≠0{\displaystyle a_{n}\neq 0}. Any rational root of this polynomial equation must be of the form r /s, where r is a divisor of a0 and s is a divisor of an. If a real root x0{\displaystyle x_{0}} of a polynomial p{\displaystyle p} is not among these finitely many possibilities, it must be an irrational algebraic number. An exemplary proof for the existence of such algebraic irrationals is by showing that x0  = (21/2 + 1)1/3 is an irrational root of a polynomial with integer coefficients: it satisfies (x3 − 1)2 = 2 and hence x6 − 2x3 − 1 = 0, and this latter polynomial has no rational roots (the only candidates to check are ±1, and x0, being greater than 1, is neither of these), so x0 is an irrational algebraic number.

Almost all irrational numbers are transcendental and all real transcendental numbers are irrational (there are also complex transcendental numbers): the article on transcendental numbers lists several examples.

In mathematics, the irrational numbers (from in- prefix assimilated to ir- (negative prefix, privative) + rational) are all the real numbers that are not rational numbers. That is, irrational numbers cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. When the ratio of lengths of two line segments is an irrational number, the line segments are also described as being incommensurable, meaning that they share no "measure" in common, that is, there is no length ("the measure"), no matter how short, that could be used to express the lengths of both of the two given segments as integer multiples of itself.
"It will be a rational (magnitude) when we, for instance, say 10, 12, 3%, 6%, etc., because its value is pronounced and expressed quantitatively. What is not rational is irrational and it is impossible to pronounce and represent its value quantitatively. For example: the roots of numbers such as 10, 15, 20 which are not squares, the sides of numbers which are not cubes etc."
The discovery of incommensurable ratios was indicative of another problem facing the Greeks: the relation of the discrete to the continuous. This was brought into light by Zeno of Elea, who questioned the conception that quantities are discrete and composed of a finite number of units of a given size. Past Greek conceptions dictated that they necessarily must be, for "whole numbers represent discrete objects, and a commensurable ratio represents a relation between two collections of discrete objects",[8] but Zeno found that in fact "[quantities] in general are not discrete collections of units; this is why ratios of incommensurable [quantities] appear... .[Q]uantities are, in other words, continuous".[8] What this means is that, contrary to the popular conception of the time, there cannot be an indivisible, smallest unit of measure for any quantity. That in fact, these divisions of quantity must necessarily be infinite. For example, consider a line segment: this segment can be split in half, that half split in half, the half of the half in half, and so on. This process can continue infinitely, for there is always another half to be split. The more times the segment is halved, the closer the unit of measure comes to zero, but it never reaches exactly zero. This is just what Zeno sought to prove. He sought to prove this by formulating four paradoxes, which demonstrated the contradictions inherent in the mathematical thought of the time. While Zeno's paradoxes accurately demonstrated the deficiencies of current mathematical conceptions, they were not regarded as proof of the alternative. In the minds of the Greeks, disproving the validity of one view did not necessarily prove the validity of another, and therefore further investigation had to occur.
Irrational numbers can also be expressed as non-terminating continued fractions and many other ways.

We have just shown that both b and c must be even. Hence they have a common factor of 2.However this contradicts the assumption that they have no common factors.This contradiction proves that c and b cannot both be integers, and thus the existence of a number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.[6]
During the 14th to 16th centuries, Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics discovered the infinite series for several irrational numbers such as π and certain irrational values of trigonometric functions.

This linear operator is called the transfer operator or the Ruelle–Frobenius–Perron operator.The largest eigenvalue is the Frobenius–Perron eigenvalue, and in this case, it is 1.The associated eigenvector is the invariant measure: in this case, it is the Bernoulli measure. Again, LT(ρ)=ρ{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{T}(\rho )=\rho } when ρ(x)=1.{\displaystyle \rho (x)=1.}
The dyadic transformation provides an example of how a simple 1-dimensional map can give rise to chaos. This map readily generalizes to several others. An important one is the beta transformation, defined as Tβ(x)=βxmod1{\displaystyle T_{\beta }(x)=\beta x{\bmod {1}}}. This map has been extensively studied by many authors. It was introduced by Alfréd Rényi in 1957, and an invariant measure for it was given by Alexander Gelfond in 1959 and again independently by Bill Parry in 1960.[4][5][6]
We can implement the renormalization group by integrating out every other spin. In so doing, one finds that Z{\displaystyle Z} can also be equated with the partition function for a smaller system with but N{\displaystyle N} spins,
So, for example, (0,∗,⋯){\displaystyle (0,*,\cdots )} maps to the interval [0,1/2]{\displaystyle [0,1/2]} and (1,∗,…){\displaystyle (1,*,\dots )} maps to the interval [1/2,1]{\displaystyle [1/2,1]} and both of these intervals have a measure of 1/2. Similarly, (∗,0,∗,…){\displaystyle (*,0,*,\dots )} maps to the interval [0,1/4]∪[1/2,3/4]{\displaystyle [0,1/4]\cup [1/2,3/4]} which still has the measure 1/2. That is, the embedding above preserves the measure.
Tacking on the initial non-repeating sequence, one clearly has a rational number. In fact, every rational number can be expressed in this way: an initial "random" sequence, followed by a cycling repeat.That is, the periodic orbits of the map are in one-to-one correspondence with the rationals.
Viewed as a linear operator, the most obvious and pressing question is: what is its spectrum? One eigenvalue is obvious: if ρ(x)=1{\displaystyle \rho (x)=1} for all x{\displaystyle x} then one obviously has LTρ=ρ{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{T}\rho =\rho } so the uniform density is invariant under the transformation. This is in fact the largest eigenvalue of the operator LT{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{T}}, it is the Frobenius–Perron eigenvalue. The uniform density is, in fact, nothing other than the invariant measure of the dyadic transformation.
There is also a semi-conjugacy between the dyadic transformation (here named angle doubling map) and the quadratic polynomial. Here, the map doubles angles measured in turns. That is, the map is given by
Expressed as bit strings, the periodic orbits of the map can be seen to the rationals. That is, after an initial "chaotic" sequence of b0,b1,b2,…,bk−1{\displaystyle b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\dots ,b_{k-1}}, a periodic orbit settles down into a repeating string bk,bk+1,bk+2,…,bk+m−1{\displaystyle b_{k},b_{k+1},b_{k+2},\dots ,b_{k+m-1}} of length m{\displaystyle m}.It is not hard to see that such repeating sequences correspond to rational numbers.

Keep in mind, however, that the rationals are a set of measure zero in the reals. Almost all orbits are not periodic! The aperiodic orbits correspond to the irrational numbers. This property also holds true in a more general setting. An open question is to what degree the behavior of the periodic orbits constrain the behavior of the system as a whole.Phenomena such as Arnold diffusion suggest that the general answer is "not very much".

A vast amount of simplification results if one instead works with the Cantor space Ω={0,1}N{\displaystyle \Omega =\{0,1\}^{\mathbb {N} }}, and functions ρ:Ω→R.{\displaystyle \rho :\Omega \to \mathbb {R} .} Some caution is advised, as the map T(x)=2xmod1{\displaystyle T(x)=2x{\bmod {1}}} is defined on the unit interval of the real number line, assuming the natural topology on the reals.By contrast, the map T(b0,b1,b2,…)=(b1,b2,…){\displaystyle T(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\dots )=(b_{1},b_{2},\dots )} is defined on the Cantor space Ω={0,1}N{\displaystyle \Omega =\{0,1\}^{\mathbb {N} }}, which by convention is given a very different topology, the product topology. There is a potential clash of topologies; some care must be taken. However, as presented above, there is a homomorphism from the Cantor set into the reals; fortunately, it maps open sets into open sets, and thus preserves notions of continuity.
where the ∗{\displaystyle *} are arbitrary bit values (not necessarily all the same), and the bk,bm,…{\displaystyle b_{k},b_{m},\dots } are a finite number of specific bit-values scattered in the infinite bit-string. These are the open sets of the topology. The canonical measure on this space is the Bernoulli measure for the fair coin-toss. If there is just one bit specified in the string of arbitrary positions, the measure is 1/2. If there are two bits specified, the measure is 1/4, and so on. One can get fancier: given a real number 0<p<1{\displaystyle 0<p<1} one can define a measure

This phenomenon is note-worthy, because something similar happens in many chaotic systems. For example, geodesics on compact manifolds can have periodic orbits that behave in this way.

To work with the Cantor set Ω={0,1}N{\displaystyle \Omega =\{0,1\}^{\mathbb {N} }}, one must provide a topology for it; by convention, this is the product topology.

Equivalently, the dyadic transformation can also be defined as the iterated function map of the piecewise linear function
To obtain the spectrum of LT{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{T}}, one must provide a suitable set of basis functions for the space F.{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}.} One such choice is to restrict F{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} to the set of all polynomials. In this case, the operator has a discrete spectrum, and the eigenfunctions are (curiously) the Bernoulli polynomials![8] (This coincidence of naming was presumably not known to Bernoulli.)

That is, f1(x)=S−1(T(S(x))).{\displaystyle f_{1}(x)=S^{-1}(T(S(x))).} This is stable under iteration, as
The denominator in the above is the Jacobian determinant of the transformation, here it is just the derivative of T{\displaystyle T} and so T′(y)=2{\displaystyle T^{\prime }(y)=2}. Also, there are obviously only two points in the preimage of T−1(x){\displaystyle T^{-1}(x)}, these are y=x/2{\displaystyle y=x/2} and y=(x+1)/2.{\displaystyle y=(x+1)/2.} Putting it all together, one gets

Because of the simple nature of the dynamics when the iterates are viewed in binary notation, it is easy to categorize the dynamics based on the initial condition:
Suppose now that we allow βg{\displaystyle \beta g} to be complex and that Im⁡[2βg]=π2+πn{\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} [2\beta g]={\frac {\pi }{2}}+\pi n} for some n∈Z{\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {Z} }. In that case we can introduce a parameter t∈[0,1){\displaystyle t\in [0,1)} related to βg{\displaystyle \beta g} via the equation
The map can be obtained as a homomorphism on the Bernoulli process. Let Ω={H,T}N{\displaystyle \Omega =\{H,T\}^{\mathbb {N} }} be the set of all semi-infinite strings of the letters H{\displaystyle H} and T{\displaystyle T}. These can be understood to be the flips of a coin, coming up heads or tails. Equivalently, one can write Ω={0,1}N{\displaystyle \Omega =\{0,1\}^{\mathbb {N} }} the space of all (semi-)infinite strings of binary bits. The word "infinite" is qualified with "semi-", as one can also define a different space {0,1}Z{\displaystyle \{0,1\}^{\mathbb {Z} }} consisting of all doubly-infinite (double-ended) strings; this will lead to the Baker's map. The qualification "semi-" is dropped below.
which has reached a cycle of period 2.Within any subinterval of [0, 1), no matter how small, there are therefore an infinite number of points whose orbits are eventually periodic, and an infinite number of points whose orbits are never periodic. This sensitive dependence on initial conditions is a characteristic of chaotic maps.
The name bit shift map arises because, if the value of an iterate is written in binary notation, the next iterate is obtained by shifting the binary point one bit to the right, and if the bit to the left of the new binary point is a "one", replacing it with a zero.

Equivalent to the concept of information loss is the concept of information gain.In practice some real-world process may generate a sequence of values (xn) over time, but we may only be able to observe these values in truncated form. Suppose for example that x0 = 0.1001101, but we only observe the truncated value 0.1001.Our prediction for x1 is 0.001. If we wait until the real-world process has generated the true x1 value 0.001101, we will be able to observe the truncated value 0.0011, which is more accurate than our predicted value 0.001. So we have received an information gain of one bit.
The periodic and non-periodic orbits can be more easily understood not by working with the map T(x)=2xmod1{\displaystyle T(x)=2x{\bmod {1}}} directly, but rather with the bit shift map T(b0,b1,b2,…)=(b1,b2,…){\displaystyle T(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\dots )=(b_{1},b_{2},\dots )} defined on the Cantor space Ω={0,1}N{\displaystyle \Omega =\{0,1\}^{\mathbb {N} }}.
Instead of looking at the orbits of individual points under the action of the map, it is equally worthwhile to explore how the map affects densities on the unit interval. That is, imagine sprinkling some dust on the unit interval; it is denser in some places than in others.What happens to this density as one iterates?
The resulting x{\displaystyle x} is a real number in the unit interval 0≤x≤1.{\displaystyle 0\leq x\leq 1.} The shift T{\displaystyle T} induces a homomorphism, also called T{\displaystyle T}, on the unit interval. Since T(b0,b1,b2,…)=(b1,b2,…),{\displaystyle T(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\dots )=(b_{1},b_{2},\dots ),} one can easily see that T(x)=2xmod1.{\displaystyle T(x)=2x{\bmod {1}}.}For the doubly-infinite sequence of bits Ω=2Z,{\displaystyle \Omega =2^{\mathbb {Z} },} the induced homomorphism is the Baker's map.
Z=∑{σi=±1,i∈ZN}∏i∈ZNR[C]e−R[βg]σiσi+1,{\displaystyle Z=\sum _{\{\sigma _{i}=\pm 1,\,i\in \mathbb {Z} _{N}\}}\prod _{i\in \mathbb {Z} _{N}}{\mathcal {R}}[C]e^{-{\mathcal {R}}[\beta g]\sigma _{i}\sigma _{i+1}},}
which preserves the measure μp.{\displaystyle \mu _{p}.} That is, it maps such that the measure on the unit interval is again the Lebesgue measure.
Another basis is provided by the Haar basis, and the functions spanning the space are the Haar wavelets. In this case, one finds a continuous spectrum, consisting of the unit disk on the complex plane. Given z∈C{\displaystyle z\in \mathbb {C} } in the unit disk, so that |z|<1{\displaystyle |z|<1}, the functions

One hallmark of chaotic dynamics is the loss of information as simulation occurs. If we start with information on the first s bits of the initial iterate, then after m simulated iterations (m < s) we only have s − m bits of information remaining. Thus we lose information at the exponential rate of one bit per iteration. After s iterations, our simulation has reached the fixed point zero, regardless of the true iterate values; thus we have suffered a complete loss of information. This illustrates sensitive dependence on initial conditions—the mapping from the truncated initial condition has deviated exponentially from the mapping from the true initial condition. And since our simulation has reached a fixed point, for almost all initial conditions it will not describe the dynamics in the qualitatively correct way as chaotic.

To explore the spectrum of LT{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{T}} in greater detail, one must first limit oneself to a suitable space of functions (on the unit interval) to work with. This might be the space of Lebesgue measurable functions, or perhaps the space of square integrable functions, or perhaps even just polynomials. Working with any of these spaces is surprisingly difficult, although a spectrum can be obtained.[7]

If the initial condition is irrational (as almost all points in the unit interval are), then the dynamics are non-periodic—this follows directly from the definition of an irrational number as one with a non-repeating binary expansion. This is the chaotic case.
The fractal eigenfunctions show an explicit symmetry under the fractal groupoid of the modular group; this is developed in greater detail in the article on the Takagi function (the blancmange curve). Perhaps not a surprise; the Cantor set has exactly the same set of symmetries (as do the continued fractions.) This then leads elegantly into the theory of elliptic equations and modular forms.

If x0 is rational the image of x0 contains a finite number of distinct values within [0, 1) and the forward orbit of x0 is eventually periodic, with period equal to the period of the binary expansion of x0.Specifically, if the initial condition is a rational number with a finite binary expansion of k bits, then after k iterations the iterates reach the fixed point 0;if the initial condition is a rational number with a k-bit transient (k ≥ 0) followed by a q-bit sequence (q > 1) that repeats itself infinitely, then after k iterations the iterates reach a cycle of length q.

In mathematics, a group is a set and an operation that combines any two elements of the set to produce a third element of the set, in such a way that the operation is associative, an identity element exists and every element has an inverse. These three axioms hold for number systems and many other mathematical structures. For example, the integers together with the addition operation form a group. The concept of a group and the axioms that define it were elaborated for handling, in a unified way, essential structural properties of very different mathematical entities such as numbers, geometric shapes and polynomial roots. Because the concept of groups is ubiquitous in numerous areas both within and outside mathematics, some authors consider it as a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.[1][2]
Geometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program.[15] After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.[16]

A cyclic group is a group all of whose elements are powers of a particular element a{\displaystyle a}.[46] In multiplicative notation, the elements of the group are
A group can be thought of as a small category with one object x in which every morphism is an isomorphism: given such a category, the set Hom⁡(x,x){\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (x,x)} is a group; conversely, given a group G, one can build a small category with one object x in whichHom⁡(x,x)≃G{\displaystyle \operatorname {Hom} (x,x)\simeq G}.More generally, a groupoid is any small category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.In a groupoid, the set of all morphisms in the category is usually not a group, because the composition is only partially defined: fg is defined only when the source of f matches the target of g.Groupoids arise in topology (for instance, the fundamental groupoid) and in the theory of stacks.
However, a group is not determined by its lattice of subgroups. See Suzuki 1951.

A group is called finite if it has a finite number of elements. The number of elements is called the order of the group.[71] An important class is the symmetric groups SN{\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{N}}, the groups of permutations of N{\displaystyle N} objects. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters S3{\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{3}} is the group of all possible reorderings of the objects. The three letters ABC can be reordered into ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA, forming in total 6 (factorial of 3) elements. The group operation is composition of these reorderings, and the identity element is the reordering operation that leaves the order unchanged. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group SN{\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{N}} for a suitable integer N{\displaystyle N}, according to Cayley's theorem. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, S3{\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{3}} can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.
"The status of the classification of the finite simple groups"
For example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a monoid. The natural numbers N{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } (including zero) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication (Z∖{0},⋅){\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} \smallsetminus \{0\},\cdot )}. Adjoining inverses of all elements of the monoid (Z∖{0},⋅){\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} \smallsetminus \{0\},\cdot )} produces a group (Q∖{0},⋅){\displaystyle (\mathbb {Q} \smallsetminus \{0\},\cdot )}, and likewise adjoining inverses to any (abelian) monoid M produces a group known as the Grothendieck group of M.
^ For example, a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is necessarily cyclic. See Lang 2002, Theorem IV.1.9. The notions of torsion of a module and simple algebras are other instances of this principle.
Binary operation: Composition is a binary operation. That is, a∘b{\displaystyle a\circ b} is a symmetry for any two symmetries a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}. For example,

A group and its underlying set are thus two different mathematical objects. To avoid cumbersome notation, it is common to abuse notation by using the same symbol to denote both. This reflects also an informal way of thinking: that the group is the same as the set except that it has been enriched by additional structure provided by the operation.
In geometry groups arise naturally in the study of symmetries and geometric transformations: The symmetries of an object form a group, called the symmetry group of the object, and the transformations of a given type form a general group. Lie groups appear insymmetry groups in geometry, and also in the Standard Model of particle physics. The Poincaré group is a Lie group consisting of the symmetries of spacetime in special relativity. Point groups describe symmetry in molecular chemistry.
Individual axioms may be "weakened" to assert only the existence of a left identity and left inverses. From these one-sided axioms, one can prove that the left identity is also a right identity and a left inverse is also a right inverse for the same element. Since they define exactly the same structures as groups, collectively the axioms are no weaker.[27]

The identity homomorphism of a group G{\displaystyle G} is the homomorphism ιG:G→G{\displaystyle \iota _{G}\colon G\to G} that maps each element of G{\displaystyle G} to itself. An inverse homomorphism of a homomorphism φ:G→H{\displaystyle \varphi \colon G\to H} is a homomorphism ψ:H→G{\displaystyle \psi \colon H\to G} such that ψ∘φ=ιG{\displaystyle \psi \circ \varphi =\iota _{G}} and φ∘ψ=ιH{\displaystyle \varphi \circ \psi =\iota _{H}}, that is, such that ψ(φ(g))=g{\displaystyle \psi {\bigl (}\varphi (g){\bigr )}=g} for all g{\displaystyle g} in G{\displaystyle G} and such that φ(ψ(h))=h{\displaystyle \varphi {\bigl (}\psi (h){\bigr )}=h} for all h{\displaystyle h} in H{\displaystyle H}. An isomorphism is a homomorphism that has an inverse homomorphism; equivalently, it is a bijective homomorphism. Groups G{\displaystyle G} and H{\displaystyle H} are called isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism φ:G→H{\displaystyle \varphi \colon G\to H}. In this case, H{\displaystyle H} can be obtained from G{\displaystyle G} simply by renaming its elements according to the function φ{\displaystyle \varphi }; then any statement true for G{\displaystyle G} is true for H{\displaystyle H}, provided that any specific elements mentioned in the statement are also renamed.
This was crucial to the classification of finite simple groups, for example. See Aschbacher 2004.

The group table lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270° clockwise (r3{\displaystyle r_{3}}) and then reflecting horizontally (fh{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {h} }}) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (fd{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {d} }}). Using the above symbols, highlighted in blue in the group table:
It would be natural to require also that φ{\displaystyle \varphi } respect identities, φ(1G)=1H{\displaystyle \varphi (1_{G})=1_{H}}, and inverses, φ(a−1)=φ(a)−1{\displaystyle \varphi (a^{-1})=\varphi (a)^{-1}} for all a{\displaystyle a} in G{\displaystyle G}. However, these additional requirements need not be included in the definition of homomorphisms, because they are already implied by the requirement of respecting the group operation.[30]

In the example of symmetries of a square, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup R={id,r1,r2,r3}{\displaystyle R=\{\mathrm {id} ,r_{1},r_{2},r_{3}\}}, highlighted in red in the group table of the example: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations270° for 90°, 180° for 180°, and 90° for 270°. The subgroup test provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a nonempty subset H of a group G to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that g−1⋅h∈H{\displaystyle g^{-1}\cdot h\in H} for all elements g{\displaystyle g} and h{\displaystyle h} in H{\displaystyle H}. Knowing a group's subgroups is important in understanding the group as a whole.[e]

Two figures in the plane are congruent if one can be changed into the other using a combination of rotations, reflections, and translations. Any figure is congruent to itself. However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called symmetries. A square has eight symmetries. These are:
(fd∘fv)∘r2=fd∘(fv∘r2){\displaystyle (f_{\mathrm {d} }\circ f_{\mathrm {v} })\circ r_{2}=f_{\mathrm {d} }\circ (f_{\mathrm {v} }\circ r_{2})}
In many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in the symmetry group of a square, once any reflection is performed, rotations alone cannot return the square to its original position, so one can think of the reflected positions of the square as all being equivalent to each other, and as inequivalent to the unreflected positions; the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup H{\displaystyle H} determines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of H{\displaystyle H} by an arbitrary group element g{\displaystyle g}. In symbolic terms, the left and right cosets of H{\displaystyle H}, containing an element g{\displaystyle g}, are
Some topological spaces may be endowed with a group law. In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be continuous functions; informally, g⋅h{\displaystyle g\cdot h} and g−1{\displaystyle g^{-1}} must not vary wildly if g{\displaystyle g} and h{\displaystyle h} vary only a little. Such groups are called topological groups, and they are the group objects in the category of topological spaces.[76] The most basic examples are the group of real numbers under addition and the group of nonzero real numbers under multiplication. Similar examples can be formed from any other topological field, such as the field of complex numbers or the field of p-adic numbers. These examples are locally compact, so they have Haar measures and can be studied via harmonic analysis. Other locally compact topological groups include the group of points of an algebraic group over a local field or adele ring; these are basic to number theory[77] Galois groups of infinite algebraic field extensions are equipped with the Krull topology, which plays a role in infinite Galois theory.[78] A generalization used in algebraic geometry is the étale fundamental group.[79]

^ The transition from the integers to the rationals by including fractions is generalized by the field of fractions.
The additive group of the field R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is the group whose underlying set is R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and whose operation is addition. The multiplicative group of the field R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is the group R×{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\times }} whose underlying set is the set of nonzero real numbers R∖{0}{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \smallsetminus \{0\}} and whose operation is multiplication.
In D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}}, the group of symmetries of a square, with its subgroup R{\displaystyle R} of rotations, the left cosets gR{\displaystyle gR} are either equal to R{\displaystyle R}, if g{\displaystyle g} is an element of R{\displaystyle R} itself, or otherwise equal to U=fcR={fc,fd,fv,fh}{\displaystyle U=f_{\mathrm {c} }R=\{f_{\mathrm {c} },f_{\mathrm {d} },f_{\mathrm {v} },f_{\mathrm {h} }\}} (highlighted in green in the group table of D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}}). The subgroup R{\displaystyle R} is normal, because fcR=U=Rfc{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {c} }R=U=Rf_{\mathrm {c} }} and similarly for the other elements of the group. (In fact, in the case of D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}}, the cosets generated by reflections are all equal: fhR=fvR=fdR=fcR{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {h} }R=f_{\mathrm {v} }R=f_{\mathrm {d} }R=f_{\mathrm {c} }R}.)

The group of integers Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } under addition, denoted (Z,+){\displaystyle \left(\mathbb {Z} ,+\right)}, has been described above. The integers, with the operation of multiplication instead of addition, (Z,⋅){\displaystyle \left(\mathbb {Z} ,\cdot \right)} do not form a group. The associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, a=2{\displaystyle a=2} is an integer, but the only solution to the equation a⋅b=1{\displaystyle a\cdot b=1} in this case is b=12{\displaystyle b={\tfrac {1}{2}}}, which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } has a (multiplicative) inverse.[h]
The integers, together with the operation +{\displaystyle +}, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following definition is developed.
U⋅U=fvR⋅fvR=(fv⋅fv)R=R{\displaystyle U\cdot U=f_{\mathrm {v} }R\cdot f_{\mathrm {v} }R=(f_{\mathrm {v} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {v} })R=R}
More sophisticated counting techniques, for example, counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: Lagrange's Theorem states that for a finite group G{\displaystyle G} the order of any finite subgroup H{\displaystyle H} divides the order of G{\displaystyle G}. The Sylow theorems give a partial converse.
Given elements a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} of a group G{\displaystyle G}, there is a unique solution x{\displaystyle x} in G{\displaystyle G} to the equation a⋅x=b{\displaystyle a\cdot x=b}, namely a−1⋅b{\displaystyle a^{-1}\cdot b}. (One usually avoids using fraction notation ba{\displaystyle {\tfrac {b}{a}}} unless G{\displaystyle G} is abelian, because of the ambiguity of whether it means a−1⋅b{\displaystyle a^{-1}\cdot b} or b⋅a−1{\displaystyle b\cdot a^{-1}}.)[29] It follows that for each a{\displaystyle a} in G{\displaystyle G}, the function G→G{\displaystyle G\to G} that maps each x{\displaystyle x} to a⋅x{\displaystyle a\cdot x} is a bijection; it is called left multiplication by a{\displaystyle a} or left translation by a{\displaystyle a}.

Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an n-ary operation (i.e., an operation taking n arguments, for some nonnegative integer n). With the proper generalization of the group axioms, this gives a notion of n-ary group.[88]

This way of defining groups lends itself to generalizations such as the notion of group object in a category.Briefly, this is an object with morphisms that mimic the group axioms.[75]
Some authors include an additional axiom referred to as the closure under the operation "⋅{\displaystyle \cdot }", which means that a⋅b{\displaystyle a\cdot b} is an element of G{\displaystyle G} for every a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} in G{\displaystyle G}. This condition is subsumed by requiring "⋅{\displaystyle \cdot }" to be a binary operation on G{\displaystyle G}. See Lang 2002.
The left cosets of any subgroup H{\displaystyle H} form a partition of G{\displaystyle G}; that is, the union of all left cosets is equal to G{\displaystyle G} and two left cosets are either equal or have an empty intersection.[35] The first case g1H=g2H{\displaystyle g_{1}H=g_{2}H} happens precisely when g1−1⋅g2∈H{\displaystyle g_{1}^{-1}\cdot g_{2}\in H}, i.e., when the two elements differ by an element of H{\displaystyle H}. Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of H{\displaystyle H}. The left cosets of H{\displaystyle H} may or may not be the same as its right cosets. If they are (that is, if all g{\displaystyle g} in G{\displaystyle G} satisfy gH=Hg{\displaystyle gH=Hg}), then H{\displaystyle H} is said to be a normal subgroup.
Examples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition multiplication is considered, one obtains multiplicative groups. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in abstract algebra.

Modular arithmetic for a modulus n{\displaystyle n} defines any two elements a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} that differ by a multiple of n{\displaystyle n} to be equivalent, denoted by a≡b(modn){\displaystyle a\equiv b{\pmod {n}}}. Every integer is equivalent to one of the integers from 0{\displaystyle 0} to n−1{\displaystyle n-1}, and the operations of modular arithmetic modify normal arithmetic by replacing the result of any operation by its equivalent representative. Modular addition, defined in this way for the integers from 0{\displaystyle 0} to n−1{\displaystyle n-1}, forms a group, denoted as Zn{\displaystyle \mathrm {Z} _{n}} or (Z/nZ,+){\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} ,+)}, with 0{\displaystyle 0} as the identity element and n−a{\displaystyle n-a} as the inverse element of a{\displaystyle a}.

Such spontaneous symmetry breaking has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of Goldstone bosons.[55]
Modern Galois theory generalizes the above type of Galois groups by shifting to field theory and considering field extensions formed as the splitting field of a polynomial. This theory establishes—via the fundamental theorem of Galois theory—a precise relationship between fields and groups, underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics.[70]
Representation theory is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups.[63][64] It studies the group by its group actions on other spaces. A broad class of group representations are linear representations in which the group acts on a vector space, such as the three-dimensional Euclidean space R3{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}. A representation of a group G{\displaystyle G} on an n{\displaystyle n}-dimensional real vector space is simply a group homomorphismρ:G→GL(n,R){\displaystyle \rho :G\to \mathrm {GL} (n,\mathbb {R} )}from the group to the general linear group. This way, the group operation, which may be abstractly given, translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations.[q]
The gap between the classification of simple groups and the classification of all groups lies in the extension problem.[74]

For any prime number p{\displaystyle p}, there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo p{\displaystyle p}.[43] Its elements can be represented by 1{\displaystyle 1} to p−1{\displaystyle p-1}. The group operation, multiplication modulo p{\displaystyle p}, replaces the usual product by its representative, the remainder of division by p{\displaystyle p}. For example, for p=5{\displaystyle p=5}, the four group elements can be represented by 1,2,3,4{\displaystyle 1,2,3,4}. In this group, 4⋅4≡1mod5{\displaystyle 4\cdot 4\equiv 1{\bmod {5}}}, because the usual product 16{\displaystyle 16} is equivalent to 1{\displaystyle 1}: when divided by 5{\displaystyle 5} it yields a remainder of 1{\displaystyle 1}. The primality of p{\displaystyle p} ensures that the usual product of two representatives is not divisible by p{\displaystyle p}, and therefore that the modular product is nonzero.[l] The identity element is represented by 1{\displaystyle 1}, and associativity follows from the corresponding property of the integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer a{\displaystyle a} not divisible by p{\displaystyle p}, there exists an integer b{\displaystyle b} such that

Symmetry groups are groups consisting of symmetries of given mathematical objects, principally geometric entities, such as the symmetry group of the square given as an introductory example above, although they also arise in algebra such as the symmetries among the roots of polynomial equations dealt with in Galois theory (see below).[51] Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry.[o] Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element can be associated to some operation on X and the composition of these operations follows the group law. For example, an element of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on a triangular tiling of the hyperbolic plane by permuting the triangles.[50] By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.
^ Some authors include an additional axiom referred to as the closure under the operation "⋅{\displaystyle \cdot }", which means that a⋅b{\displaystyle a\cdot b} is an element of G{\displaystyle G} for every a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} in G{\displaystyle G}. This condition is subsumed by requiring "⋅{\displaystyle \cdot }" to be a binary operation on G{\displaystyle G}. See Lang 2002.

Inverse element: Each symmetry has an inverse: id{\displaystyle \mathrm {id} }, the reflections fh{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {h} }}, fv{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {v} }}, fd{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {d} }}, fc{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {c} }} and the 180° rotation r2{\displaystyle r_{2}} are their own inverse, because performing them twice brings the square back to its original orientation. The rotations r3{\displaystyle r_{3}} and r1{\displaystyle r_{1}} are each other's inverses, because rotating 90° and then rotation 270° (or vice versa) yields a rotation over 360° which leaves the square unchanged. This is easily verified on the table.
Group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.[54]

The elements of the quotient group D4/R{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}/R} are R{\displaystyle R} and U=fvR{\displaystyle U=f_{\mathrm {v} }R}. The group operation on the quotient is shown in the table. For example, U⋅U=fvR⋅fvR=(fv⋅fv)R=R{\displaystyle U\cdot U=f_{\mathrm {v} }R\cdot f_{\mathrm {v} }R=(f_{\mathrm {v} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {v} })R=R}. Both the subgroup R={id,r1,r2,r3}{\displaystyle R=\{\mathrm {id} ,r_{1},r_{2},r_{3}\}} and the quotient D4/R{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}/R} are abelian, but D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}} is not.Sometimes a group can be reconstructed from a subgroup and quotient (plus some additional data), by the semidirect product construction; D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}} is an example.
For example, consider the set of real numbers R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }, which has the operations of addition a+b{\displaystyle a+b} and multiplication ab{\displaystyle ab}. Formally, R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is a set, (R,+){\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,+)} is a group, and (R,+,⋅){\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,+,\cdot )} is a field. But it is common to write R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } to denote any of these three objects.

The third field contributing to group theory was number theory. Certain abelian group structures had been used implicitly in Carl Friedrich Gauss's number-theoretical work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1798), and more explicitly by Leopold Kronecker.[17] In 1847, Ernst Kummer made early attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theoremby developing groups describing factorization into prime numbers.[18]
A familiar example is addition of hours on the face of a clock, where 12 rather than 0 is chosen as the representative of the identity. If the hour hand is on 9{\displaystyle 9} and is advanced 4{\displaystyle 4} hours, it ends up on 1{\displaystyle 1}, as shown in the illustration. This is expressed by saying that 9+4{\displaystyle 9+4} is congruent to 1{\displaystyle 1} "modulo 12{\displaystyle 12}" or, in symbols,
One of the more familiar groups is the set of integers

A group action gives further means to study the object being acted on.[r] On the other hand, it also yields information about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups, Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups, especially (locally) compact groups.[63][65]
Formally, the group is the ordered pair of a set and a binary operation on this set that satisfies the group axioms. The set is called the underlying set of the group, and the operation is called the group operation or the group law.
An example is group cohomology of a group which equals the singular cohomology of its classifying space, see Weibel 1994, §8.2.
The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with Camille Jordan's Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques (1870).[19] Walther von Dyck (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an "abstract group", in the terminology of the time.[20] As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and William Burnside, who worked on representation theory of finite groups, Richard Brauer's modular representation theory and Issai Schur's papers.[21] The theory of Lie groups, and more generally locally compact groups was studied by Hermann Weyl, Élie Cartan and many others.[22] Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of algebraic groups, was first shaped by Claude Chevalley (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of Armand Borel and Jacques Tits.[23]
In chemical fields, such as crystallography, space groups and point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties.[52] For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.[53]

Given any subset S{\displaystyle S} of a group G{\displaystyle G}, the subgroup generated by S{\displaystyle S} consists of all products of elements of S{\displaystyle S} and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of G{\displaystyle G} containing S{\displaystyle S}.[33] In the example of symmetries of a square, the subgroup generated by r2{\displaystyle r_{2}} and fv{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {v} }} consists of these two elements, the identity element id{\displaystyle \mathrm {id} }, and the element fh=fv⋅r2{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {h} }=f_{\mathrm {v} }\cdot r_{2}}. Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.
More rigorously, every group is the symmetry group of some graph; see Frucht's theorem, Frucht 1939.
The classification of all finite simple groups was a major achievement in contemporary group theory.There are several infinite families of such groups, as well as 26 "sporadic groups" that do not belong to any of the families.The largest sporadic group is called the monster group. The monstrous moonshine conjectures, proved by Richard Borcherds, relate the monster group to certain modular functions.[73]

When a group G{\displaystyle G} has a normal subgroup N{\displaystyle N} other than {1}{\displaystyle \{1\}} and G{\displaystyle G} itself, questions about G{\displaystyle G} can sometimes be reduced to questions about N{\displaystyle N} and G/N{\displaystyle G/N}.A nontrivial group is called simple if it has no such normal subgroup.Finite simple groups are to finite groups as prime numbers are to positive integers: they serve as building blocks, in a sense made precise by the Jordan–Hölder theorem.

When studying sets, one uses concepts such as subset, function, and quotient by an equivalence relation. When studying groups, one uses instead subgroups, homomorphisms, and quotient groups. These are the analogues that take the group structure into account.[c]

The desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering fractions
The axioms for a group are short and natural... Yet somehow hidden behind these axioms is the monster simple group, a huge and extraordinary mathematical object, which appears to rely on numerous bizarre coincidences to exist. The axioms for groups give no obvious hint that anything like this exists.
Up to isomorphism, there are about 49 billion groups of order up to 2000. See Besche, Eick & O'Brien 2001.

The University of Chicago's 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as Daniel Gorenstein, John G. Thompson and Walter Feit, laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the classification of finite simple groups, with the final step taken by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research concerning this classification proof is ongoing.[24] Group theory remains a highly active mathematical branch,[b] impacting many other fields, as the examples below illustrate.
Finite symmetry groups such as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players.[59] Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved.[p] Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.[60]
Matrix groups consist of matrices together with matrix multiplication. The general linear group GL(n,R){\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} (n,\mathbb {R} )} consists of all invertible n{\displaystyle n}-by-n{\displaystyle n} matrices with real entries.[61] Its subgroups are referred to as matrix groups or linear groups. The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group. Another important matrix group is the special orthogonal group SO(n){\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (n)}. It describes all possible rotations in n{\displaystyle n} dimensions. Rotation matrices in this group are used in computer graphics.[62]
The group axioms imply that the identity element is unique: If e{\displaystyle e} and f{\displaystyle f} are identity elements of a group, then e=e⋅f=f{\displaystyle e=e\cdot f=f}. Therefore, it is customary to speak of the identity.[28]

In the groups (Z/nZ,+){\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} ,+)} introduced above, the element 1{\displaystyle 1} is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1{\displaystyle 1}. Any cyclic group with n{\displaystyle n} elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of n{\displaystyle n}th complex roots of unity, given by complex numbers z{\displaystyle z} satisfying zn=1{\displaystyle z^{n}=1}. These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular n{\displaystyle n}-gon, as shown in blue in the image for n=6{\displaystyle n=6}. The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with z{\displaystyle z} corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by 60°.[47] From field theory, the group Fp×{\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{p}^{\times }} is cyclic for prime p{\displaystyle p}: for example, if p=5{\displaystyle p=5}, 3{\displaystyle 3} is a generator since 31=3{\displaystyle 3^{1}=3}, 32=9≡4{\displaystyle 3^{2}=9\equiv 4}, 33≡2{\displaystyle 3^{3}\equiv 2}, and 34≡1{\displaystyle 3^{4}\equiv 1}.

For example, a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is necessarily cyclic. See Lang 2002, Theorem IV.1.9. The notions of torsion of a module and simple algebras are other instances of this principle.
For example, the dihedral group D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}} is generated by the right rotation r1{\displaystyle r_{1}} and the reflection fv{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {v} }} in a vertical line (every element of D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}} is a finite product of copies of these and their inverses).Hence there is a surjective homomorphism φ from the free group ⟨r,f⟩{\displaystyle \langle r,f\rangle } on two generators to D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}} sending r{\displaystyle r} to r1{\displaystyle r_{1}} and f{\displaystyle f} to f1{\displaystyle f_{1}}.Elements in ker⁡ϕ{\displaystyle \ker \phi } are called relations; examples include r4,r2,(r⋅f)2{\displaystyle r^{4},r^{2},(r\cdot f)^{2}}.In fact, it turns out that ker⁡ϕ{\displaystyle \ker \phi } is the smallest normal subgroup of ⟨r,f⟩{\displaystyle \langle r,f\rangle } containing these three elements; in other words, all relations are consequences of these three.The quotient of the free group by this normal subgroup is denoted ⟨r,f∣r4=f2=(r⋅f)2=1⟩{\displaystyle \langle r,f\mid r^{4}=f^{2}=(r\cdot f)^{2}=1\rangle }.This is called a presentation of D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}} by generators and relations, because the first isomorphism theorem for φ yields an isomorphism ⟨r,f∣r4=f2=(r⋅f)2=1⟩→D4{\displaystyle \langle r,f\mid r^{4}=f^{2}=(r\cdot f)^{2}=1\rangle \to \mathrm {D} _{4}}.[37]

In addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. Cryptography relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups.[42] Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept.
^ The same is true for any field F instead of Q{\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }. See Lang 2005, p. 86, §III.1.
Informally, a subgroup is a group H{\displaystyle H} contained within a bigger one, G{\displaystyle G}: it has a subset of the elements of G{\displaystyle G}, with the same operation.[32] Concretely, this means that the identity element of G{\displaystyle G} must be contained in H{\displaystyle H}, and whenever h1{\displaystyle h_{1}} and h2{\displaystyle h_{2}} are both in H{\displaystyle H}, then so are h1⋅h2{\displaystyle h_{1}\cdot h_{2}} and h1−1{\displaystyle h_{1}^{-1}}, so the elements of H{\displaystyle H}, equipped with the group operation on G{\displaystyle G} restricted to H{\displaystyle H}, indeed form a group.In this case, the inclusion map H→G{\displaystyle H\to G} is a homomorphism.
More generally, one speaks of an additive group whenever the group operation is notated as addition; in this case, the identity is typically denoted 0{\displaystyle 0}, and the inverse of an element x{\displaystyle x} is denoted −x{\displaystyle -x}. Similarly, one speaks of a multiplicative group whenever the group operation is notated as multiplication; in this case, the identity is typically denoted 1{\displaystyle 1}, and the inverse of an element x{\displaystyle x} is denoted x−1{\displaystyle x^{-1}}. In a multiplicative group, the operation symbol is usually omitted entirely, so that the operation is denoted by juxtaposition, ab{\displaystyle ab} instead of a⋅b{\displaystyle a\cdot b}.

The rational numbers (including zero) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called rings and – if division by other than zero is possible, such as in Q{\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } – fields, which occupy a central position in abstract algebra. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.[k]

Every group is isomorphic to a quotient of a free group, in many ways.
Similarly, given a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}, the unique solution to x⋅a=b{\displaystyle x\cdot a=b} is b⋅a−1{\displaystyle b\cdot a^{-1}}. For each a{\displaystyle a}, the function G→G{\displaystyle G\to G} that maps each x{\displaystyle x} to x⋅a{\displaystyle x\cdot a} is a bijection called right multiplication by a{\displaystyle a} or right translation by a{\displaystyle a}.
If a{\displaystyle a} is any integer, then 0+a=a{\displaystyle 0+a=a} and a+0=a{\displaystyle a+0=a}. Zero is called the identity element of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer.

Given this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows.

Many number systems, such as the integers and the rationals, enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.
More precisely, the monodromy action on the vector space of solutions of the differential equations is considered. See Kuga 1993, pp. 105–113.

Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group.[39] By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.[f] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.

For example, class groups and Picard groups; see Neukirch 1999, in particular §§I.12 and I.13
The definition of a group does not require that a⋅b=b⋅a{\displaystyle a\cdot b=b\cdot a} for all elements a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} in G{\displaystyle G}. If this additional condition holds, then the operation is said to be commutative, and the group is called an abelian group. It is a common convention that for an abelian group either additive or multiplicative notation may be used, but for a nonabelian group only multiplicative notation is used.
In contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is immaterial, it does matter in D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}}, as, for example, fh∘r1=fc{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {h} }\circ r_{1}=f_{\mathrm {c} }} but r1∘fh=fd{\displaystyle r_{1}\circ f_{\mathrm {h} }=f_{\mathrm {d} }}. In other words, D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}} is not abelian.
An equivalent definition of group consists of replacing the "there exist" part of the group axioms by operations whose result is the element that must exist. So, a group is a set G{\displaystyle G} equipped with a binary operation G×G→G{\displaystyle G\times G\rightarrow G} (the group operation), a unary operation G→G{\displaystyle G\rightarrow G} (which provides the inverse) and a nullary operation, which has no operand and results in the identity element. Otherwise, the group axioms are exactly the same. This variant of the definition avoids existential quantifiers and is used in computing with groups and for computer-aided proofs.
The concept of a group arose in the study of polynomial equations, starting with Évariste Galois in the 1830s, who introduced the term group (French: groupe) for the symmetry group of the roots of an equation, now called a Galois group. After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right. To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of representation theory (that is, through the representations of the group) and of computational group theory. A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004. Since the mid-1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become an active area in group theory.

Lie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities.[82] Rotation, as well as translations in space and time, are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description.[t] Another example is the group of Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of spacetime in special relativity.[83] The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories.[84] Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory. An important example of a gauge theory is the Standard Model, which describes three of the four known fundamental forces and classifies all known elementary particles.[85]

Some cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements. In these groups, for every non-zero element a{\displaystyle a}, all the powers of a{\displaystyle a} are distinct; despite the name "cyclic group", the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to (Z,+){\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} ,+)}, the group of integers under addition introduced above.[48] As these two prototypes are both abelian, so are all cyclic groups.

Associativity: The associativity axiom deals with composing more than two symmetries: Starting with three elements a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b} and c{\displaystyle c} of D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}}, there are two possible ways of using these three symmetries in this order to determine a symmetry of the square. One of these ways is to first compose a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} into a single symmetry, then to compose that symmetry with c{\displaystyle c}. The other way is to first compose b{\displaystyle b} and c{\displaystyle c}, then to compose the resulting symmetry with a{\displaystyle a}. These two ways must give always the same result, that is,

Several other notations are commonly used for groups whose elements are not numbers. For a group whose elements are functions, the operation is often function composition f∘g{\displaystyle f\circ g}; then the identity may be denoted id. In the more specific cases of geometric transformation groups, symmetry groups, permutation groups, and automorphism groups, the symbol ∘{\displaystyle \circ } is often omitted, as for multiplicative groups. Many other variants of notation may be encountered.
^ The word homomorphism derives from Greek ὁμός—the same and μορφή—structure. See Schwartzman 1994, p. 108.
These symmetries are functions. Each sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, r1{\displaystyle r_{1}} sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square's center, and fh{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {h} }} sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetries gives another symmetry. These symmetries determine a group called the dihedral group of degree four, denoted D4{\displaystyle \mathrm {D} _{4}}. The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetries, and the group operation is function composition.[8] Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application. The result of performing first a{\displaystyle a} and then b{\displaystyle b} is written symbolically from right to left as b∘a{\displaystyle b\circ a} ("apply the symmetry b{\displaystyle b} after performing the symmetry a{\displaystyle a}"). This is the usual notation for composition of functions.

The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics.[9][10][11] The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois's ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously.[12][13] More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. Arthur Cayley's On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θn=1{\displaystyle \theta ^{n}=1} (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.[14]
Group homomorphisms[d] are functions that respect group structure; they may be used to relate two groups. A homomorphism from a group (G,⋅){\displaystyle (G,\cdot )} to a group (H,∗){\displaystyle (H,*)} is a function φ:G→H{\displaystyle \varphi \colon G\to H} such that

A Lie group is a group that also has the structure of a differentiable manifold; informally, this means that it looks locally like a Euclidean space of some fixed dimension.[80] Again, the definition requires the additional structure, here the manifold structure, to be compatible: the multiplication and inverse maps are required to be smooth.

That characterizes the Lebesgue outer measure. Whether this outer measure translates to the Lebesgue measure proper depends on an additional condition. This condition is tested by taking subsets A{\displaystyle A} of the real numbers using E{\displaystyle E} as an instrument to split A{\displaystyle A} into two partitions: the part of A{\displaystyle A} which intersects with E{\displaystyle E} and the remaining part of A{\displaystyle A} which is not in E{\displaystyle E}: the set difference of A{\displaystyle A} and E{\displaystyle E}.These partitions of A{\displaystyle A} are subject to the outer measure. If for all possible such subsets A{\displaystyle A} of the real numbers, the partitions of A{\displaystyle A} cut apart by E{\displaystyle E} have outer measures whose sum is the outer measure of A{\displaystyle A}, then the outer Lebesgue measure of E{\displaystyle E} gives its Lebesgue measure. Intuitively, this condition means that the set E{\displaystyle E} must not have some curious properties which causes a discrepancy in the measure of another set when E{\displaystyle E} is used as a "mask" to "clip" that set, hinting at the existence of sets for which the Lebesgue outer measure does not give the Lebesgue measure. (Such sets are, in fact, not Lebesgue-measurable.)
In measure theory, a branch of mathematics, the Lebesgue measure, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space. For n = 1, 2, or 3, it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called n-dimensional volume, n-volume, or simply volume.[1] It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue integration. Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called Lebesgue-measurable; the measure of the Lebesgue-measurable set A is here denoted by λ(A).

If the axiom of determinacy holds then all sets of reals are Lebesgue-measurable. Determinacy is however not compatible with the axiom of choice.
Moreover, every Borel set is Lebesgue-measurable. However, there are Lebesgue-measurable sets which are not Borel sets.[5][6]
A Lebesgue-measurable set can be "squeezed" between a containing Gδ set and a contained Fσ. I.e, if A is Lebesgue-measurable then there exist a Gδ set G and an Fσ F such that G ⊇ A ⊇ F and λ(G \ A) = λ(A \ F) = 0.
These Lebesgue-measurable sets form a σ-algebra, and the Lebesgue measure is defined by λ(A) = λ*(A) for any Lebesgue-measurable set A.
The modern construction of the Lebesgue measure is an application of Carathéodory's extension theorem. It proceeds as follows.
It can be shown that there is no infinite-dimensional analogue of Lebesgue measure.

Lebesgue measure is both locally finite and inner regular, and so it is a Radon measure.
The first part of the definition states that the subset E{\displaystyle E} of the real numbers is reduced to its outer measure by coverage by sets of open intervals.Each of these sets of intervals I{\displaystyle I} covers E{\displaystyle E} in a sense, since the union of these intervals contains E{\displaystyle E}. The total length of any covering interval set may overestimate the measure of E,{\displaystyle E,} because E{\displaystyle E} is a subset of the union of the intervals, and so the intervals may include points which are not in E{\displaystyle E}. The Lebesgue outer measure emerges as the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the lengths from among all possible such sets. Intuitively, it is the total length of those interval sets which fit E{\displaystyle E} most tightly and do not overlap.
The set of all such E{\displaystyle E} forms a σ-algebra. For any such E{\displaystyle E}, its Lebesgue measure is defined to be its Lebesgue outer measure: λ(E)=λ∗(E){\displaystyle \lambda (E)=\lambda ^{\!*\!}(E)}.
If A is a disjoint union of countably many disjoint Lebesgue-measurable sets, then A is itself Lebesgue-measurable and λ(A) is equal to the sum (or infinite series) of the measures of the involved measurable sets.
Countable unions and intersections of Lebesgue-measurable sets are Lebesgue-measurable. (Not a consequence of 2 and 3, because a family of sets that is closed under complements and disjoint countable unions does not need to be closed under countable unions: {∅,{1,2,3,4},{1,2},{3,4},{1,3},{2,4}}{\displaystyle \{\emptyset ,\{1,2,3,4\},\{1,2\},\{3,4\},\{1,3\},\{2,4\}\}}.)

In 1970, Robert M. Solovay showed that the existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable is not provable within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in the absence of the axiom of choice (see Solovay's model).[9]
Any Cartesian product of intervals [a, b] and [c, d] is Lebesgue-measurable, and its Lebesgue measure is (b − a)(d − c), the area of the corresponding rectangle.
A Lebesgue-measurable set can be "squeezed" between a containing open set and a contained closed set.This property has been used as an alternative definition of Lebesgue measurability.More precisely, E⊂R{\displaystyle E\subset \mathbb {R} } is Lebesgue-measurable if and only if for every ε>0{\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} there exist an open set G{\displaystyle G} and a closed set F{\displaystyle F} such that F⊂E⊂G{\displaystyle F\subset E\subset G} and λ(G∖F)<ε{\displaystyle \lambda (G\setminus F)<\varepsilon }.[8]
If a subset of Rn has Hausdorff dimension less than n then it is a null set with respect to n-dimensional Lebesgue measure.Here Hausdorff dimension is relative to the Euclidean metric on Rn (or any metric Lipschitz equivalent to it). On the other hand, a set may have topological dimension less than n and have positive n-dimensional Lebesgue measure.An example of this is the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set which has topological dimension 0 yet has positive 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure.

The existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable is a consequence of the set-theoretical axiom of choice, which is independent from many of the conventional systems of axioms for set theory. The Vitali theorem, which follows from the axiom, states that there exist subsets of R that are not Lebesgue-measurable. Assuming the axiom of choice, non-measurable sets with many surprising properties have been demonstrated, such as those of the Banach–Tarski paradox.
Any countable set of real numbers has Lebesgue measure 0. In particular, the Lebesgue measure of the set of algebraic numbers is 0, even though the set is dense in R.

In order to show that a given set A is Lebesgue-measurable, one usually tries to find a "nicer" set B which differs from A only by a null set (in the sense that the symmetric difference (A − B) ∪ (B − A) is a null set) and then show that B can be generated using countable unions and intersections from open or closed sets.
The Borel measure agrees with the Lebesgue measure on those sets for which it is defined; however, there are many more Lebesgue-measurable sets than there are Borel measurable sets. The Borel measure is translation-invariant, but not complete.

If a rotation around a point or axis is followed by a second rotation around the same point/axis, a third rotation results. The reverse (inverse) of a rotation is also a rotation. Thus, the rotations around a point/axis form a group. However, a rotation around a point or axis and a rotation around a different point/axis may result in something other than a rotation, e.g. a translation.
The laws of physics are currently believed to be invariant under any fixed rotation. (Although they do appear to change when viewed from a rotating viewpoint: see rotating frame of reference.)
The angular velocity vector (an axial vector) also describes the direction of the axis of rotation. Similarly the torque is an axial vector.

Another consequence of the rotation of a planet is the phenomenon of precession. Like a gyroscope, the overall effect is a slight "wobble" in the movement of the axis of a planet. Currently the tilt of the Earth's axis to its orbital plane (obliquity of the ecliptic) is 23.44 degrees, but this angle changes slowly (over thousands of years). (See also Precession of the equinoxes and Pole star.)
While revolution is often used as a synonym for rotation, in many fields, particularly astronomy and related fields, revolution, often referred to as orbital revolution for clarity, is used when one body moves around another while rotation is used to mean the movement around an axis. Moons revolve around their planet, planets revolve about their star (such as the Earth around the Sun); and stars slowly revolve about their galaxial center. The motion of the components of galaxies is complex, but it usually includes a rotation component.
Rotation of a player one or more times around a vertical axis may be called spin in figure skating, twirling (of the baton or the performer) in baton twirling, or 360, 540, 720, etc. in snowboarding, etc. Rotation of a player or performer one or more times around a horizontal axis may be called a flip, roll, somersault, heli, etc. in gymnastics, waterskiing, or many other sports, or a one-and-a-half, two-and-a-half, gainer (starting facing away from the water), etc. in diving, etc. A combination of vertical and horizontal rotation (back flip with 360°) is called a möbius in waterskiing freestyle jumping.
2 dimensional rotations, unlike the 3 dimensional ones, possess no axis of rotation. This is equivalent, for linear transformations, with saying that there is no direction in the plane which is kept unchanged by a 2 dimensional rotation, except, of course, the identity.

The question of the existence of such a direction is the question of existence of an eigenvector for the matrix A representing the rotation. Every 2D rotation around the origin through an angle θ{\displaystyle \theta } in counterclockwise direction can be quite simply represented by the following matrix:
This discussion applies to a proper rotation, and hence detA=1{\displaystyle \det A=1}. Any improper orthogonal 3x3 matrix B{\displaystyle B} may be written as B=−A{\displaystyle B=-A}, in which A{\displaystyle A} is proper orthogonal. That is, any improper orthogonal 3x3 matrix may be decomposed as a proper rotation (from which an axis of rotation can be found as described above) followed by an inversion (multiplication by -1). It follows that the rotation axis of A{\displaystyle A} is also the eigenvector of B{\displaystyle B} corresponding to an eigenvalue of -1.
In astronomy, rotation is a commonly observed phenomenon. Stars, planets and similar bodies all spin around on their axes. The rotation rate of planets in the solar system was first measured by tracking visual features. Stellar rotation is measured through Doppler shift or by tracking active surface features.
The physics of the rotation around a fixed axis is mathematically described with the axis–angle representation of rotations. According to the right-hand rule, the direction away from the observer is associated with clockwise rotation and the direction towards the observer with counterclockwise rotation, like a screw.
A rotation is simply a progressive radial orientation to a common point. That common point lies within the axis of that motion. The axis is 90 degrees perpendicular to the plane of the motion.
Rotation of a ball or other object, usually called spin, plays a role in many sports, including topspin and backspin in tennis, English, follow and draw in billiards and pool, curve balls in baseball, spin bowling in cricket, flying disc sports, etc. Table tennis paddles are manufactured with different surface characteristics to allow the player to impart a greater or lesser amount of spin to the ball.
In modern physical cosmology, the cosmological principle is the notion that the distribution of matter in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe and have no preferred direction, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the Big Bang.

In particular, for a system which behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space, its Lagrangian is rotationally invariant. According to Noether's theorem, if the action (the integral over time of its Lagrangian) of a physical system is invariant under rotation, then angular momentum is conserved.
Mathematically, a rotation is a rigid body movement which, unlike a translation, keeps a point fixed. This definition applies to rotations within both two and three dimensions (in a plane and in space, respectively.)

This rotation induces a centrifugal acceleration in the reference frame of the Earth which slightly counteracts the effect of gravitation the closer one is to the equator. Earth's gravity combines both mass effects such that an object weighs slightly less at the equator than at the poles. Another is that over time the Earth is slightly deformed into an oblate spheroid; a similar equatorial bulge develops for other planets.
Using the principal arc-cosine, this formula gives a rotation angle satisfying 0≤α≤180∘{\displaystyle 0\leq \alpha \leq 180^{\circ }}. The corresponding rotation axis must be defined to point in a direction that limits the rotation angle to not exceed 180 degrees. (This can always be done because any rotation of more than 180 degrees about an axis m{\displaystyle m} can always be written as a rotation having 0≤α≤180∘{\displaystyle 0\leq \alpha \leq 180^{\circ }} if the axis is replaced with n=−m{\displaystyle n=-m}.)

Rotation of a player around a vertical axis, generally between 180 and 360 degrees, may be called a spin move and is used as a deceptive or avoidance maneuver, or in an attempt to play, pass, or receive a ball or puck, etc., or to afford a player a view of the goal or other players. It is often seen in hockey, basketball, football of various codes, tennis, etc.
This means v+v¯{\displaystyle v+{\bar {v}}} and i(v−v¯){\displaystyle i(v-{\bar {v}})} are orthogonal vectors. Also, they are both real vectors by construction. These vectors span the same subspace as v{\displaystyle v} and v¯{\displaystyle {\bar {v}}}, which is an invariant subspace under the application of A. Therefore, they span an invariant plane.
Rotation, or spin, is the circular movement of an object around a central axis. A two-dimensional rotating object has only one possible central axis and can rotate in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. A three-dimensional object has an infinite number of possible central axes and rotational directions.
because, since v¯Tv¯{\displaystyle {\bar {v}}^{\text{T}}{\bar {v}}} is real, it equals its complex conjugate vTv{\displaystyle v^{\text{T}}v}, and v¯Tv{\displaystyle {\bar {v}}^{\text{T}}v} and vTv¯{\displaystyle v^{\text{T}}{\bar {v}}} are both representations of the same scalar product between v{\displaystyle v} and v¯{\displaystyle {\bar {v}}}.

The proof proceeds similarly to the above discussion. First, suppose that all eigenvalues of the 3D rotation matrix A are real. This means that there is an orthogonal basis, made by the corresponding eigenvectors (which are necessarily orthogonal), over which the effect of the rotation matrix is just stretching it. If we write A in this basis, it is diagonal; but a diagonal orthogonal matrix is made of just +1s and −1s in the diagonal entries. Therefore, we don't have a proper rotation, but either the identity or the result of a sequence of reflections.

Rotation, Reflection, and Frame Change: Orthogonal tensors in computational engineering mechanics

Most planets in the Solar System, including Earth, spin in the same direction as they orbit the Sun. The exceptions are Venus and Uranus. Venus may be thought of as rotating slowly backward (or being "upside down"). Uranus rotates nearly on its side relative to its orbit. Current speculation is that Uranus started off with a typical prograde orientation and was knocked on its side by a large impact early in its history. The dwarf planet Pluto (formerly considered a planet) is anomalous in several ways, including that it also rotates on its side.
A spectral analysis is not required to find the rotation axis. If n{\displaystyle n} denotes the unit eigenvector aligned with the rotation axis, and if α{\displaystyle \alpha } denotes the rotation angle, then it can be shown that 2sin⁡(α)n={A32−A23,A13−A31,A21−A12}{\displaystyle 2\sin(\alpha )n=\{A_{32}-A_{23},A_{13}-A_{31},A_{21}-A_{12}\}}. Consequently, the expense of an eigenvalue analysis can be avoided by simply normalizing this vector if it has a nonzero magnitude. On the other hand, if this vector has a zero magnitude, it means that sin⁡(α)=0{\displaystyle \sin(\alpha )=0}. In other words, this vector will be zero if and only if the rotation angle is 0 or 180 degrees, and the rotation axis may be assigned in this case by normalizing any column of A+I{\displaystyle A+I} that has a nonzero magnitude.[2]
This plane is orthogonal to the invariant axis, which corresponds to the remaining eigenvector of A, with eigenvalue 1, because of the orthogonality of the eigenvectors of A.
Rotations around the x, y and z axes are called principal rotations. Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the y axis, and followed by a rotation around the z axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.
Knowing that the trace is an invariant, the rotation angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } for a proper orthogonal 3x3 rotation matrix A{\displaystyle A} is found by

As much as every tridimensional rotation has a rotation axis, also every tridimensional rotation has a plane, which is perpendicular to the rotation axis, and which is left invariant by the rotation. The rotation, restricted to this plane, is an ordinary 2D rotation.
Every proper rotation A{\displaystyle A} in 3D space has an axis of rotation, which is defined such that any vector v{\displaystyle v} that is aligned with the rotation axis will not be affected by rotation. Accordingly, Av=v{\displaystyle Av=v}, and the rotation axis therefore corresponds to an eigenvector of the rotation matrix associated with an eigenvalue of 1. As long as the rotation angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } is nonzero (i.e., the rotation is not the identity tensor), there is one and only one such direction. Because A has only real components, there is at least one real eigenvalue, and the remaining two eigenvalues must be complex conjugates of each other (see Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Eigenvalues and the characteristic polynomial). Knowing that 1 is an eigenvalue, it follows that the remaining two eigenvalues are complex conjugates of each other, but this does not imply that they are complex—they could be real with double multiplicity. In the degenerate case of a rotation angle α=180∘{\displaystyle \alpha =180^{\circ }}, the remaining two eigenvalues are both equal to -1. In the degenerate case of a zero rotation angle, the rotation matrix is the identity, and all three eigenvalues are 1 (which is the only case for which the rotation axis is arbitrary).

Euler rotations provide an alternative description of a rotation. It is a composition of three rotations defined as the movement obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. Euler rotations are never expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.
All rigid body movements are rotations, translations, or combinations of the two.
It follows, then, that a proper rotation has some complex eigenvalue. Let v be the corresponding eigenvector. Then, as we showed in the previous topic, v¯{\displaystyle {\bar {v}}} is also an eigenvector, and v+v¯{\displaystyle v+{\bar {v}}} and i(v−v¯){\displaystyle i(v-{\bar {v}})} are such that their scalar product vanishes:
Rolling – Type of motion which combines translation and rotation with respect to a surface
The end result of any sequence of rotations of any object in 3D about a fixed point is always equivalent to a rotation about an axis. However, an object may physically rotate in 3D about a fixed point on more than one axis simultaneously, in which case there is no single fixed axis of rotation - just the fixed point. However, these two descriptions can be reconciled - such a physical motion can always be re-described in terms of a single axis of rotation, provided the orientation of that axis relative to the object is allowed to change moment by moment.

as its eigenvalues. Therefore, there is no real eigenvalue whenever cos⁡θ≠±1{\displaystyle \cos \theta \neq \pm 1}, meaning that no real vector in the plane is kept unchanged by A.
If the rotation axis passes internally through the body's own center of mass, then the body is said to be autorotating or spinning, and the surface intersection of the axis can be called a pole. A rotation around a completely external axis, e.g. the planet Earth around the Sun, is called revolving or orbiting, typically when it is produced by gravity, and the ends of the rotation axis can be called the orbital poles.
The speed of rotation is given by the angular frequency (rad/s) or frequency (turns per time), or period (seconds, days, etc.). The time-rate of change of angular frequency is angular acceleration (rad/s²), caused by torque. The ratio of the two (how heavy is it to start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the moment of inertia.
Rotation formalisms in three dimensions – Ways to represent 3D rotations
In flight dynamics, the principal rotations described with Euler angles above are known as pitch, roll and yaw. The term rotation is also used in aviation to refer to the upward pitch (nose moves up) of an aircraft, particularly when starting the climb after takeoff.
In flight dynamics, the principal rotations are known as yaw, pitch, and roll (known as Tait–Bryan angles). This terminology is also used in computer graphics.
Principal rotations have the advantage of modelling a number of physical systems such as gimbals, and joysticks, so are easily visualised, and are a very compact way of storing a rotation. But they are difficult to use in calculations as even simple operations like combining rotations are expensive to do, and suffer from a form of gimbal lock where the angles cannot be uniquely calculated for certain rotations.

Any interval exchange transformation Tπ,λ{\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }} is a bijection of [0,1]{\displaystyle [0,1]} to itself that preserves the Lebesgue measure.It is continuous except at a finite number of points.
Two and higher-dimensional generalizations include polygon exchanges, polyhedral exchanges and piecewise isometries.[5]

In mathematics, an interval exchange transformation[1] is a kind of dynamical system that generalises circle rotation.The phase space consists of the unit interval, and the transformation acts by cutting the interval into several subintervals, and then permuting these subintervals.They arise naturally in the study of polygonal billiards and in area-preserving flows.

Veech[2] and to Howard Masur[3] asserts that for almost all choices of λ{\displaystyle \lambda } in the unit simplex {(t1,…,tn):∑ti=1}{\displaystyle \{(t_{1},\dots ,t_{n}):\sum t_{i}=1\}} the interval exchange transformation Tπ,λ{\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }} is again uniquely ergodic.However, for n≥4{\displaystyle n\geq 4} there also exist choices of (π,λ){\displaystyle (\pi ,\lambda )} so that Tπ,λ{\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }} is ergodic but not uniquely ergodic.Even in these cases, the number of ergodic invariant measures of Tπ,λ{\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }} is finite, and is at most n{\displaystyle n}.

If n=2{\displaystyle n=2} and π=(12){\displaystyle \pi =(12)} (in cycle notation), and if we join up the ends of the interval to make a circle, then Tπ,λ{\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }} is just a circle rotation.The Weyl equidistribution theorem then asserts that if the length λ1{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}} is irrational, then Tπ,λ{\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }} is uniquely ergodic. Roughly speaking, this means that the orbits of points of [0,1]{\displaystyle [0,1]} are uniformly evenly distributed.On the other hand, if λ1{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}} is rational then each point of the interval is periodic, and the period is the denominator of λ1{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}} (written in lowest terms).

In mathematics, and more specifically in the theory of C*-algebras, the noncommutative tori Aθ, also known as irrational rotation algebras for irrational values of θ, form a family of noncommutative C*-algebras which generalize the algebra of continuous functions on the 2-torus. Many topological and geometric properties of the classical 2-torus have algebraic analogues for the noncommutative tori, and as such they are fundamental examples of a noncommutative space in the sense of Alain Connes.
Twisted group algebra: The function σ : Z2 × Z2 → C; σ((m,n), (p,q)) = e2πinpθ is a group 2-cocycle on Z2, and the corresponding twisted group algebra C*(Z2; σ) is isomorphic to Aθ.
Irrational rotation algebra: Let the infinite cyclic group Z act on the circle S1 by the rotation action by angle 2πiθ. This induces an action of Z by automorphisms on the algebra of continuous functions C(S1). The resulting C*-crossed product C(S1) ⋊ Z is isomorphic to Aθ. The generating unitaries are the generator of the group Z and the identity function on the circle z : S1 → C.[1]

The K-theory of Aθ is Z2 in both even dimension and odd dimension, and so does not distinguish the irrational rotation algebras. But as an ordered group, K0 ≃ Z + θZ. Therefore, two noncommutative tori Aθ and Aη are isomorphic if and only if either θ + η or θ − η is an integer.[1][2]

Every irrational rotation algebra Aθ is simple, that is, it does not contain any proper closed two-sided ideals other than {0}{\displaystyle \{0\}} and itself.[1]
where e2πit{\displaystyle e^{2\pi it}} is the parametrization of the point z{\displaystyle z} on the circle R/Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} /\mathbb {Z} } in C{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }. A quick calculation shows that VU = e−2π i θUV.[1]
Universal property: Aθ can be defined (up to isomorphism) as the universal C*-algebra generated by two unitary elements U and V satisfying the relation VU = e2π i θUV.[1] This definition extends to the case when θ is rational. In particular when θ = 0, Aθ is isomorphic to continuous functions on the 2-torus by the Gelfand transform.
Two irrational rotation algebras Aθ and Aη are strongly Morita equivalent if and only if θ and η are in the same orbit of the action of SL(2, Z) on R by fractional linear transformations. In particular, the noncommutative tori with θ rational are Morita equivalent to the classical torus. On the other hand, the noncommutative tori with θ irrational are simple C*-algebras.[2]

If f is a rotation by 2πθ (where 0≤θ<1), then
The rotation number of f is a rational number p/q (in the lowest terms). Then f has a periodic orbit, every periodic orbit has period q, and the order of the points on each such orbit coincides with the order of the points for a rotation by p/q. Moreover, every forward orbit of f converges to a periodic orbit. The same is true for backward orbits, corresponding to iterations of f –1, but the limiting periodic orbits in forward and backward directions may be different.
Suppose that f:S1→S1{\displaystyle f:S^{1}\to S^{1}} is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the circle S1=R/Z.{\displaystyle S^{1}=\mathbb {R} /\mathbb {Z} .} Then f may be lifted to a homeomorphism F:R→R{\displaystyle F:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} } of the real line, satisfying
for a monotone continuous map h of the circle into itself (not necessarily homeomorphic) then f and g have the same rotation numbers. It was used by Poincaré and Arnaud Denjoy for topological classification of homeomorphisms of the circle. There are two distinct possibilities.
The rotation number is invariant under topological conjugacy, and even monotone topological semiconjugacy: if f and g are two homeomorphisms of the circle and
The rotation number of f is defined in terms of the iterates of F:
The rotation number of f is an irrational number θ. Then f has no periodic orbits (this follows immediately by considering a periodic point x of f). There are two subcases.
The rotation number is continuous when viewed as a map from the group of homeomorphisms (with C0 topology) of the circle into the circle.

It was first defined by Henri Poincaré in 1885, in relation to the precession of the perihelion of a planetary orbit. Poincaré later proved a theorem characterizing the existence of periodic orbits in terms of rationality of the rotation number.
In mathematics, the rotation number is an invariant of homeomorphisms of the circle.
There exists a Cantor set C invariant under f. Then C is a unique minimal set and the orbits of all points both in forward and backward direction converge to C. In this case, f is semiconjugate to the irrational rotation by θ, and the semiconjugating map h of degree 1 is constant on components of the complement of C.

Sebastian van Strien, Rotation Numbers and Poincaré's Theorem (2001)[permanent dead link]
There exists a dense orbit. In this case f is topologically conjugate to the irrational rotation by the angle θ and all orbits are dense. Denjoy proved that this possibility is always realized when f is twice continuously differentiable.
Henri Poincaré proved that the limit exists and is independent of the choice of the starting point x. The lift F is unique modulo integers, therefore the rotation number is a well-defined element of R/Z.{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} /\mathbb {Z} .} Intuitively, it measures the average rotation angle along the orbits of f.
