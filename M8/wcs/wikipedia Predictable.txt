In stochastic analysis, a part of the mathematical theory of probability, a predictable process is a stochastic process whose value is knowable at a prior time.The predictable processes form the smallest class that is closed under taking limits of sequences and contains all adapted left-continuous processes.[clarification needed]

Animals have significantly more predictable behavior than humans. Driven by natural selection, animals develop mating calls, predator warnings, and communicative dances. One example of these engrained behaviors is the Belding's ground squirrel, which developed a specific set of calls that warn nearby squirrels about predators. If a ground squirrel sees a predator on land it will elicit a trill after it gets to safety, which signals to nearby squirrels that they should stand up on their hind legs and attempt to locate the predator. When a predator is seen in the air, a ground squirrel will immediately call out a long whistle, putting himself in danger but signaling for nearby squirrels to run for cover. Through experimentation and examination scientists have been able to chart behaviors like this and very accurately predict how animals behave in certain situations.[15]

Significant debate exists in the scientific community over whether or not a person's behavior is completely predictable based on their genetics. Studies such as the one in Israel, which showed that judges were more likely to give a lighter sentence if they had eaten more recently.[13] In addition to cases like this, it has been proven that individuals smell better to someone with complementary immunity genes, leading to more physical attraction.[14] Genetics can be examined to determine if an individual is predisposed to any diseases, and behavioral disorders can most often be explained by analyzing defects in genetic code. Scientist who focus on examples like these argue that human behavior is entirely predictable. Those on the other side of the debate argue that genetics can only provide a predisposition to act a certain way and that, ultimately, humans possess the free will to choose whether or not to act.
As climate change and other weather phenomenon become more common, the predictability of climate systems becomes more important. The IPCC notes that our ability to predict future detailed climate interactions is difficult, however, long term climate forecasts are possible.[17][18]

Linguistic prediction is a phenomenon in psycholinguistics occurring whenever information about a word or other linguistic unit is activated before that unit is actually encountered. Evidence from eyetracking, event-related potentials, and other experimental methods indicates that in addition to integrating each subsequent word into the context formed by previously encountered words, language users may, under certain conditions, try to predict upcoming words. Predictability has been shown to affect both text and speech processing, as well as speech production. Further, predictability has been shown to have an effect on syntactic, semantic and pragmatic comprehension.

In the study of biology – particularly genetics and neuroscience – predictability relates to the prediction of biological developments and behaviors based on inherited genes and past experiences.
The study of predictability often sparks debate between those who believe humans maintain complete control over their free-will and those who believe our actions are predetermined. However, it is likely that neither Newton nor Laplace saw the study of predictability as relating to determinism.[16]

In experimental physics, there are always observational errors determining variables such as positions and velocities. So perfect prediction is practically impossible. Moreover, in modern quantum mechanics, Werner Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle puts limits on the accuracy with which such quantities can be known. So such perfect predictability is also theoretically impossible.

The spring predictability barrier refers to a period of time early in the year when making summer weather predictions about the El Niño–Southern Oscillation is difficult. It is unknown why it is difficult, although many theories have been proposed. There is some thought that the cause is due to the ENSO transition where conditions are more rapidly shifting.[24]

Another example of human-computer interaction are computer simulations meant to predict human behavior based on algorithms. For example, MIT has recently developed an incredibly accurate algorithm to predict the behavior of humans. When tested against television shows, the algorithm was able to predict with great accuracy the subsequent actions of characters. Algorithms and computer simulations like these show great promise for the future of artificial intelligence.[12]

Although the second law of thermodynamics can determine the equilibrium state that a system will evolve to, and steady states in dissipative systems can sometimes be predicted, there exists no general rule to predict the time evolution of systems distanced from equilibrium, e.g. chaotic systems, if they do not approach an equilibrium state.Their predictability usually deteriorates with time and to quantify predictability, the rate of divergence of system trajectories in phase space can be measured (Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy, Lyapunov exponents).

As documented in,[3] three major kinds of butterfly effects within Lorenz studies include: the sensitive dependence on initial conditions,[4][5] the ability of a tiny perturbation to create an organized circulation at large distances,[6] and the hypothetical role of small-scale processes in contributing to finite predictability.[7][8][9] The three kinds of butterfly effects are not exactly the same.
Laplace's demon is a supreme intelligence who could completely predict the one possible future given the Newtonian dynamical laws of classical physics and perfect knowledge of the positions and velocities of all the particles in the world. In other words, if it were possible to have every piece of data on every atom in the universe from the beginning of time, it would be possible to predict the behavior of every atom into the future. Laplace's determinism is usually thought to be based on his mechanics, but he could not prove mathematically that mechanics is deterministic. Rather, his determinism is based on general philosophical principles, specifically on the principle of sufficient reason and the law of continuity.[1]

The branch of mathematics known as Chaos Theory focuses on the behavior of systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. It suggests that a small change in an initial condition can completely alter the progression of a system. This phenomenon is known as the butterfly effect, which claims that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas. The nature of chaos theory suggests that the predictability of any system is limited because it is impossible to know all of the minutiae of a system at the present time. In principal, the deterministic systems that chaos theory attempts to analyze can be predicted, but uncertainty in a forecast increases exponentially with elapsed time.[2]

Causal determinism has a strong relationship with predictability. Perfect predictability implies strict determinism, but lack of predictability does not necessarily imply lack of determinism. Limitations on predictability could be caused by factors such as a lack of information or excessive complexity.

"The predictability of a flow which possesses many scales of motion"
Predictability in macroeconomics refers most frequently to the degree to which an economic model accurately reflects quarterly data and the degree to which one might successfully identify the internal propagation mechanisms of models. Examples of US macroeconomic series of interest include but are not limited to Consumption, Investment, Real GNP, and Capital Stock. Factors that are involved in the predictability of an economic system include the range of the forecast (is the forecast two years "out" or twenty) and the variability of estimates. Mathematical processes for assessing the predictability of macroeconomic trends are still in development.[25]

"Is Weather Chaotic? Coexisting Chaotic and Non-chaotic Attractors Within Lorenz Models"
Over 50 years since Lorenz’s 1963 study and a follow-up presentation in 1972, the statement “weather is chaotic” has been well accepted. [4][5] Such a view turns our attention from regularity associated with Laplace’s view of determinism to irregularity associated with chaos. In contrast to single-type chaotic solutions, recent studies using a generalized Lorenz model[19] have focused on the coexistence of chaotic and regular solutions that appear within the same model using the same modeling configurations but different initial conditions.[20][21] The results, with attractor coexistence, suggest that the entirety of weather possesses a dual nature of chaos and order with distinct predictability.[22]

Stochastic calculus is a branch of mathematics that operates on stochastic processes. It allows a consistent theory of integration to be defined for integrals of stochastic processes with respect to stochastic processes. This field was created and started by the Japanese mathematician Kiyoshi Itô during World War II.

The Stratonovich integral of a semimartingale X{\displaystyle X} against another semimartingale Y can be defined in terms of the Itô integral as
where [X, Y]tc denotes the quadratic covariation of the continuous parts of Xand Y. The alternative notation
The main flavours of stochastic calculus are the Itô calculus and its variational relative the Malliavin calculus.For technical reasons the Itô integral is the most useful for general classes of processes, but the related Stratonovich integral is frequently useful in problem formulation (particularly in engineering disciplines). The Stratonovich integral can readily be expressed in terms of the Itô integral.The main benefit of the Stratonovich integral is that it obeys the usual chain rule and therefore does not require Itô's lemma. This enables problems to be expressed in a coordinate system invariant form, which is invaluable when developing stochastic calculus on manifolds other than Rn.The dominated convergence theorem does not hold for the Stratonovich integral; consequently it is very difficult to prove results without re-expressing the integrals in Itô form.

An important application of stochastic calculus is in mathematical finance, in which asset prices are often assumed to follow stochastic differential equations. For example, the Black–Scholes model prices options as if they follow a geometric Brownian motion, illustrating the opportunities and risks from applying stochastic calculus.

The Itô integral is central to the study of stochastic calculus. The integral ∫HdX{\displaystyle \int H\,dX} is defined for a semimartingale X and locally bounded predictable process H.[citation needed]
The best-known stochastic process to which stochastic calculus is applied is the Wiener process (named in honor of Norbert Wiener), which is used for modeling Brownian motion as described by Louis Bachelier in 1900 and by Albert Einstein in 1905 and other physical diffusion processes in space of particles subject to random forces.Since the 1970s, the Wiener process has been widely applied in financial mathematics and economics to model the evolution in time of stock prices and bond interest rates.

The choice of σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebras in the definition above is sometimes implicit and left up to the context. For example, for R,{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,} C,{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ,} or other topological spaces, the Borel algebra (generated by all the open sets) is a common choice. Some authors define measurable functions as exclusively real-valued ones with respect to the Borel algebra.[1]
The (pointwise) supremum, infimum, limit superior, and limit inferior of a sequence (viz., countably many) of real-valued measurable functions are all measurable as well.[1][4]

Real-valued functions encountered in applications tend to be measurable; however, it is not difficult to prove the existence of non-measurable functions.Such proofs rely on the axiom of choice in an essential way, in the sense that Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice does not prove the existence of such functions.
If the values of the function lie in an infinite-dimensional vector space, other non-equivalent definitions of measurability, such as weak measurability and Bochner measurability, exist.
As another example, any non-constant function f:X→R{\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {R} } is non-measurable with respect to the trivial σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebra Σ={∅,X},{\displaystyle \Sigma =\{\varnothing ,X\},} since the preimage of any point in the range is some proper, nonempty subset of X,{\displaystyle X,} which is not an element of the trivial Σ.{\displaystyle \Sigma .}

A Lebesgue measurable function is a measurable function f:(R,L)→(C,BC),{\displaystyle f:(\mathbb {R} ,{\mathcal {L}})\to (\mathbb {C} ,{\mathcal {B}}_{\mathbb {C} }),} where L{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} is the σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets, and BC{\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{\mathbb {C} }} is the Borel algebra on the complex numbers C.{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} .}Lebesgue measurable functions are of interest in mathematical analysis because they can be integrated. In the case f:X→R,{\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {R} ,} f{\displaystyle f} is Lebesgue measurable if and only if {f>α}={x∈X:f(x)>α}{\displaystyle \{f>\alpha \}=\{x\in X:f(x)>\alpha \}} is measurable for all α∈R.{\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {R} .} This is also equivalent to any of {f≥α},{f<α},{f≤α}{\displaystyle \{f\geq \alpha \},\{f<\alpha \},\{f\leq \alpha \}} being measurable for all α,{\displaystyle \alpha ,} or the preimage of any open set being measurable. Continuous functions, monotone functions, step functions, semicontinuous functions, Riemann-integrable functions, and functions of bounded variation are all Lebesgue measurable.[2] A function f:X→C{\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {C} } is measurable if and only if the real and imaginary parts are measurable.

In mathematics and in particular measure theory, a measurable function is a function between the underlying sets of two measurable spaces that preserves the structure of the spaces: the preimage of any measurable set is measurable. This is in direct analogy to the definition that a continuous function between topological spaces preserves the topological structure: the preimage of any open set is open. In real analysis, measurable functions are used in the definition of the Lebesgue integral. In probability theory, a measurable function on a probability space is known as a random variable.
If f:(X,Σ1)→(Y,Σ2){\displaystyle f:(X,\Sigma _{1})\to (Y,\Sigma _{2})} and g:(Y,Σ3)→(Z,Σ4){\displaystyle g:(Y,\Sigma _{3})\to (Z,\Sigma _{4})} are measurable functions, their composition g∘f:X→Z{\displaystyle g\circ f:X\to Z} need not be (Σ1,Σ4){\displaystyle (\Sigma _{1},\Sigma _{4})}-measurable unless Σ3⊆Σ2.{\displaystyle \Sigma _{3}\subseteq \Sigma _{2}.} Indeed, two Lebesgue-measurable functions may be constructed in such a way as to make their composition non-Lebesgue-measurable.
If (X,Σ){\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} and (Y,T){\displaystyle (Y,T)} are Borel spaces, a measurable function f:(X,Σ)→(Y,T){\displaystyle f:(X,\Sigma )\to (Y,T)}is also called a Borel function. Continuous functions are Borel functions but not all Borel functions are continuous. However, a measurable function is nearly a continuous function; see Luzin's theorem.If a Borel function happens to be a section of a map Y→ π X,{\displaystyle Y\xrightarrow {~\pi ~} X,} it is called a Borel section.

Probability theory is required to describe quantum phenomena.[34] A revolutionary discovery of early 20th century physics was the random character of all physical processes that occur at sub-atomic scales and are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The objective wave function evolves deterministically but, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, it deals with probabilities of observing, the outcome being explained by a wave function collapse when an observation is made. However, the loss of determinism for the sake of instrumentalism did not meet with universal approval. Albert Einstein famously remarked in a letter to Max Born: "I am convinced that God does not play dice".[35] Like Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, who discovered the wave function, believed quantum mechanics is a statistical approximation of an underlying deterministic reality.[36] In some modern interpretations of the statistical mechanics of measurement, quantum decoherence is invoked to account for the appearance of subjectively probabilistic experimental outcomes.

According to Richard Jeffrey, "Before the middle of the seventeenth century, the term 'probable' (Latin probabilis) meant approvable, and was applied in that sense, univocally, to opinion and to action. A probable action or opinion was one such as sensible people would undertake or hold, in the circumstances."[12] However, in legal contexts especially, 'probable' could also apply to propositions for which there was good evidence.[13]

There have been at least two successful attempts to formalize probability, namely the Kolmogorov formulation and the Cox formulation. In Kolmogorov's formulation (see also probability space), sets are interpreted as events and probability as a measure on a class of sets. In Cox's theorem, probability is taken as a primitive (i.e., not further analyzed), and the emphasis is on constructing a consistent assignment of probability values to propositions. In both cases, the laws of probability are the same, except for technical details.
The scientific study of probability is a modern development of mathematics. Gambling shows that there has been an interest in quantifying the ideas of probability for millennia, but exact mathematical descriptions arose much later. There are reasons for the slow development of the mathematics of probability. Whereas games of chance provided the impetus for the mathematical study of probability, fundamental issues [note 2] are still obscured by the superstitions of gamblers.[11]

The theory of errors may be traced back to Roger Cotes's Opera Miscellanea (posthumous, 1722), but a memoir prepared by Thomas Simpson in 1755 (printed 1756) first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation.[18] The reprint (1757) of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable, and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors. Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve.

In the nineteenth century, authors on the general theory included Laplace, Sylvestre Lacroix (1816), Littrow (1833), Adolphe Quetelet (1853), Richard Dedekind (1860), Helmert (1872), Hermann Laurent (1873), Liagre, Didion and Karl Pearson.

If either event A or event B can occur but never both simultaneously, then they are called mutually exclusive events.

The converse is not necessarily true. Strictly speaking, a probability of 0 indicates that an event almost never takes place, whereas a probability of 1 indicates than an event almost certainly takes place. This is an important distinction when the sample space is infinite. For example, for the continuous uniform distribution on the real interval [5, 10], there are an infinite number of possible outcomes, and the probability of any given outcome being observed — for instance, exactly 7 — is 0. This means that when we make an observation, it will almost surely not be exactly 7. However, it does not mean that exactly 7 is impossible. Ultimately some specific outcome (with probability 0) will be observed, and one possibility for that specific outcome is exactly 7.

In science, the probability of an event is a number that indicates how likely the event is to occur. It is expressed as a number in the range from 0 and 1, or, using percentage notation, in the range from 0% to 100%.The more likely it is that the event will occur, the higher its probability. The probability of an impossible event is 0; that of an event that is certain to occur is 1.[note 1][1][2] The probabilities of two complementary events A and B – either A occurs or B occurs – add up to 1. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. If a coin is fair, the two possible outcomes ("heads" and "tails") are equally likely; since these two outcomes are complementary and the probability of "heads" equals the probability of "tails", the probability of each of the two outcomes equals 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).
Daniel Bernoulli (1778) introduced the principle of the maximum product of the probabilities of a system of concurrent errors.
In addition to financial assessment, probability can be used to analyze trends in biology (e.g., disease spread) as well as ecology (e.g., biological Punnett squares). As with finance, risk assessment can be used as a statistical tool to calculate the likelihood of undesirable events occurring, and can assist with implementing protocols to avoid encountering such circumstances. Probability is used to design games of chance so that casinos can make a guaranteed profit, yet provide payouts to players that are frequent enough to encourage continued play.[25]

Probability theory is applied in everyday life in risk assessment and modeling. The insurance industry and markets use actuarial science to determine pricing and make trading decisions. Governments apply probabilistic methods in environmental regulation, entitlement analysis, and financial regulation.
When dealing with experiments that are random and well-defined in a purely theoretical setting (like tossing a coin), probabilities can be numerically described by the number of desired outcomes, divided by the total number of all outcomes. For example, tossing a coin twice will yield "head-head", "head-tail", "tail-head", and "tail-tail" outcomes. The probability of getting an outcome of "head-head" is 1 out of 4 outcomes, or, in numerical terms, 1/4, 0.25 or 25%. However, when it comes to practical application, there are two major competing categories of probability interpretations, whose adherents hold different views about the fundamental nature of probability:
An example of the use of probability theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's prices up or down, and signals other traders of that opinion. Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.[24]

These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory, a branch of mathematics that is used in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science and game theory to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems.[3]

He gave two proofs, the second being essentially the same as John Herschel's (1850).[citation needed] Gauss gave the first proof that seems to have been known in Europe (the third after Adrain's) in 1809. Further proofs were given by Laplace (1810, 1812), Gauss (1823), James Ivory (1825, 1826), Hagen (1837), Friedrich Bessel (1838), W.F. Donkin (1844, 1856), and Morgan Crofton (1870). Other contributors were Ellis (1844), De Morgan (1864), Glaisher (1872), and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1875).

Subjectivists assign numbers per subjective probability, that is, as a degree of belief.[5] The degree of belief has been interpreted as "the price at which you would buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if E, 0 if not E",[6] although that interpretation is not universally agreed upon.[7]The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability, which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities.The expert knowledge is represented by some (subjective) prior probability distribution.These data are incorporated in a likelihood function. The product of the prior and the likelihood, when normalized, results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date.[8] By Aumann's agreement theorem, Bayesian agents whose prior beliefs are similar will end up with similar posterior beliefs. However, sufficiently different priors can lead to different conclusions, regardless of how much information the agents share.[9]

Like other theories, the theory of probability is a representation of its concepts in formal terms—that is, in terms that can be considered separately from their meaning. These formal terms are manipulated by the rules of mathematics and logic, and any results are interpreted or translated back into the problem domain.

The word probability derives from the Latin probabilitascode: lat promoted to code: la , which can also mean "probity", a measure of the authority of a witness in a legal case in Europe, and often correlated with the witness's nobility. In a sense, this differs much from the modern meaning of probability, which in contrast is a measure of the weight of empirical evidence, and is arrived at from inductive reasoning and statistical inference.[10]

A probability is a way of assigning every event a value between zero and one, with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results (in our example, the event {1,2,3,4,5,6}) is assigned a value of one. To qualify as a probability, the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement that for any collection of mutually exclusive events (events with no common results, such as the events {1,6}, {3}, and {2,4}), the probability that at least one of the events will occur is given by the sum of the probabilities of all the individual events.[27]

The sixteenth-century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes[14]).Aside from the elementary work by Cardano, the doctrine of probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal (1654). Christiaan Huygens (1657) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject.[15] Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi (posthumous, 1713) and Abraham de Moivre's Doctrine of Chances (1718) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics.[16] See Ian Hacking's The Emergence of Probability[10] and James Franklin's The Science of Conjecture[17] for histories of the early development of the very concept of mathematical probability.

In a deterministic universe, based on Newtonian concepts, there would be no probability if all conditions were known (Laplace's demon) (but there are situations in which sensitivity to initial conditions exceeds our ability to measure them, i.e. know them).In the case of a roulette wheel, if the force of the hand and the period of that force are known, the number on which the ball will stop would be a certainty (though as a practical matter, this would likely be true only of a roulette wheel that had not been exactly levelled – as Thomas A. Bass' Newtonian Casino revealed).This also assumes knowledge of inertia and friction of the wheel, weight, smoothness, and roundness of the ball, variations in hand speed during the turning, and so forth. A probabilistic description can thus be more useful than Newtonian mechanics for analyzing the pattern of outcomes of repeated rolls of a roulette wheel. Physicists face the same situation in the kinetic theory of gases, where the system, while deterministic in principle, is so complex (with the number of molecules typically the order of magnitude of the Avogadro constant 6.02×1023) that only a statistical description of its properties is feasible.

In probability theory and applications, Bayes' rule relates the odds of event A1{\displaystyle A_{1}} to event A2,{\displaystyle A_{2},} before (prior to) and after (posterior to) conditioning on another event B.{\displaystyle B.} The odds on A1{\displaystyle A_{1}} to event A2{\displaystyle A_{2}} is simply the ratio of the probabilities of the two events. When arbitrarily many events A{\displaystyle A} are of interest, not just two, the rule can be rephrased as posterior is proportional to prior times likelihood, P(A|B)∝P(A)P(B|A){\displaystyle P(A|B)\propto P(A)P(B|A)} where the proportionality symbol means that the left hand side is proportional to (i.e., equals a constant times) the right hand side as A{\displaystyle A} varies, for fixed or given B{\displaystyle B} (Lee, 2012; Bertsch McGrayne, 2012).

There are other methods for quantifying uncertainty, such as the Dempster–Shafer theory or possibility theory, but those are essentially different and not compatible with the usually-understood laws of probability.
Objectivists assign numbers to describe some objective or physical state of affairs. The most popular version of objective probability is frequentist probability, which claims that the probability of a random event denotes the relative frequency of occurrence of an experiment's outcome when the experiment is repeated indefinitely. This interpretation considers probability to be the relative frequency "in the long run" of outcomes.[4] A modification of this is propensity probability, which interprets probability as the tendency of some experiment to yield a certain outcome, even if it is performed only once.

Consider an experiment that can produce a number of results. The collection of all possible results is called the sample space of the experiment, sometimes denoted as Ω{\displaystyle \Omega }. The power set of the sample space is formed by considering all different collections of possible results. For example, rolling a die can produce six possible results. One collection of possible results gives an odd number on the die. Thus, the subset {1,3,5} is an element of the power set of the sample space of dice rolls. These collections are called "events". In this case, {1,3,5} is the event that the die falls on some odd number. If the results that actually occur fall in a given event, the event is said to have occurred.

The first two laws of error that were proposed both originated with Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first law was published in 1774, and stated that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of the numerical magnitude of the error—disregarding sign. The second law of error was proposed in 1778 by Laplace, and stated that the frequency of the error is an exponential function of the square of the error.[19] The second law of error is called the normal distribution or the Gauss law. "It is difficult historically to attribute that law to Gauss, who in spite of his well-known precocity had probably not made this discovery before he was two years old."[19]
Another significant application of probability theory in everyday life is reliability. Many consumer products, such as automobiles and consumer electronics, use reliability theory in product design to reduce the probability of failure. Failure probability may influence a manufacturer's decisions on a product's warranty.[26]

The process X{\displaystyle X} is said to be adapted to the filtration (Fi)i∈I{\displaystyle \left({\mathcal {F}}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} if the random variable Xi:Ω→S{\displaystyle X_{i}:\Omega \to S} is a (Fi,Σ){\displaystyle ({\mathcal {F}}_{i},\Sigma )}-measurable function for each i∈I{\displaystyle i\in I}.[2]

(S,Σ){\displaystyle (S,\Sigma )} be a measurable space, the state space;
If we take the natural filtration F•X, where FtX is the σ-algebra generated by the pre-images Xs−1(B) for Borel subsets B of R and times 0 ≤ s ≤ t, then X is automatically F•X-adapted. Intuitively, the natural filtration F•X contains "total information" about the behaviour of X up to time t.
F=(Fi)i∈I{\displaystyle \mathbb {F} =\left({\mathcal {F}}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} be a filtration of the sigma algebra F{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}};
This offers a simple example of a non-adapted process X : [0, 2] × Ω → R: set Ft to be the trivial σ-algebra {∅, Ω} for times 0 ≤ t < 1, and Ft = FtX for times 1 ≤ t ≤ 2. Since the only way that a function can be measurable with respect to the trivial σ-algebra is to be constant, any process X that is non-constant on [0, 1] will fail to be F•-adapted. The non-constant nature of such a process "uses information" from the more refined "future" σ-algebras Ft, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2.

In the study of stochastic processes, an adapted process (also referred to as a non-anticipating or non-anticipative process) is one that cannot "see into the future". An informal interpretation[1] is that X is adapted if and only if, for every realisation and every n, Xn is known at time n. The concept of an adapted process is essential, for instance, in the definition of the Itō integral, which only makes sense if the integrand is an adapted process.

One would like to assign a size to every subset of X,{\displaystyle X,} but in many natural settings, this is not possible. For example, the axiom of choice implies that when the size under consideration is the ordinary notion of length for subsets of the real line, then there exist sets for which no size exists, for example, the Vitali sets. For this reason, one considers instead a smaller collection of privileged subsets of X.{\displaystyle X.} These subsets will be called the measurable sets. They are closed under operations that one would expect for measurable sets, that is, the complement of a measurable set is a measurable set and the countable union of measurable sets is a measurable set.Non-empty collections of sets with these properties are called σ-algebras.
A function f{\displaystyle f} from a set X{\displaystyle X} to a set Y{\displaystyle Y} is measurable with respect to a σ-algebra Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } of subsets of X{\displaystyle X} if and only if σ(f){\displaystyle \sigma (f)} is a subset of Σ.{\displaystyle \Sigma .}

A measure on X{\displaystyle X} is a function that assigns a non-negative real number to subsets of X;{\displaystyle X;} this can be thought of as making precise a notion of "size" or "volume" for sets. We want the size of the union of disjoint sets to be the sum of their individual sizes, even for an infinite sequence of disjoint sets.

An important example is the Borel algebra over any topological space: the σ-algebra generated by the open sets (or, equivalently, by the closed sets). Note that this σ-algebra is not, in general, the whole power set. For a non-trivial example that is not a Borel set, see the Vitali set or Non-Borel sets.
If f{\displaystyle f} is a function from a set X{\displaystyle X} to a set Y{\displaystyle Y} and B{\displaystyle B} is a σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebra of subsets of Y,{\displaystyle Y,} then the σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebra generated by the function f,{\displaystyle f,} denoted by σ(f),{\displaystyle \sigma (f),} is the collection of all inverse images f−1(S){\displaystyle f^{-1}(S)} of the sets S{\displaystyle S} in B.{\displaystyle B.} That is,
The σ-algebras are a subset of the set algebras; elements of the latter only need to be closed under the union or intersection of finitely many subsets, which is a weaker condition.[1]
The intersection of a collection of σ-algebras is a σ-algebra. To emphasize its character as a σ-algebra, it often is denoted by:

A Dynkin system (or λ-system) D{\displaystyle D} is a collection of subsets of X{\displaystyle X} that contains X{\displaystyle X} and is closed under complement and under countable unions of disjoint subsets.
In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, a σ-algebra (also σ-field) on a set X is a nonempty collection Σ of subsets of X closed under complement, countable unions, and countable intersections. The pair (X,Σ){\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is called a measurable space.
A σ-algebra is both a π-system and a Dynkin system (λ-system). The converse is true as well, by Dynkin's theorem (below).
The Borel σ-algebra for Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is generated by half-infinite rectangles and by finite rectangles. For example,

If X={a,b,c,d}{\displaystyle X=\{a,b,c,d\}} one possible σ-algebra on X{\displaystyle X} is Σ={∅,{a,b},{c,d},{a,b,c,d}},{\displaystyle \Sigma =\{\varnothing ,\{a,b\},\{c,d\},\{a,b,c,d\}\},} where ∅{\displaystyle \varnothing } is the empty set. In general, a finite algebra is always a σ-algebra.
From these properties, it follows that the σ-algebra is also closed under countable intersections (by applying De Morgan's laws).

The main use of σ-algebras is in the definition of measures; specifically, the collection of those subsets for which a given measure is defined is necessarily a σ-algebra. This concept is important in mathematical analysis as the foundation for Lebesgue integration, and in probability theory, where it is interpreted as the collection of events which can be assigned probabilities. Also, in probability, σ-algebras are pivotal in the definition of conditional expectation.
There are at least three key motivators for σ-algebras: defining measures, manipulating limits of sets, and managing partial information characterized by sets.

In statistics, (sub) σ-algebras are needed for the formal mathematical definition of a sufficient statistic,[2] particularly when the statistic is a function or a random process and the notion of conditional density is not applicable.
If {A1,A2,A3,…},{\displaystyle \{A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},\ldots \},} is a countable partition of X{\displaystyle X} then the collection of all unions of sets in the partition (including the empty set) is a σ-algebra.

A separable measure space has a natural pseudometric that renders it separable as a pseudometric space.The distance between two sets is defined as the measure of the symmetric difference of the two sets.Note that the symmetric difference of two distinct sets can have measure zero; hence the pseudometric as defined above need not to be a true metric.However, if sets whose symmetric difference has measure zero are identified into a single equivalence class, the resulting quotient set can be properly metrized by the induced metric.If the measure space is separable, it can be shown that the corresponding metric space is, too.

On the Euclidean space Rn,{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} another σ-algebra is of importance: that of all Lebesgue measurable sets. This σ-algebra contains more sets than the Borel σ-algebra on Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and is preferred in integration theory, as it gives a complete measure space.
For each of these two examples, the generating family is a π-system.
This theorem (or the related monotone class theorem) is an essential tool for proving many results about properties of specific σ-algebras. It capitalizes on the nature of two simpler classes of sets, namely the following.
The limit infimum or inner limit of a sequence A1,A2,A3,…{\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},\ldots } of subsets of X{\displaystyle X} is lim infn→∞An=⋃n=1∞⋂m=n∞Am=⋃n=1∞An∩An+1∩⋯.{\displaystyle \liminf _{n\to \infty }A_{n}=\bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty }\bigcap _{m=n}^{\infty }A_{m}=\bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}\cap A_{n+1}\cap \cdots .} It consists of all points that are in all but finitely many of these sets (or equivalently, that are eventually in all of them). That is, x∈lim infn→∞An{\displaystyle x\in \liminf _{n\to \infty }A_{n}} if and only if there exists an index N∈N{\displaystyle N\in \mathbb {N} } such that AN,AN+1,…{\displaystyle A_{N},A_{N+1},\ldots } all contain x;{\displaystyle x;} that is, such that x∈AN∩AN+1∩⋯.{\displaystyle x\in A_{N}\cap A_{N+1}\cap \cdots .}
Let X{\displaystyle X} be some set, and let P(X){\displaystyle P(X)} represent its power set. Then a subset Σ⊆P(X){\displaystyle \Sigma \subseteq P(X)} is called a σ-algebra if it satisfies the following three properties:[3]
An important special case is when T{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} } is the set of natural numbers and X{\displaystyle X} is a set of real-valued sequences. In this case, it suffices to consider the cylinder sets

One of the most fundamental uses of the π-λ theorem is to show equivalence of separately defined measures or integrals. For example, it is used to equate a probability for a random variable X{\displaystyle X} with the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral typically associated with computing the probability:

The inner limit is always a subset of the outer limit:
Suppose Y{\displaystyle Y} is a subset of X{\displaystyle X} and let (X,Σ){\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} be a measurable space.
Elements of the σ-algebra are called measurable sets. An ordered pair (X,Σ),{\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ),} where X{\displaystyle X} is a set and Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } is a σ-algebra over X,{\displaystyle X,} is called a measurable space. A function between two measurable spaces is called a measurable function if the preimage of every measurable set is measurable. The collection of measurable spaces forms a category, with the measurable functions as morphisms. Measures are defined as certain types of functions from a σ-algebra to [0,∞].{\displaystyle [0,\infty ].}
There are many families of subsets that generate useful σ-algebras. Some of these are presented here.
It also follows that the empty set ∅{\displaystyle \varnothing } is in Σ,{\displaystyle \Sigma ,} since by (1) X{\displaystyle X} is in Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } and (2) asserts that its complement, the empty set, is also in Σ.{\displaystyle \Sigma .}Moreover, since {X,∅}{\displaystyle \{X,\varnothing \}} satisfies condition (3) as well, it follows that {X,∅}{\displaystyle \{X,\varnothing \}} is the smallest possible σ-algebra on X.{\displaystyle X.}The largest possible σ-algebra on X{\displaystyle X} is ℘(X).{\displaystyle \wp (X).}

Many uses of measure, such as the probability concept of almost sure convergence, involve limits of sequences of sets. For this, closure under countable unions and intersections is paramount. Set limits are defined as follows on σ-algebras.
Sketch of Proof: Let Σ∗{\displaystyle \Sigma ^{*}} denote the intersection. Since X{\displaystyle X} is in every Σα,Σ∗{\displaystyle \Sigma _{\alpha },\Sigma ^{*}} is not empty. Closure under complement and countable unions for every Σα{\displaystyle \Sigma _{\alpha }} implies the same must be true for Σ∗.{\displaystyle \Sigma ^{*}.} Therefore, Σ∗{\displaystyle \Sigma ^{*}} is a σ-algebra.
A useful property is the following. Assume f{\displaystyle f} is a measurable map from (X,ΣX){\displaystyle \left(X,\Sigma _{X}\right)} to (S,ΣS){\displaystyle \left(S,\Sigma _{S}\right)} and g{\displaystyle g} is a measurable map from (X,ΣX){\displaystyle \left(X,\Sigma _{X}\right)} to (T,ΣT).{\displaystyle \left(T,\Sigma _{T}\right).} If there exists a measurable map h{\displaystyle h} from (T,ΣT){\displaystyle \left(T,\Sigma _{T}\right)} to (S,ΣS){\displaystyle \left(S,\Sigma _{S}\right)} such that f(x)=h(g(x)){\displaystyle f(x)=h(g(x))} for all x,{\displaystyle x,} then σ(f)⊆σ(g).{\displaystyle \sigma (f)\subseteq \sigma (g).} If S{\displaystyle S} is finite or countably infinite or, more generally, (S,ΣS){\displaystyle \left(S,\Sigma _{S}\right)} is a standard Borel space (for example, a separable complete metric space with its associated Borel sets), then the converse is also true.[7] Examples of standard Borel spaces include Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} with its Borel sets and R∞{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\infty }} with the cylinder σ-algebra described below.
For a simple example, consider the set X={1,2,3}.{\displaystyle X=\{1,2,3\}.} Then the σ-algebra generated by the single subset {1}{\displaystyle \{1\}} is σ({1})={∅,{1},{2,3},{1,2,3}}.{\displaystyle \sigma (\{1\})=\{\varnothing ,\{1\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}\}.} By an abuse of notation, when a collection of subsets contains only one element, A,{\displaystyle A,} σ(A){\displaystyle \sigma (A)} may be written instead of σ({A});{\displaystyle \sigma (\{A\});} in the prior example σ({1}){\displaystyle \sigma (\{1\})} instead of σ({{1}}).{\displaystyle \sigma (\{\{1\}\}).} Indeed, using σ(A1,A2,…){\displaystyle \sigma \left(A_{1},A_{2},\ldots \right)} to mean σ({A1,A2,…}){\displaystyle \sigma \left(\left\{A_{1},A_{2},\ldots \right\}\right)} is also quite common.

Imagine you and another person are betting on a game that involves flipping a coin repeatedly and observing whether it comes up Heads (H{\displaystyle H}) or Tails (T{\displaystyle T}). Since you and your opponent are each infinitely wealthy, there is no limit to how long the game can last. This means the sample space Ω must consist of all possible infinite sequences of H{\displaystyle H} or T:{\displaystyle T:}
The collection of subsets of X{\displaystyle X} which are countable or whose complements are countable is a σ-algebra (which is distinct from the power set of X{\displaystyle X} if and only if X{\displaystyle X} is uncountable). This is the σ-algebra generated by the singletons of X.{\displaystyle X.} Note: "countable" includes finite or empty.

A σ-algebra Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } is just a σ-ring that contains the universal set X.{\displaystyle X.}[4] A σ-ring need not be a σ-algebra, as for example measurable subsets of zero Lebesgue measure in the real line are a σ-ring, but not a σ-algebra since the real line has infinite measure and thus cannot be obtained by their countable union. If, instead of zero measure, one takes measurable subsets of finite Lebesgue measure, those are a ring but not a σ-ring, since the real line can be obtained by their countable union yet its measure is not finite.
The union of a collection of σ-algebras is not generally a σ-algebra, or even an algebra, but it generates a σ-algebra known as the join which typically is denoted
A more useful example is the set of subsets of the real line formed by starting with all open intervals and adding in all countable unions, countable intersections, and relative complements and continuing this process (by transfinite iteration through all countable ordinals) until the relevant closure properties are achieved (a construction known as the Borel hierarchy).

X{\displaystyle X} is in Σ,{\displaystyle \Sigma ,} and X{\displaystyle X} is considered to be the universal set in the following context.
A separable σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebra (or separable σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-field) is a σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebra F{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} that is a separable space when considered as a metric space with metric ρ(A,B)=μ(A△B){\displaystyle \rho (A,B)=\mu (A{\mathbin {\triangle }}B)} for A,B∈F{\displaystyle A,B\in {\mathcal {F}}} and a given measure μ{\displaystyle \mu } (and with △{\displaystyle \triangle } being the symmetric difference operator).[5]Note that any σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebra generated by a countable collection of sets is separable, but the converse need not hold. For example, the Lebesgue σ{\displaystyle \sigma }-algebra is separable (since every Lebesgue measurable set is equivalent to some Borel set) but not countably generated (since its cardinality is higher than continuum).
If f{\displaystyle f} is a function from X{\displaystyle X} to Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} then σ(f){\displaystyle \sigma (f)} is generated by the family of subsets which are inverse images of intervals/rectangles in Rn:{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}:}

Let F{\displaystyle F} be an arbitrary family of subsets of X.{\displaystyle X.} Then there exists a unique smallest σ-algebra which contains every set in F{\displaystyle F} (even though F{\displaystyle F} may or may not itself be a σ-algebra). It is, in fact, the intersection of all σ-algebras containing F.{\displaystyle F.} (See intersections of σ-algebras above.) This σ-algebra is denoted σ(F){\displaystyle \sigma (F)} and is called the σ-algebra generated by F.{\displaystyle F.}

σ-algebras are sometimes denoted using calligraphic capital letters, or the Fraktur typeface. Thus (X,Σ){\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} may be denoted as (X,F){\displaystyle \scriptstyle (X,\,{\mathcal {F}})} or(X,F).{\displaystyle \scriptstyle (X,\,{\mathfrak {F}}).}

Dynkin's π-λ theorem says, if P{\displaystyle P} is a π-system and D{\displaystyle D} is a Dynkin system that contains P,{\displaystyle P,} then the σ-algebra σ(P){\displaystyle \sigma (P)} generated by P{\displaystyle P} is contained in D.{\displaystyle D.}Since certain π-systems are relatively simple classes, it may not be hard to verify that all sets in P{\displaystyle P} enjoy the property under consideration while, on the other hand, showing that the collection D{\displaystyle D} of all subsets with the property is a Dynkin system can also be straightforward. Dynkin's π-λ Theorem then implies that all sets in σ(P){\displaystyle \sigma (P)} enjoy the property, avoiding the task of checking it for an arbitrary set in σ(P).{\displaystyle \sigma (P).}
In much of probability, especially when conditional expectation is involved, one is concerned with sets that represent only part of all the possible information that can be observed. This partial information can be characterized with a smaller σ-algebra which is a subset of the principal σ-algebra; it consists of the collection of subsets relevant only to and determined only by the partial information. A simple example suffices to illustrate this idea.
Observe that {B1×B2:B1∈Σ1,B2∈Σ2}{\displaystyle \{B_{1}\times B_{2}:B_{1}\in \Sigma _{1},B_{2}\in \Sigma _{2}\}} is a π-system.

In economics, the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model is deterministic. The stochastic equivalent is known as real business-cycle theory.
A pseudorandom number generator is a deterministic algorithm, that is designed to produce sequences of numbers that behave as random sequences. A hardware random number generator, however, may be non-deterministic.

A deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states. There may be non-deterministic algorithms that run on a deterministic machine, for example, an algorithm that relies on random choices. Generally, for such random choices, one uses a pseudorandom number generator, but one may also use some external physical process, such as the last digits of the time given by the computer clock.

In mathematics, computer science and physics, a deterministic system is a system in which no randomness is involved in the development of future states of the system.[1] A deterministic model will thus always produce the same output from a given starting condition or initial state.[2]
The systems studied in chaos theory are deterministic. If the initial state were known exactly, then the future state of such a system could theoretically be predicted. However, in practice, knowledge about the future state is limited by the precision with which the initial state can be measured, and chaotic systems are characterized by a strong dependence on the initial conditions. This sensitivity to initial conditions can be measured with Lyapunov exponents.
A deterministic model of computation, for example a deterministic Turing machine, is a model of computation such that the successive states of the machine and the operations to be performed are completely determined by the preceding state.
Physical laws that are described by differential equations represent deterministic systems, even though the state of the system at a given point in time may be difficult to describe explicitly.
deterministic system - definition at The Internet Encyclopedia of Science
Markov chains and other random walks are not deterministic systems, because their development depends on random choices.
In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation, which describes the continuous time evolution of a system's wave function, is deterministic. However, the relationship between a system's wave function and the observable properties of the system appears to be non-deterministic.
