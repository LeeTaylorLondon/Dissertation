It's the first time I've seen one made from cat's-eye, so the owner shouldn't be hard to track down. I'd go and look for them myself, but I've got too much to do here.
Oh, yes. Cat's-eye charms like this were once used to ward off misfortune. The tradition began with the Church of the First Light and the gem represents their patron deity.
Even though no one follows that old religion anymore, some of its customs remain, especially among the miners.

^ "Almanac" in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (which has an extra "note as to the origin and history of the word almanac").
It has been suggested that the word almanac derives from a Greek word meaning calendar.[2]However, that word appears only once in antiquity, by Eusebius who quotes Porphyry as to the Coptic Egyptian use of astrological charts (almenichiaká). The earliest almanacs were calendars that included agricultural, astronomical, or meteorological data. But it is highly unlikely Roger Bacon received the word from this etymology: "Notwithstanding the suggestive sound and use of this word (of which however the real form is very uncertain), the difficulties of connecting it historically either with the Spanish Arabic manākh, or with Medieval Latin almanach without Arabic intermediation, seem insurmountable."[3]

Ptolemy believed that astronomical phenomena caused the changes in seasonal weather; his explanation of why there was not an exact correlation of these events was that the physical influences of other heavenly bodies also came into play. Hence for him, weather prediction was a special division of astrology.[14]

Major topics covered by almanacs (reflected by their tables of contents) include: geography, government, demographics, agriculture, economics and business, health and medicine, religion, mass media, transportation, science and technology, sport, and awards/prizes.
Samuel Stearns of Paxton, Massachusetts, issued the North-American Almanack, published annually from 1771 to 1784, as well as the first American nautical almanac, The Navigator's Kalendar, or Nautical Almanack, for 1783.[26] Andrew Ellicott of Ellicott's Upper Mills, Maryland, authored a series of almanacs, The United States Almanack, the earliest known copy of which bears the date of 1782.[27] Benjamin Banneker, a free African American living near Ellicott's Mills, composed a series of almanacs for the years of 1792 to 1797.[28]

The GPS almanac, as part of the data transmitted by each GPS satellite, contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the constellation, an ionospheric model, and information to relate GPS derived time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Hence the GPS almanac provides a similar goal as the ancient Babylonian almanac, to find celestial bodies.[31]

Nathaniel Ames of Dedham, Massachusetts, issued his popular Astronomical Diary and Almanack in 1725 and annually after c.1732.[23] James Franklin published The Rhode Island Almanack by "Poor Robin"for each year from 1728 to 1735.[24] James' brother, Benjamin Franklin, published his annual Poor Richard's Almanack in Philadelphia from 1732 to 1758.[25]
The etymology of the word is disputed. The earliest documented use of the word in any language is in Latin in 1267 by Roger Bacon, where it meant a set of tables detailing movements of heavenly bodies including the Moon.
Currently published almanacs such as Whitaker's Almanack have expanded their scope and contents beyond that of their historical counterparts. Modern almanacs include a comprehensive presentation of statistical and descriptive data covering the entire world. Contents also include discussions of topical developments and a summary of recent historical events. Other currently published almanacs (ca. 2006) include TIME Almanac with Information Please, World Almanac and Book of Facts, The Farmer's Almanac and The Old Farmer's Almanac and The Almanac for Farmers & City Folk. The Inverness Almanac, an almanac/literary journal, was published in West Marin, California, from 2015 to 2016.[29] In 2007, Harrowsmith Country Life Magazine launched a Canadian Almanac, written in Canada, with all-Canadian content. The nonprofit agrarian organization the Greenhorns currently publishes The New Farmer's Almanac as a resource for young farmers.[30]

The prestige of the Tables of Toledo and other medieval Arabic astronomy works at the time of the word's emergence in the West, together with the absence of the word in Arabic, suggest it may have been invented in the West and is pseudo-Arabic. At that time in the West, it would have been prestigious to attach an Arabic appellation to a set of astronomical tables. Also around that time, prompted by that motive, the Latin writer Pseudo-Geber wrote under an Arabic pseudonym. (The later alchemical word alkahest is known to be pseudo-Arabic.)

An almanac (also spelled almanack and almanach) is an annual publication listing a set of current information about one or multiple subjects.[1] It includes information like weather forecasts, farmers' planting dates, tide tables, and other tabular data often arranged according to the calendar. Celestial figures and various statistics are found in almanacs, such as the rising and setting times of the Sun and Moon, dates of eclipses, hours of high and low tides, and religious festivals. The set of events noted in an almanac may be tailored for a specific group of readers, such as farmers, sailors, or astronomers.

By the second half of the 16th century, yearly almanacs were being produced in England by authors such as Anthony Askham, Thomas Buckminster, John Dade and Gabriel Frende. In the 17th century, English almanacs were bestsellers, second only to the Bible; by the middle of the century, 400,000 almanacs were being produced annually (a complete listing can be found in the English Short Title Catalogue). Until its deregulation in 1775, the Stationers' Company maintained a lucrative monopoly over almanac publication in England.[18] Richard Allestree (not to be confused with Richard Allestree (1621/22–1681), provost of Eton College) wrote one of the more popular English almanacs, producing yearly volumes from 1617 to 1643, but his is by no means the earliest or the longest-running almanac.

Works that satirized this type of publication appeared in the late 1500s. During the next century, a writer using the pseudonym of "Poor Richard, Knight of the Burnt Island" began to publish a series of such parodies that were entitled Poor Robin's Almanack.The 1664 issue of the series stated: "This month we may expect to hear of the Death of some Man, Woman, or Child, either in Kent or Christendom."[19]

One etymology report says "The ultimate source of the word is obscure. Its first syllable, al-, and its general relevance to medieval science and technology, strongly suggest an Arabic origin, but no convincing candidate has been found".[4] Ernest Weekley similarly states of almanac: "First seen in Roger Bacon. Apparently from Spanish Arabic, al-manakh, but this is not an Arabic word....The word remains a puzzle."[5] Walter William Skeat concludes that the construction of an Arabic origin is "not satisfactory".[6]The Oxford English Dictionary similarly says "the word has no etymon in Arabic" but indirect circumstantial evidence "points to a Spanish Arabic al-manākh".[7]

The Greek almanac, known as parapegma, has existed in the form of an inscribed stone on which the days of the month were indicated by movable pegs inserted into bored holes, hence the name. There were also written texts and according to Diogenes Laërtius, Parapegma was the title of a book by Democritus.[13] Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer (2nd century) wrote a treatise, Phaseis—"phases of fixed stars and collection of weather-changes" is the translation of its full title—the core of which is a parapegma, a list of dates of seasonally regular weather changes, first appearances and last appearances of stars or constellations at sunrise or sunset, and solar events such as solstices, all organized according to the solar year. With the astronomical computations were expected weather phenomena, composed as a digest of observations made by various authorities of the past. Parapegmata had been composed for centuries.
"New Acquisition: First Masonic Almanac Published in the United States"
The earlier texts considered to be almanacs have been found in the Near East, dating back to the middle of the second millennium BC. They have been called generally hemerologies, from the Greek hēmerā, meaning "day". Among them is the so-called Babylonian Almanac, which lists favorable and unfavorable days with advice on what to do on each of them. Successive variants and versions aimed at different readership have been found.[9] Egyptian lists of good and bad moments, three times each day, have also been found. Many of these prognostics were connected with celestial events.[10][11][12] The flooding of the Nile valley, a most important event in ancient Egypt, was expected to occur at the summer solstice, but as the civil calendar had exactly 365 days, over the centuries,the date was drifting in the calendar.[note 1] The first heliacal rising of Sirius was used for its prediction and this practice, the observation of some star and its connecting to some event apparently spread.

The first almanac printed in the Thirteen Colonies of British America was William Pierce's 1639 An Almanac Calculated for New England. The almanac was the first in a series of such publications that Stephen Daye, or Day, printed each year until 1649 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[20] The Cambridge/Boston area in Massachusetts soon became the first center in the colonies for the annual publication of almanacs,[21] to be followed by Philadelphia during the first half of the eighteenth century.[22]
The origins of the almanac can be connected to ancient Babylonian astronomy, when tables of planetary periods were produced in order to predict lunar and planetary phenomena.[15] Similar treatises called Zij were later composed in medieval Islamic astronomy.
"Greenhorns - To Promote, Recruit and Support Young Farmers in America"
The modern almanac differs from Babylonian, Ptolemaic and Zij tables in the sense that "the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation", in contrast to the more common "auxiliary astronomical tables" based on Ptolemy's Almagest. The earliest known almanac in this modern sense is the Almanac of Azarqueil written in 1088 by Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī (Latinized as Arzachel) in Toledo, al-Andalus. The work provided the true daily positions of the sun, moon and planets for four years from 1088 to 1092, as well as many other related tables. A Latin translation and adaptation of the work appeared as the Tables of Toledo in the 12th century and the Alfonsine tables in the 13th century.[16]

The reason why the proposed Arabic word is speculatively spelled al-manākh is that the spelling occurred as "almanach", as well as almanac (and Roger Bacon used both spellings). The earliest use of the word was in the context of astronomy calendars. The Arabic word المناخ al-munākh has different meanings in contemporary Arabic than in classical Arabic usage. The word originally meant "the place where camels kneel [so riders and baggage can disembark]". In contemporary Arabic, the word means "climate".[8]
The new year coincides with the summer solstice once in 1441 years, which is known as the sothic period.

After almanacs were devised, people still saw little difference between predicting the movements of the stars and tides, and predicting the future in the divination sense. Early almanacs therefore contained general horoscopes, as well as natural information. In 1150 Solomon Jarchus created such an almanac considered to be among the first modern examples. Copies of 12th century almanacs are found in the British Museum, and in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In 1300, Petrus de Dacia created an almanac (Savilian Library, Oxford) the same year Roger Bacon, OFM, produced his own. In 1327 Walter de Elvendene created an almanac and later on John Somers of Oxford, in 1380. In 1386 Nicholas de Lynne, Oxford produced an almanac. In 1457 the first printed almanac was published at Mainz, by Gutenberg (eight years before the famous Bible). Regio-Montanus produced an almanac in 1472 (Nuremberg, 1472), which continued in print for several centuries. In 1497 the Sheapheard’s Kalendar, translated from French (Richard Pynson) became the first almanac to be printed in English.

The player takes the role of a person hit by a car and awakes to find himself in an unfamiliar world with medieval fantasy setting where he is tasked with taking care of the local cemetery and church. Determined to return home and reunite with his lover, the graveyard keeper interacts with the locals while helping with their problems. Eventually, the keeper learns of a portal that can be used to get back home, but needs some special magic items to make it work, which are in possession of some of the village's most influential characters. After earning their trust and obtaining the items, the keeper bids farewell to his friends but instead of returning him home, the portal brings his lover to his side instead. Extra DLC content reveals that the keeper can't return home because he (just like his predecessors) has the sacred task of acting as an intermediary between the village's inhabitants and the afterlife and it was revealed that the Ancient God brought him here and split him in two: His aggressive side is sent to the Town while his compassionate side had his memory wiped of what happened to him recently and was assigned to become the new graveyard keeper for the village (This is also why he cannot enter the town and dies every time he attempts to do so).

A fourth, paid DLC called "Better Save Soul" was released on October 28, 2021. It offers the chance for the player to investigate the sins of the corpses brought to them. With the help of a new shady friend, Euric, and an amnesiac half-ghost Smiler, the player must remove the sins from the living and dead alike. This DLC also offers new ways to improve the quality of corpses and adds remote control to some of the crafting stations.
The DLC for Graveyard Keeper, "Breaking Dead" was announced in 2018 free for owners of the base game. A resurrection table is added to your morgue, and you can reanimate corpses and set them to work on any of the many ongoing tasks that fuel your enterprise, from gathering stone and wood, to crafting items and writing books, as well as taking care of your garden and hauling merchandise to market. With enough zombies of high enough quality, it becomes possible to automate your entire supply chain, leaving you free to focus on progressing through the main storyline.[5][6]

It introduces a new Tavern for you to manage by producing and selling food and drink in large quantities at excellent prices, and an entirely new quest-chain which adds personalities to many of the previously-silent villagers. It also adds a new ending for completing the main game after finishing the DLC questline.[7][8]

Graveyard Keeper is a graveyard-keeping management simulation game inspired by Stardew Valley and based on Harvest Moon.[4] At the start of the game, the player becomes the recipient of a plot of land including a small graveyard once owned by his predecessor near a small town. The cemetery plot is initially overrun with boulders, trees, stumps, and weeds, and the player must work to clear them in order to restart its operation, tending to graves and even the church so as to generate revenue and bring donations to church coffers. Your ultimate goal is to get your character to open a portal back to his old world. To that end, you need information and help from various NPCs, whom you will be trying to please them, or do their quests. Such quests usually involves gameplay elements like bringing them some crafted or collectable items like oil, honey etc. More gameplay elements and areas slowly unlock throughout the game as you unlock new technologies. The skill tree in this game is called a Technology Tree, and you unlock new technologies to progress in the game. Beyond the early game, Graveyard Keeper requires you to have three different types of experience points: Red, Blue, and Green to unlock most of the technologies. Other than tending to graves and clearing out environmental elements, the game also has farming, smithing, rudimentary combat, multi-level dungeon, fishing, and an extensive crafting system.

New to Shadowbringers, players may enter dungeons using computer-controlled "Trust" companions rather than other players. These companions vary based on when the dungeon occurs in the story, and have unique dialogue.[7] This system takes inspiration from the Gambit system in Final Fantasy XII, and the characters are programmed to take actions reflecting their personality.[8] Trust supports players new to or unfamiliar with online games, eliminates the wait for matching to other players when used, and provides experience points for secondary jobs.[5][9] Further providing experience points, Shadowbringers quests outside the Main Scenario Quest now scale between levels 70 and 80. Role quests for the different combat, crafting, and gathering job teach aspects of these roles while expanding on the story and history of the First.[3]

Tying into the broader theme, Shadowbringers challenges the assumption that the history written by the victors is "right".[34] In this vein, Oda was inspired by Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together to create a more complex story.[25] On the First, Dwarves are considered a "Beastman" race, unlike on the Source, which is an example of how the politics of victors influence the interpretation of history.[6][35] Ishikawa and Oda wanted to give players a better sense of the Ascians' perspective and motivations, since they had heretofore been enigmatic.[25] They chose Emet-Selch to convey this because of his connection to the Garlean Empire's founding. His personality draws influence from Jack Sparrow of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Oda was careful not to make him too similar to Ardyn Izunia, the villain of Final Fantasy XV.[36] Emet-Selch explains his history in order to humanize the Ascians and help players to understand their goals.[25] Ishikawa wrote Emet-Selch as a character whose actions are "monstrous", yet his background makes him "relatable on some level". She enjoyed evoking this tension and ambivalence in the audience.[37]

The Scions go to Il Mheg, Feo Ul's homeland, reuniting with Urianger. The Lightwarden of Il Mheg is the King of the fae, Titania, who locked themself in their castle to protect their people. The newly-minted Warrior of Darkness gathers the regalia to enter the castle and slays Titania. Feo Ul succeeds Titania as king, leading the defense of Il Mheg as night returns. Returning to the Crystarium, the Scions meet Solus zos Galvus, who introduces himself as the Ascian Emet-Selch. He offers aid and knowledge of the Ascians' true motives. The Scions tentatively listen, and travel to the Rak'tika Greatwood seeking Y'shtola. After a tense reunion, the Scions explore the Ronkan Empire's ruins. Their protectors, the amazonian Viis, help the Scions slay Rak'tika's Lightwarden. Emet-Selch reveals Hydaelyn's and Zodiark's origin: they are in fact not gods, but primals, created by his people. Zodiark stopped some terrible disaster, and Hydaelyn imprisoned Him when others grew fearful of His power. The Warrior later overhears Y'shtola interrogating Urianger, as she can see the Warrior is being altered by the absorbed Lightwarden aether.

Transitioning from Stormblood to Shadowbringers, the Warrior's closest allies fall into comas one by one, leaving the Warrior isolated. The Garlean Empire also resumes its campaign against Eorzea. The Empire begins mass-producing Black Rose, a chemical weapon which halts all biological activity even in tiny doses, to retaliate against Ala Mhigo's successful war of independence. Emet-Selch, an Ascian leader and the true identity of Garlean Empire founder Solus zos Galvus, accelerates his plans to destroy the First, so Zodiark will be whole again. Having escaped the sundering, he sees present-day people as disturbing husks, not truly alive, and thus claims to feel no remorse for his deeds.[24]

The remaining Lightwardens hide; the Scions seek out "their" Minfilia's soul, which puts the young "Minfilia" at risk. While Thancred holds Ran'jit at bay, the Warrior and young Minfilia go to where the original halted the Flood. She bids the young girl decide her own fate, and willingly passes on, bequeathing her Oracle powers. Renamed Ryne by Thancred, she locates the remaining Lightwardens, including the final one: Lord Vauthry himself. The Echo reveals Emet-Selch offered Vauthry's father a deal: bind a Lightwarden to his unborn son, who will thus control sin eaters. After the Warrior kills Ran'jit, Vauthry flees Eulmore, hiding atop Mount Gulg. Aided by allies from all across Norvrandt, the Scions reach Mount Gulg, where the Warrior defeats Vauthry. The total Light is too much, however, and they begin to transform. The Exarch, revealed as G'raha Tia, tries to absorb it and then flee between worlds, knowing he will die in doing so. Emet-Selch stops him, ending his truce and declaring the Warrior has failed his test. He departs with G'raha to the ocean floor, the Tempest.
Norvrandt is Eorzea's mirror on the First, but one unaffected by the Source's Calamities.[6][20] Central Lakeland hosts the Crystal Tower, which mysteriously appeared a century prior. The Crystarium grew around it, driven by cooperative work ethic and led by the enigmatic Crystal Exarch. Decadent Eulmore in Kholusia pampers its wealthy citizens with indolent luxury. Lord Vauthry built this paradise with slave labor, forcing the poor refugees at its gates to compete for the privilege of servitude. Vauthry's inspirations include Jabba the Hut.[21] Dwarves, the First's Lalafell, live in Kholusia's mountains as an insular Tribe of miners and blacksmiths.[6] The Seven Sisters cliffs provided visual references for Kholusia.[22] The Rak'tika Greatwood houses the Ronkan Empire's ruins and the Night's Blessed, a religious community hiding from the Light beneath the jungle canopy. Angkor Wat and Mesoamerican civilizations inspired Ronkan architecture.[22][23] Il Mheg is the magic faerie land—pixies, fuath, nu mou, and amaro—in the former, now-fallen Kingdom of Voeburt. Finally, Amh Araeng is the desert where Minfilia halted the Flood, still having crystallized waves of frozen Light. The rest of the planet is covered by the Empty, a vast, lifeless white expanse.

Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers[a] is the third expansion pack to Final Fantasy XIV, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Square Enix for macOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows. It released on July 2, 2019, two years after Stormblood. As before, Naoki Yoshida served as director and producer and Masayoshi Soken composed the soundtrack. It released as a standalone product for current players; for new players, the "Complete Edition," originally launched with Heavensward, was updated to include all available expansions.

Masayoshi Soken composed the majority of the expansion's score—over 50 tracks—in addition to his duties as sound director. Nobuo Uematsu was not able to contribute due to health concerns.[44] As such, Soken was in charge of writing the main theme, "Shadowbringers".[32] He wanted to defy expectations about making another orchestral title track. Consequently, "Shadowbringers" is the first main theme in the Final Fantasy series that uses guitar as the lead instrument.[68] Jason C. Miller of Godhead provided vocals for the song alongside Amanda Achen-Keenan.[69] Soken's favorite song from the soundtrack is "Tomorrow and Tomorrow", also sung by Achen-Keenan, which serves as a reflection of the main theme.[15][70] The two songs have similar introductory phrases but "Shadowbringers" is in a minor key, whereas "Tomorrow and Tomorrow" is in a major one, symbolizing the diverging paths that life can take.[31] Ishikawa explained that the latter is about passing the torch to another generation. The perspective of the singer is intentionally ambiguous and could plausibly refer to many characters.[37] Soken used tracks that were rearranged from earlier expansions as opportunities to train junior members of the sound team.[68]

The Warrior first seeks the twins, Alphinaud and Alisaie. Alphinaud is investigating Eulmore and its unusual prosperity, while Alisaie aids a hospice in Amh Araeng, comforting sin eater victims before their euthanization. With the twins, the Exarch, and Lyna, his adopted daughter and right hand, the Warrior saves the villagers of Holminster Switch, defeating a powerful sin eater, a "Lightwarden." When these creatures are slain, their aether infects the person who slew them, creating another Lightwarden. However, Hydaelyn's Blessing of Light shields the Warrior against this. The sky above Lakeland goes dark for the first time in a century, leading to rumors among the people that the Warrior of Darkness has come to save them. Lord Vauthry sends his general Ran'jit to investigate. The Exarch rebuffs Ran'jit, and reunites the Warrior with Thancred and his ward, a young girl named "Minfilia," rescued from Ran'jit's custody. She is Minfilia's latest incarnation, who was revered on the First as the Oracle of Light.
Shadowbringers takes place on the First, a parallel dimension on the brink of collapse, where the player character is summoned to rescue and restore the world. Several comrades accidentally trapped there join them, as well as Emet-Selch, an immortal villain who seeks to harness the First's apocalypse to restore his deity, Zodiark. Emet-Selch accompanies and tests the player character, confident despite their meddling. In addition to adding new areas, the expansion pack increased the level cap, debuted two character classes and two playable races, and introduced the ability to explore dungeons with non-playable "Trust" companions.

Shadowbringers opens as the Warrior and Tataru reach the Source's Crystal Tower, hoping to restore the comatose Scions. The Warrior is then summoned across worlds to the Crystarium, meeting the Crystal Exarch. He states bringing the Warrior was his goal, with the Scions an accident. As time flows differently between Shards, the Scions have lived years on the First. He explains the First's pending doom: uncontrolled, the excess Light will trigger a Calamity, ending civilization on the Source. Retiring to provided rooms, the Warrior meets Feo Ul, a friendly and adventuresome pixie, and Ardbert, one of the Warriors of Darkness that Minfillia came with to halt the Flood of Light. The others sacrificed themselves to help her, but Ardbert was denied the chance, becoming a shade and witnessing Norvrandt's slow decline over the past century.

Shadowbringers occurs on the First, a parallel world split long ago from the Source, the original setting. Eons ago, Hydaelyn sundered the world to imprison Zodiark. The Ascians, Zodiark's pre-sundering immortal servants, trigger Calamities on the Source to "Rejoin" the Shards. They manipulated the heroes of the First to destroy too much Darkness, creating a lethal excess of Light. This Flood of Light erased everything, and everyone, outside the continent of Norvrandt. Minfilia, the player's ally and Oracle of Light, sacrificed herself to halt the Flood during Heavensward. Survivors in the post-apocalypic world resist monstrous "sin eaters," which feed on the living, warping them into more sin eaters.

Gameplay at large remains unchanged from Final Fantasy XIV: players interact with each other in a responsive persistent world. Maximum level increased to 80, with changes to improve flow and preserve job identity.[1] Tank jobs lost the penalty to damage while focused on holding enemy attention, based on player feedback.[2] Resources, such as magic points, were rebalanced for ease of use.[3] Two new jobs were added, Gunbreaker and Dancer.[4] Gunbreaker, a tank, wields gunblades, taking from Final Fantasy VIII where these weapons first appeared.[5] Dancer, a ranged damage-dealer, wields chakrams, drawing inspiration from real-world folk dances, with an emphasis on "encouraging allies."[6] The team added a new tank job to balance the number of main and secondary tanks, and a new ranged damage dealer as one had not been added for several years. They refrained from adding a new healer job in order to maintain game balance between the three existing healers.[4]
Planning for Shadowbringers began in May 2017, about one month prior to the release of the preceding expansion, Stormblood, with a "scriptwriting retreat" involving producer and director Naoki Yoshida and the main scenario writers, Natsuko Ishikawa and Banri Oda.[21][25][26] The process for developing an expansion involves laying out the progression from main game to expansion in detail and categorizing these elements so that developers would not get confused between patch content and expansion content which were being created simultaneously.[25][27] Expansions for Final Fantasy XIV are designed to compete with offline RPGs in length and content.[28] For Yoshida, the theme of Shadowbringers is "challenging expectations".[28] He wanted to challenge the assumption that "Light" equates to "good" within the story and challenge the development team to deliver an expansion that could surprise players.[5] The Trust system subverts the expectation that an MMORPG must be played with a group. Finally, Yoshida challenged players to compare Shadowbringers to main numbered entries in the Final Fantasy series.[28]

Shadowbringers received widespread critical and popular acclaim, particularly for its writing and focus on player accessibility. In December 2019, Square Enix announced that the title had reached a cumulative total of 18 million player accounts. As with its predecessors, major content patches were scheduled for every three months. These updates expanded the main story, added new features, and premiered secondary storylines including a crossover written by Yoko Taro that features characters and elements from Nier: Automata and the Restoration of Ishgard, a long term campaign to rebuild the embattled nation in the aftermath of the Dragonsong War. The third major content patch had its release delayed by two months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Eorzean Alliance exploits the chaos in Garlemald to focus on resolving disputes with the Tribes. Meanwhile, Alisaie seeks a cure for Tempering, aided by the Ironworks and G'raha; they succeed, and are able to heal Ga Bu, her young kobold friend. In Limsa Lominsa, the Scions aid Merlwyb with an internal political dispute, and manage to peacefully cure the kobold Patriarch's tempering. Mysterious towers appear worldwide. Fandaniel reveals himself and his Telophoroi servants. With the death of Elidibus, no Unsundered Ascians remain, leaving him free to pursue his true goal: the destruction of all life. He threatens to raze cities across the world with a strange, corrupted primal dubbed "Lunar Bahamut," should the Warrior refuse to face Zenos again. The Scions investigate the towers while Krile and Tataru seek out Estinien's aid against Lunar Bahamut.
The Main Story of A Realm Reborn was also given a major overhaul in the 5.3 patch. Many quests and objectives deemed to be unnecessary have been removed from the Main Story Quest for new players, especially in patch content for A Realm Reborn. Flight became unlocked for players in A Realm Reborn areas after completing its original Main Story. Further, a New Game Plus mode was added, allowing players to replay certain Main and Side Story quests.

The characters of Shadowbringers, particularly Ardbert, Elidibus, and Emet-Selch, earned critical acclaim as well. Kyle Campbell of IGN said Ardbert "stole the show" while debriefing the hero after each mission.[83] Natalie Flores of VG247 felt that Emet-Selch was a true foil to the main character and that the writing for his character was a high water mark for the series. She commended scenario writer Natsuko Ishikawa for balancing him as a sympathetic villain without justifying his reprehensible supremacist beliefs.[24] Messner called Emet-Selch the "best Final Fantasy nemesis since Kefka".[84] Alexandra appreciated the "adversarial" but "genuinely playful" dynamic that he brought to the group.[95] She attributed part of his appeal to his voice actor, René Zagger.[96][75] Natalie Flores from Vice called Elidibus a "chilling adversary" and "populism incarnate",[97] while Chingy Nea from Kotaku lauded him as one of the most brilliant and memorable villains in the entire Final Fantasy series, "a fascinating character with a compelling and metatextual emotional arc".[98] The voice cast overall was well received.[83][84][86] Many reviewers also enjoyed the immersive quality of Trust companions' dialogue and preferred to explore dungeons for the first time using Trusts as a result.[74][87][92]

A major focus during development was to make the game more friendly to new adventurers. The Trust system was designed to help people who are primarily familiar with offline RPGs and other Final Fantasy games to practice multiplayer content without the pressure of other players.[9] The new Dancer job was intended to be easy for beginners to pick up as well.[28] The team made adjustments to older quest rewards to help new players catch up to their friends playing Shadowbringers more quickly.[25] Moreover, the "story skip" and "level boost" items introduced in Stormblood were updated to allow access to Shadowbringers directly.[38] Ishgardian Restoration and the related changes to crafting and gathering were an effort to make these systems more accessible.[10] Finally, the New Game+ feature and streamlining the A Realm Reborn quest line together improve new players' experience at the start of their adventure. The development team reworked aspects of these quests, removing portions of some and eliminating others entirely, to improve the pacing without damaging the story. They also implemented flying gameplay in these areas.[39] New Game+ allows players to replay expansions and quest lines that they have already completed.[10][40]

Renovations to the crafting and gathering jobs were applied across the patch cycle to improve accessibility to newcomers,[10] removing redundant abilities and providing more information to players.[11] These updates dovetailed with the Ishgardian Restoration, a massive, collaborative, player-run public works project to rebuild an Ishgardian residential district destroyed in the Dragonsong War.[12] Unfolding over the course of several patches, it provided rewards to beginners and experienced characters alike.[13][14] The Diadem, a large open world area that premiered in Heavensward, was reconfigured as the source of raw materials for reconstruction.[15] The reconstruction provided the narrative justification for a new player housing ward, the Empyreum, added in the following expansion, Endwalker. The content remains for player use, offering large sources of crafting and gathering experience.

In May 2021, during the Final Fantasy XIV Digital Fan Festival, Soken announced that he had been receiving chemotherapy for cancer treatment throughout most of 2020, adding that the cancer was in remission. Soken kept the treatment hidden from most of the development team, doing some of his work for Shadowbringers' patch content from hospital.[78]
Elidibus attacks G'raha and Beq Lugg, stealing a prototype vessel with G'raha's blood and memories. Elidibus thus controls the Tower, and summons hundreds of spectral "Warriors of Light" to impede the heroes. The Warrior of Darkness reaches the Tower and fights Elidibus, who has taken the form of the "Warrior of Light" of legend; it is revealed that the Warrior's soul once belonged to Azem, the Fourteenth Seat of the Convocation. Together, the Warrior and G'raha defeat Elidibus, sealing him in the Tower, but G'raha's over-use of its powers fully crystallizes his body. The Warrior returns to the Source and restores their allies, then awakens the G'raha of the Source using the prototype soul-vessel. G'raha, with all the memories of the First, joins the Scions. Meanwhile, Zenos usurps the imperial throne, gaining the Ascian Fandaniel as an ally with all the knowledge a sundered Ascian can provide, and plans his reunion with the Warrior.

Shadowbringers was the highest rated Final Fantasy title since Final Fantasy XII in 2006.[88] Many critics regarded it as the best Final Fantasy story in years,[37][86][89] with some considering it a contender for best Final Fantasy game.[74][76][83][84][87] According to review aggregator Metacritic, it received "universal acclaim" for both PC and PlayStation 4 versions, based on 25 and 18 reviews, respectively.[79][80] Square Enix disclosed in an investor report that the expansion contributed to the company's increased net sales, operating income, and paying subscribers.[90] Two million players joined the game in the first six months since the expansion's launch in July 2019 for a global total of 18 million.[91]
Another focal point of praise was the game's friendliness to new players.[92] Despite its connections to past story beats, setting the expansion in a new world allowed the writers to reintroduce existing characters.[99] Ricardo Contreras of Waypoint compared Shadowbringers favorably to the new player experience for Destiny 2.[99] Multiple commentators looked to the Trust system as valuable, both for aiding new and experienced players in learning mechanics and for improving wait times for dungeons.[74][82][83][87][92] Daniel Tack of Game Informer and Leif Johnson of PC World cautioned against buying the paid "story skip" and "level boost" items, instead recommending players to experience the story for themselves.[82][87] However, Contreras appreciated the onboarding tutorials that accompany these items.[99]

Back on the First, the Scions elect to tell the true story of that world's Warriors of Light. However, their efforts are exploited by Elidibus for inscrutable ends, as he seems to want to awaken the Echo in the populous. He reveals the Echo is a trace of the Ancients' power, not a gift from Hydaelyn. Unable to oppose Elidibus without undoing their own efforts, the Scions continue investigating means to return home. In Amaurot, they find an archival hologram of the Ancient Venat, who intended to become Hydaelyn's heart just as Elidibus became Zodiark's. Elidibus interrupts, putting the Warrior through a gauntlet based on their adventures, but framed far more darkly. Y'shtola intervenes, deducing that Elidibus is a primal of his original self, separated from Zodiark. Furthermore, Elidibus is the original source of the "Warrior of Light" legend, and uses that faith to increase his power.

They convene with the Alliance in Ala Mhigo. Lyse has discovered the towers can somehow temper individuals into revering Garlemald, rather than a primal. Raubahn proposes sending Fordola and Arenvald, who are protected from tempering by Resonant and Echo powers. After, the twins, G'raha, and the Warrior bring Estinien to Ayzs Lla to consult the great wyrm Tiamat about Lunar Bahamut. Breaking both her physical constraints and her mental ones, the shame and tempering she bears from summoning Bahamut, they secure her aid. The Telophoroi assault Paglth'an, the Amalj'aa homeland, led by Lunar Bahamut; the Alliance comes to their aid, and the Warrior defeats the primal, with Tiamat leaving to protect her remaining children. In Ul'dah, Nanamo reveals Arenvald was horribly injured and may never walk again, but shares his and Fordola's findings: Amalj'aa prisoners have summoned a "Lunar Ifrit." Further, there is news of other "lunar" primals. The Scions gather, and Krile proposes petitioning Sharlayan for aid against the Telophoroi. Estinien fully joins the Scions, inspired by their example.

A variety of other systems also received updates in Shadowbringers. Blue Mage, a "Limited" job introduced in Stormblood, received a major extension.[16] Blue Mages uniquely learn actions from observing monsters, but because this allows unbalanced combinations, the job is Limited and cannot use normal player matchmaking.[17] The update adds rewards and titles for facing difficult content with a party composed solely of Blue Mages.[16] A new alliance-scale player versus player (PvP) mode called Onsal Hakair (Danshig Naadam) premiered with the expansion, where players participate in mock wargames preparing for the yearly Naadam,[18] scoring points by holding locations.[19]

The Alliance and Tribes convene in Ala Mhigo to set aside their differences and unite as the Grand Company of Eorzea. The Sharlayan envoy, the twins' father Fourchenault, angrily rebuffs the Alliance and disowns his children for their allegedly barbaric behavior. He further claims that, if the Final Days were coming, Sharlayan would know. News arrives that the Telophoroi march upon Carteneau Flats. The Grand Company of Eorzea and the Scions rush to defend the aetherial confluences buried there. They repel the Telophoroi and their primals. The Scions seek passage to Old Sharlayan to investigate the Forum's apparent knowledge of the Final Days. As the Scions learn the Towers drain the land of aether, the Warrior sees a strange female apparition, who warns them of the coming apocalypse. Fandaniel prepares to open the "gate of the gods," while Zenos discards his katanas for a scythe, honing his skills for the rematch he longs for.

Reviewers considered Shadowbringers to be the culmination of Final Fantasy XIV's redemption arc, from its disastrous 2010 launch to its rebirth to now.[74][83][87][92] Despite largely following the "formula cemented back in [A Realm Reborn]", Carter enjoyed the consistency and said the game is "arguably the best it has ever been".[81] Johnson called Shadowbringers a titan of the MMORPG genre that "towers so far over its contemporary rivals that it drowns them in its shadow".[87] During the 2019 awards cycle, it won "Best MMO" from RPGFan,[100] as well as "Best Expansion" from PC Gamer and Massively OP.[94][101] IGN and PlayStation Blog named it "Best Ongoing Game".[102][103] RPGFan also awarded it "Game of the Year".[104] Emet-Selch was voted the sixth greatest Final Fantasy character in NHK's Grand Poll by Japanese fans,[105] and ranked among the 70 best video game characters of the 2010s decade by Polygon.[106] In 2020, Shadowbringers won the Famitsu・Dengeki Game Award for "Best Online Game" and the SXSW Gaming Award for "Excellence in Multiplayer".[107][108]

Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers Original Soundtrack features music from Patch 4.4 through to the expansion, totaling 88 tracks. The album was released by Square Enix on September 11, 2019 on Blu-ray disc and includes a code for an exclusive "Wind-up Suzaku" in-game pet.[71] Fran Soto of Hardcore Gamer praised the dark atmosphere and "modern sound" of the soundtrack, including the lyrical flourishes of "Shadowbringers".[72] Justin Olivetti of Massively OP preferred "Insatiable", the boss battle theme, for its "pulse-pounding beat".[73] In her review of the game, Heather Alexandra of Kotaku commended Soken's versatility and ability to heighten story beats with his music.[74] She singled out "Neath Dark Waters", the theme for Amaurot; the metronomic tick-tock in the background counts down to the doom of this civilization.[68][75] Caitlin Argyros of RPGFan likewise noted this piece as an example of Soken's gift for rearrangement. She also enjoyed the recurring motifs from the "Shadowbringers" main theme throughout the soundtrack.[76] A fan favorite track was "Civilizations", the daytime theme for Rak'tika Greatwood; its main lyric "la hee" became an infamous earworm in the community.[77]

Early access to Shadowbringers began on June 28, 2019 for people who pre-ordered the game with the full release on July 2, 2019.[51] To facilitate graphical enhancements, active support for 32-bit Windows operating systems and DirectX 9 rendering libraries ended with the launch of early access.[9][52] To promote the expansion, Square Enix filmed a commercial in which Tom Holland undergoes strength training to become a Warrior of Darkness and his roommate, Hannibal Buress, complains that such training is unnecessary to play a video game.[53] An Xbox version of the game was announced in November 2019.[54] Yoshida explained that his primary requirement for the Xbox release was cross platform interoperability with the PlayStation and PC versions.[55] In addition to delaying the release of Patch 5.3, the COVID-19 pandemic forced Square Enix to cancel events at PAX East 2020 in Boston, Final Fantasy XIV rock concerts in Tokyo, and the three Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival events in San Diego, London, and Tokyo.[56][57][58][59]

Critics took note of the game's setting on another world. The region of Il Mheg was commonly used as an example of the expansion's diverse color palette; Lee said it "doesn't look like anything else we've seen in Final Fantasy XIV".[84][85][86][92] Williams likewise complimented Lakeland for its "vibrant purple forest that leads to the magnificent crystal tower at the center of the Crystarium".[86] Carter considered Amh Araeng too similar to other desert areas in the game but agreed that the rest of the new regions were impressive.[81] Gameplay reception focused on the new jobs and the pacing. Between Gunbreaker and Dancer, the latter received far more plaudits.[74][83][85][86][87] Campbell remarked on the synchrony between the job's theming and its gameplay, calling it "as exciting as it is full of utility".[83] In contrast, Williams opined that Gunbreaker lacked a defining feature and did not "particularly excel in any one area".[86] With respect to pacing, Tack and Messner both criticized the use of "fetch quests" but felt that the narrative hid them well.[82][84] Alexandra found some parts of the story dragged, such as Amh Araeng, but the high points far outweighed them.[74]

The development team schedules the release of a major update approximately every three months. Each of these free content patches includes a continuation of the main scenario as well as new raids, features, trials, and dungeons. Minor patches that come in between major updates focus on quality of life improvements. With Shadowbringers, Yoshida reallocated resources to facilitate the development of new types of content (e.g. Bozjan Southern Front, additional trials, etc.) by reducing the number of dungeons added in patches.[15][60] As with previous expansions, Square Enix released five major patches for Shadowbringers over the course of its two-year content cycle.
Two new playable races were released alongside Shadowbringers—Viera and Hrothgar. The Viera are based on the leporine race of the same name from Ivalice video games and the Hrothgar are based on the leonine Ronso from Final Fantasy X.[41] Players were initially only able to select females of the former and males of the latter to use as avatars. Yoshida explained that resource constraints prevented the team from adding all genders to the two races, chiefly the need to redesign and adjust the enormous library of existing equipment to fit with the new character models.[4] Within the fiction, male Viera and female Hrothgar are extremely rare and generally seclude themselves from other societies.[42] In choosing these two races, the development team wanted to address the audience's "overwhelming desire" for Viera as well as increase the variety of body types available with the "beastly" Hrothgar.[4][6] As this was likely the last opportunity to add a new race to the game owing to the cumulative costs of implementation, the team decided to only introduce one gender of each to satisfy both of these goals.[4] The other genders were later added in the next expansion, Endwalker, due to overwhelming player demand.[43]

Ryne temporarily stabilizes the Warrior, but Light returns to all Norvrandt's skies. They learn that G'raha came from a timeline where Black Rose, supercharged with Light, caused the Eighth Umbral Calamity. The Ironworks held together, opened the Crystal Tower, and by combining the powers of Alexander and Omega, sent G'raha back in time. The Scions pursue Emet-Selch to the Tempest, where he has placed an illusion of his capital city, Amaurot, over its own ruins. A self-aware simulacrum, Hythlodaeus, says three-quarters of Ancients were willingly sacrificed to create Zodiark, to save and restore the world from a great disaster. Dissident Ancients opposed this, summoning Hydaelyn to stop Him. Emet-Selch tests the Scions again with an illusion of the disaster that destroyed Amaurot, the Final Days, but remains unimpressed. The Warrior nearly succumbs to the Light before Ardbert, in truth a shard of the Warrior's soul, merges into and heals them. Emet-Selch battles the Warrior under his true name, Hades. Defeated, he dies, with his final request that the Warrior remember his people. The Scions and G'raha return to the Crystarium, now looking for a means to send the Scions back to their world.

Virtually all reviewers extolled the strength of the story and writing. Chris Carter of Destructoid and Steven Messner of PC Gamer called Shadowbringers the "Avengers: Endgame of Final Fantasy XIV" for the way it pays off storylines from previous expansions.[81][84] Mike Williams of USgamer observed that a central theme for Shadowbringers is "how people grow and twist in times of great despair". He pointed to the contrast between the altruistic cooperation of the Crystarium and the selfish hedonism of Eulmore as possible responses to a dying world.[86] Julia Lee of Polygon compared Eulmore to the class divides physically represented by the plates in Midgar from Final Fantasy VII.[92] A number of critics observed parallels between the First's Flood of Light and the creeping yet catastrophic effects of climate change.[24][75][85][93][94] Heather Alexandra of Kotaku lamented that economic inequality would likely lead to slave-driven enclaves like Eulmore in the real world after a climate-related collapse. She further linked the "unchecked energy of creation" that destroyed Amaurot to human ingenuity's role in causing the climate crisis.[75]

Yoshida instructed the writing team to fulfill three requirements with the expansion story: a story that takes place in the alternate dimension of the First, entails the player becoming a "Warrior of Darkness", and involves adventuring together with the Scions—to take advantage of the newly developed Trust system.[21] The idea to return to the Warriors of Darkness and Minfilia on the First occurred shortly after the release of Stormblood. The writing team felt it was the right timing after wrapping up the liberation of Ala Mhigo.[29] They also connected it to G'raha Tia and the Crystal Tower storyline from A Realm Reborn.[30] On the First, the environment is drowning in Light. Multiple teams worked to deliver this effect of "heavy and oppressive Light" without it feeling insufferable.[22][15][26] The art team adjusted color balance to avoid it getting washed out or make the various environments look too similar.[26] The sound team designed a "halation" sound effect that plays in areas overflowing with Light. It manifests as an ambient sound with high and low frequencies that is intended to evoke a sense of uneasiness and suffocation.[15][31] Another challenge in designing the First was setting it apart from the Source world; the different teams needed to consider how 10,000 years of diverging history would impact its culture despite featuring the same races of people.[26][32][33]
