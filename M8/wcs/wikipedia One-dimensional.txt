In physics and mathematics, a sequence of n numbers can specify a location in n-dimensional space. When n = 1, the set of all such locations is called a one-dimensional space. An example of a one-dimensional space is the number line, where the position of each point on it can be described by a single number.[1]

In algebraic geometry there are several structures that are technically one-dimensional spaces but referred to in other terms. A field k is a one-dimensional vector space over itself. Similarly, the projective line over k is a one-dimensional space. In particular, if k = ℂ, the complex numbers, then the complex projective line P1(ℂ) is one-dimensional with respect to ℂ, even though it is also known as the Riemann sphere.

More generally, a ring is a length-one module over itself. Similarly, the projective line over a ring is a one-dimensional space over the ring. In case the ring is an algebra over a field, these spaces are one-dimensional with respect to the algebra, even if the algebra is of higher dimensionality.

Nearest distance between skew lines, for the perpendicular distance between two non-parallel lines in three-dimensional space
The distance from a point to a line is the distance to the nearest point on that line. That is the point at which a segment from it to the given point is perpendicular to the line.
Step 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ.
A line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines intersect at a right angle.[2] Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if (1) the two lines meet; and (2) at the point of intersection the straight angle on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two congruent angles. Perpendicularity can be shown to be symmetric, meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order. A great example of perpendicularity can be seen in any compass, note the cardinal points; North, East, South, West (NESW)The line N-S is perpendicular to the line W-E and the angles N-E, E-S, S-W and W-N are all 90° to one another.
The distance from a point to a plane is measured as the length from the point along a segment that is perpendicular to the plane, meaning that it is perpendicular to all lines in the plane that pass through the nearest point in the plane to the given point.
In geometry, the perpendicular distance between two objects is the distance from one to the other, measured along a line that is perpendicular to one or both.

The transverse axis of a hyperbola is perpendicular to the conjugate axis and to each directrix.
In the two-dimensional plane, right angles can be formed by two intersected lines if the product of their slopes equals−1. Thus defining two linear functions: y1 = a1x + b1 and y2 = a2x + b2, the graphs of the functions will be perpendicular and will make four right angles where the lines intersect if a1a2 = −1. However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis).

If two lines (a and b) are both perpendicular to a third line (c), all of the angles formed along the third line are right angles.Therefore, in Euclidean geometry, any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are parallel to each other, because of the parallel postulate.Conversely, if one line is perpendicular to a second line, it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line.

Perpendicularity easily extends to segments and rays. For example, a line segment AB¯{\displaystyle {\overline {AB}}} is perpendicular to a line segment CD¯{\displaystyle {\overline {CD}}} if, when each is extended in both directions to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above. In symbols, AB¯⊥CD¯{\displaystyle {\overline {AB}}\perp {\overline {CD}}} means line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD.[3]
Up to three lines in three-dimensional space can be pairwise perpendicular, as exemplified by the x, y, and z axes of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

The altitudes of a triangle are perpendicular to their respective bases. The perpendicular bisectors of the sides also play a prominent role in triangle geometry.
The orthoptic property of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle.
To prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the SSS congruence theorem for QPA' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal.Then use the SAS congruence theorem for triangles OPA' and OPB' to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal.
In a square or other rectangle, all pairs of adjacent sides are perpendicular. A right trapezoid is a trapezoid that has two pairs of adjacent sides that are perpendicular.
For another method, let the two linear functions be: a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 and a2x + b2y + c2 = 0. The lines will be perpendicular if and only if a1a2 + b1b2 = 0. This method is simplified from the dot product (or, more generally, the inner product) of vectors. In particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero.

Perpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of orthogonality; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word "perpendicular" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its normal vector.
In elementary geometry, two geometric objects are perpendicular if their intersection forms right angles (angles that are 90 degrees or π/2 radians wide) at the point of intersection called a foot. The condition of perpendicularity may be represented graphically using the perpendicular symbol, ⟂. Perpendicular intersections can happen between two lines (or two line segments), between a line and a plane, and between two planes.
The word foot is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars. This usage is exemplified in the top diagram, above, and its caption. The diagram can be in any orientation. The foot is not necessarily at the bottom.

He was the first person in China who calculated infinite series and obtained more than 10 formulae. In the 1730s, he first established and used what was later to be known as Catalan numbers.[1][4] The Jesuit missionaries' influence can be seen by many traces of European mathematics in his works, including the use of Euclidean notions of continuous proportions, series addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, series reversion, and the binomial theorem. Minggatu's work is remarkable in that expansions in series, trigonometric and logarithmic were apprehended algebraically and inductively without the aid of differential and integral calculus.[3]
On May 26, 2002, the minor planet 28242 was named after Minggatu as 28242 Mingantu.[5] The nomination ceremony and traditional meeting were held in Minggatu's hometown in August 2002. More than 500 delegates and 20,000 local residents gathered together to celebrate and a conference on "The Science Contribution of Ming Antu" was held. The Chinese government named Ming’s hometown as "Ming Antu Town".[1]

Minggatu was born in Plain White Banner (now Plain and Bordered White Banner, Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia) of the Qing Empire. He was of the Sharaid clan. His name first appeared in official Chinese records in 1713, among the Kangxi Emperor's retinue, as a shengyuan (state-subsidized student) of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. He worked there at a time when Jesuit missionaries were in charge of calendar reforms. He also participated in the work of compiling and editing three very important books in astronomy and joined the team of China's area measurement.

Mathematician Dr. P. J. Larcombe of Derby University published 7 papers on Minggatu and his work in 1999, including the stimulus of Jesuit missionary, engineer, mathematician and geographer Pierre Jartoux, who brought three infinite series to China early in the 1700s.[1]
In 1742 he participated in the revision of the Compendium of Observational and Computational Astronomy. In 1756, he participated in the surveying of the Dzungar Khanate (renamed Xinjiang), which was incorporated into the Qing Empire by the Qianlong Emperor. It was due to his geographical surveys in Xinjiang that the Complete Atlas of the Empire (the first atlas of China drawn with scientific methods) was finished.[3]

A standard algebraic construction of systems satisfies these axioms.For a division ring D construct an (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over D (vector space dimension is the number of elements in a basis).Let P be the 1-dimensional (single generator) subspaces and L the 2-dimensional (two independent generators) subspaces (closed under vector addition) of this vector space.Incidence is containment.If D is finitethen it must be a finite field GF(q), since by Wedderburn's little theorem all finite division rings are fields. In this case, this construction produces a finite projective space. Furthermore, if the geometric dimension of a projective space is at least three then there is a division ring from which the space can be constructed in this manner. Consequently, all finite projective spaces of geometric dimension at least three are defined over finite fields. A finite projective space defined over such a finite field has q + 1 points on a line, so the two concepts of order coincide.Such a finite projective space is denoted by PG(n, q), where PG stands for projective geometry, n is the geometric dimension of the geometry and q is the size (order) of the finite field used to construct the geometry.
^ also referred to as the Veblen–Young axiom and mistakenly as the axiom of Pasch (Beutelspacher & Rosenbaum 1998, pgs. 6–7).Pasch was concerned with real projective space and was attempting to introduce order, which is not a concern of the Veblen–Young axiom.

Dimension at least 3:Two non-intersecting lines exist.The Veblen–Young theorem states in the finite case that every projective space of geometric dimension n ≥ 3 is isomorphic with a PG(n, q), the n-dimensional projective space over some finite field GF(q).
In 1906 Oswald Veblen and W. H. Bussey described projective geometry using homogeneous coordinates with entries from the Galois field GF(q). When n + 1 coordinates are used, the n-dimensional finite geometry is denoted PG(n, q).[5] It arises in synthetic geometry and has an associated transformation group.
Dimension 1 (exactly one line):All points lie on the unique line, called a projective line.
The best general result to date is the Bruck–Ryser theorem of 1949, which states:
A finite geometry is any geometric system that has only a finite number of points.The familiar Euclidean geometry is not finite, because a Euclidean line contains infinitely many points. A geometry based on the graphics displayed on a computer screen, where the pixels are considered to be the points, would be a finite geometry. While there are many systems that could be called finite geometries, attention is mostly paid to the finite projective and affine spaces because of their regularity and simplicity.Other significant types of finite geometry are finite Möbius or inversive planes and Laguerre planes, which are examples of a general type called Benz planes, and their higher-dimensional analogs such as higher finite inversive geometries.

An examination of the first two axioms shows that they are nearly identical, except that the roles of points and lines have been interchanged.This suggests the principle of duality for projective plane geometries, meaning that any true statement valid in all these geometries remains true if we exchange points for lines and lines for points.The smallest geometry satisfying all three axioms contains seven points. In this simplest of the projective planes, there are also seven lines; each point is on three lines, and each line contains three points.

A projective plane geometry is a nonempty set X (whose elements are called "points"), along with a nonempty collection L of subsets of X (whose elements are called "lines"), such that:
Every point is contained in 7 lines.Every pair of distinct points are contained in exactly one line and every pair of distinct planes intersects in exactly one line.
^ Dembowski 1968, p. 28, where the formula is given, in terms of vector space dimension, by Nk+1(n + 1, q).
The last axiom eliminates reducible cases that can be written as a disjoint union of projective spaces together with 2-point lines joining any two points in distinct projective spaces.More abstractly, it can be defined as an incidence structure (P, L, I) consisting of a set P of points, a set L of lines, and an incidence relation I stating which points lie on which lines.

The following remarks apply only to finite planes.There are two main kinds of finite plane geometry: affine and projective.In an affine plane, the normal sense of parallel lines applies.In a projective plane, by contrast, any two lines intersect at a unique point, so parallel lines do not exist.Both finite affine plane geometry and finite projective plane geometry may be described by fairly simple axioms.
Affine and projective planes of order n exist whenever n is a prime power (a prime number raised to a positive integer exponent), by using affine and projective planes over the finite field with n = pk elements. Planes not derived from finite fields also exist (e.g. for n=9{\displaystyle n=9}), but all known examples have order a prime power.[1]
The first axiomatic treatment of finite projective geometry was developed by the Italian mathematician Gino Fano. In his work[2] on proving the independence of the set of axioms for projective n-space that he developed,[3] he considered a finite three dimensional space with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes (see diagram), in which each line had only three points on it.[4]
Finite geometries may be constructed via linear algebra, starting from vector spaces over a finite field; the affine and projective planes so constructed are called Galois geometries.Finite geometries can also be defined purely axiomatically. Most common finite geometries are Galois geometries, since any finite projective space of dimension three or greater is isomorphic to a projective space over a finite field (that is, the projectivization of a vector space over a finite field). However, dimension two has affine and projective planes that are not isomorphic to Galois geometries, namely the non-Desarguesian planes.Similar results hold for other kinds of finite geometries.
Dimension 2:There are at least 2 lines, and any two lines meet.A projective space for n = 2 is a projective plane.These are much harder to classify, as not all of them are isomorphic with a PG(d, q).The Desarguesian planes (those that are isomorphic with a PG(2, q)) satisfy Desargues's theorem and are projective planes over finite fields, but there are many non-Desarguesian planes.
"The Search for a Finite Projective Plane of Order 10"
For some important differences between finite plane geometry and the geometry of higher-dimensional finite spaces, see axiomatic projective space.For a discussion of higher-dimensional finite spaces in general, see, for instance, the works of J.W.P. Hirschfeld.The study of these higher-dimensional spaces (n ≥ 3) has many important applications in advanced mathematical theories.
The geometric dimension of the space is said to be n if that is the largest number for which there is a strictly ascending chain of subspaces of this form:
For every two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both points.

A subspace of the projective space is a subset X, such that any line containing two points of X is a subset of X (that is, completely contained in X).The full space and the empty space are always subspaces.
Individual examples can be found in the work of Thomas Penyngton Kirkman (1847) and the systematic development of finite projective geometry given by von Staudt (1856).

A permutation of the Fano plane's seven points that carries collinear points (points on the same line) to collinear points is called a collineation of the plane. The full collineation group is of order 168 and is isomorphic to the groupPSL(2,7) ≈ PSL(3,2), which in this special case is also isomorphic to the general linear group GL(3,2) ≈ PGL(3,2).

The smallest integer that is not a prime power and not covered by the Bruck–Ryser theorem is 10; 10 is of the form 4k + 2, but it is equal to the sum of squares 12 + 32.

The next smallest number to consider is 12, for which neither a positive nor a negative result has been proved.
In general, the number of k-dimensional subspaces of PG(n, q) is given by the product:[8]
In any finite projective space, each line contains the same number of points and the order of the space is defined as one less than this common number.
PG(3,2) arises as the background for a solution of Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, which states: "Fifteen schoolgirls walk each day in five groups of three.Arrange the girls’ walk for a week so that in that time, each pair of girls walks together in a group just once." There are 35 different combinations for the girls to walk together.There are also 7 days of the week, and 3 girls in each group. Two of the seven non-isomorphic solutions to this problem can be stated in terms of structures in the Fano 3-space, PG(3,2), known as packings. A spread of a projective space is a partition of its points into disjoint lines, and a packing is a partition of the lines into disjoint spreads. In PG(3,2), a spread would be a partition of the 15 points into 5 disjoint lines (with 3 points on each line), thus corresponding to the arrangement of schoolgirls on a particular day. A packing of PG(3,2) consists of seven disjoint spreads and so corresponds to a full week of arrangements.
The smallest 3-dimensional projective space is over the field GF(2) and is denoted by PG(3,2).It has 15 points, 35 lines, and 15 planes.Each plane contains 7 points and 7 lines.Each line contains 3 points.As geometries, these planes are isomorphic to the Fano plane.
There exists a set of four points, no three of which belong to the same line.
which is a Gaussian binomial coefficient, a q analogue of a binomial coefficient.
This particular projective plane is sometimes called the Fano plane.If any of the lines is removed from the plane, along with the points on that line, the resulting geometry is the affine plane of order 2.The Fano plane is called the projective plane of order 2 because it is unique (up to isomorphism).In general, the projective plane of order n has n2 + n + 1 points and the same number of lines; each line contains n + 1 points, and each point is on n + 1 lines.

A pair of line segments can be any one of the following: intersecting, parallel, skew, or none of these. The last possibility is a way that line segments differ from lines: if two nonparallel lines are in the same Euclidean plane then they must cross each other, but that need not be true of segments.

Analogous to straight line segments above, one can also define arcs as segments of a curve.
In geometry, a line segment is a part of a straight line that is bounded by two distinct end points, and contains every point on the line that is between its endpoints. The length of a line segment is given by the Euclidean distance between its endpoints. A closed line segment includes both endpoints, while an open line segment excludes both endpoints; a half-open line segment includes exactly one of the endpoints. In geometry, a line segment is often denoted using a line above the symbols for the two endpoints (such as AB).[1]

Line segment intersection, the algorithmic problem of finding intersecting pairs in a collection of line segments
In an axiomatic treatment of geometry, the notion of betweenness is either assumed to satisfy a certain number of axioms, or defined in terms of an isometry of a line (used as a coordinate system).
When a line segment is given an orientation (direction) it is called a directed line segment. It suggests a translation or displacement (perhaps caused by a force). The magnitude and direction are indicative of a potential change. Extending a directed line segment semi-infinitely produces a ray and infinitely in both directions produces a directed line. This suggestion has been absorbed into mathematical physics through the concept of a Euclidean vector.[2][3] The collection of all directed line segments is usually reduced by making "equivalent" any pair having the same length and orientation.[4] This application of an equivalence relation dates from Giusto Bellavitis's introduction of the concept of equipollence of directed line segments in 1835.

An oriented plane segment or bivector generalizes the directed line segment.
Segments play an important role in other theories. For example, in a convex set, the segment that joins any two points of the set is contained in the set. This is important because it transforms some of the analysis of convex sets, to the analysis of a line segment. The segment addition postulate can be used to add congruent segment or segments with equal lengths, and consequently substitute other segments into another statement to make segments congruent.

Examples of line segments include the sides of a triangle or square. More generally, when both of the segment's end points are vertices of a polygon or polyhedron, the line segment is either an edge (of that polygon or polyhedron) if they are adjacent vertices, or a diagonal. When the end points both lie on a curve (such as a circle), a line segment is called a chord (of that curve).
Sometimes, one needs to distinguish between "open" and "closed" line segments. In this case, one would define a closed line segment as above, and an open line segment as a subset L that can be parametrized as

A line segment can be viewed as a degenerate case of an ellipse, in which the semiminor axis goes to zero, the foci go to the endpoints, and the eccentricity goes to one. A standard definition of an ellipse is the set of points for which the sum of a point's distances to two foci is a constant; if this constant equals the distance between the foci, the line segment is the result. A complete orbit of this ellipse traverses the line segment twice. As a degenerate orbit, this is a radial elliptic trajectory.
In an ellipse, the longest chord, which is also the longest diameter, is called the major axis, and a segment from the midpoint of the major axis (the ellipse's center) to either endpoint of the major axis is called a semi-major axis.Similarly, the shortest diameter of an ellipse is called the minor axis, and the segment from its midpoint (the ellipse's center) to either of its endpoints is called a semi-minor axis.The chords of an ellipse which are perpendicular to the major axis and pass through one of its foci are called the latera recta of the ellipse.

In the case of a real affine space, in other words when the coordinates are real numbers, this affine space separates the space into two half-spaces, which are the connected components of the complement of the hyperplane, and are given by the inequalities
An affine hyperplane isan affine subspace of codimension 1 in an affine space.In Cartesian coordinates, such a hyperplane can be described with a single linear equation of the following form (where at least one of the ai{\displaystyle a_{i}}s is non-zero and b{\displaystyle b} is an arbitrary constant):
The difference in dimension between a subspace S and its ambient space X is known as the codimension of S with respect to X.Therefore, a necessary and sufficient condition for S to be a hyperplane in X is for S to have codimension one in X.
The dihedral angle between two non-parallel hyperplanes of a Euclidean space is the angle between the corresponding normal vectors. The product of the transformations in the two hyperplanes is a rotation whose axis is the subspace of codimension 2 obtained by intersecting the hyperplanes, and whose angle is twice the angle between the hyperplanes.
In different settings, hyperplanes may have different properties.For instance, a hyperplane of an n-dimensional affine space is a flat subset with dimension n − 1[1] and it separates the space into two half spaces. While a hyperplane of an n-dimensional projective space does not have this property.
In geometry, a hyperplane of an n-dimensional space V is a subspace of dimension n − 1, or equivalently, of codimension 1 in V. The space V may be a Euclidean space or more generally an affine space, or a vector space or a projective space, and the notion of hyperplane varies correspondingly since the definition of subspace differs in these settings; in all cases however, any hyperplane can be given in coordinates as the solution of a single (due to the "codimension 1" constraint) algebraic equation of degree 1.
Projective hyperplanes, are used in projective geometry.A projective subspace is a set of points with the property that for any two points of the set, all the points on the line determined by the two points are contained in the set.[2] Projective geometry can be viewed as affine geometry with vanishing points (points at infinity) added.An affine hyperplane together with the associated points at infinity forms a projective hyperplane.One special case of a projective hyperplane is the infinite or ideal hyperplane, which is defined with the set of all points at infinity.
In machine learning, hyperplanes are a key tool to create support vector machines for such tasks as computer vision and natural language processing.
The datapoint and its predicted value via a linear model is a hyperplane.

Any hyperplane of a Euclidean space has exactly two unit normal vectors.
In geometry, a hyperplane is a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of its ambient space.For example, if a space is 3-dimensional then its hyperplanes are the 2-dimensional planes, while if the space is 2-dimensional, its hyperplanes are the 1-dimensional lines.This notion can be used in any general space in which the concept of the dimension of a subspace is defined.
In a vector space, a vector hyperplane is a subspace of codimension 1, only possibly shifted from the origin by a vector, in which case it is referred to as a flat. Such a hyperplane is the solution of a single linear equation.

If V is a vector space, one distinguishes "vector hyperplanes" (which are linear subspaces, and therefore must pass through the origin) and "affine hyperplanes" (which need not pass through the origin; they can be obtained by translation of a vector hyperplane). A hyperplane in a Euclidean space separates that space into two half spaces, and defines a reflection that fixes the hyperplane and interchanges those two half spaces.
In convex geometry, two disjoint convex sets in n-dimensional Euclidean space are separated by a hyperplane, a result called the hyperplane separation theorem.

Several specific types of hyperplanes are defined with properties that are well suited for particular purposes. Some of these specializations are described here.

Affine hyperplanes are used to define decision boundaries in many machine learning algorithms such as linear-combination (oblique) decision trees, and perceptrons.
Inprojective space, a hyperplane does not divide the space into two parts; rather, it takes two hyperplanes to separate points and divide up the space.The reason for this is that the space essentially "wraps around" so that both sides of a lone hyperplane are connected to each other.

As an example, a point is a hyperplane in 1-dimensional space, a line is a hyperplane in 2-dimensional space, and a plane is a hyperplane in 3-dimensional space. A line in 3-dimensional space is not a hyperplane, and does not separate the space into two parts (the complement of such a line is connected).
A hyperplane H is called a "support" hyperplane of the polyhedron P if P is contained in one of the two closed half-spaces bounded by H and H∩P≠∅{\displaystyle H\cap P\neq \varnothing }.[3] The intersection of P and H is defined to be a "face" of the polyhedron. The theory of polyhedra and the dimension of the faces are analyzed by looking at these intersections involving hyperplanes.

Ultimately, the term fractal dimension became the phrase with which Mandelbrot himself became most comfortable with respect to encapsulating the meaning of the word fractal, a term he created.After several iterations over years, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language:"...to use fractal without a pedantic definition, to use fractal dimension as a generic term applicable to all the variants."[6]

Unlike topological dimensions, the fractal index can take non-integer values,[18] indicating that a set fills its space qualitatively and quantitatively differently from how an ordinary geometrical set does.[1][2][3] For instance, a curve with a fractal dimension very near to 1, say 1.10, behaves quite like an ordinary line, but a curve with fractal dimension 1.9 winds convolutedly through space very nearly like a surface. Similarly, a surface with fractal dimension of 2.1 fills space very much like an ordinary surface, but one with a fractal dimension of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume.[17]: 48 [notes 1] This general relationship can be seen in the two images of fractal curves in Fig.2 and Fig. 3 – the 32-segment contour in Fig. 2, convoluted and space filling, has a fractal dimension of 1.67, compared to the perceptibly less complex Koch curve in Fig. 3, which has a fractal dimension of approximately 1.2619.

A fractal dimension is an index for characterizing fractal patterns or sets by quantifying their complexity as a ratio of the change in detail to the change in scale.[5]: 1  Several types of fractal dimension can be measured theoretically and empirically (see Fig. 2).[3][9] Fractal dimensions are used to characterize a broad spectrum of objects ranging from the abstract[1][3] to practical phenomena, including turbulence,[5]: 97–104  river networks,: 246–247  urban growth,[10][11] human physiology,[12][13] medicine,[9] and market trends.[14] The essential idea of fractional or fractal dimensions has a long history in mathematics that can be traced back to the 1600s,[5]: 19 [15] but the terms fractal and fractal dimension were coined by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975.[1][2][5][9][14][16]

As is the case with dimensions determined for lines, squares, and cubes, fractal dimensions are general descriptors that do not uniquely define patterns.[24][25] The value of D for the Koch fractal discussed above, for instance, quantifies the pattern's inherent scaling, but does not uniquely describe nor provide enough information to reconstruct it. Many fractal structures or patterns could be constructed that have the same scaling relationship but are dramatically different from the Koch curve, as is illustrated in Figure 6.

The terms fractal dimension and fractal were coined by Mandelbrot in 1975,[16] about a decade after he published his paper on self-similarity in the coastline of Britain. Various historical authorities credit him with also synthesizing centuries of complicated theoretical mathematics and engineering work and applying them in a new way to study complex geometries that defied description in usual linear terms.[15][21][22] The earliest roots of what Mandelbrot synthesized as the fractal dimension have been traced clearly back to writings about nondifferentiable, infinitely self-similar functions, which are important in the mathematical definition of fractals, around the time that calculus was discovered in the mid-1600s.[5]: 405  There was a lull in the published work on such functions for a time after that, then a renewal starting in the late 1800s with the publishing of mathematical functions and sets that are today called canonical fractals (such as the eponymous works of von Koch,[19] Sierpiński, and Julia), but at the time of their formulation were often considered antithetical mathematical "monsters".[15][22] These works were accompanied by perhaps the most pivotal point in the development of the concept of a fractal dimension through the work of Hausdorff in the early 1900s who defined a "fractional" dimension that has come to be named after him and is frequently invoked in defining modern fractals.[4][5]: 44 [17][21]

An alternative to a direct measurement, is considering a mathematical model that resembles formation of a real-world fractal object. In this case, a validation can also be done by comparing other than fractal properties implied by the model, with measured data. In colloidal physics, systems composed of particles with various fractal dimensions arise. To describe these systems, it is convenientto speak about a distribution of fractal dimensions, and eventually, a time evolution of the latter: a process that is driven by a complex interplay between aggregation and coalescence.[55]
In mathematics, a fractal dimension is a term invoked in the science of geometry to provide a rational statistical index of complexity detail in a pattern. A fractal pattern changes with the scale at which it is measured. It has also been mythologized as a measure of the space-filling capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently and in a fractal dimension, i.e. one that does not have to be an integer.[1][2][3]

Fractal dimensions were first applied as an index characterizing complicated geometric forms for which the details seemed more important than the gross picture.[16] For sets describing ordinary geometric shapes, the theoretical fractal dimension equals the set's familiar Euclidean or topological dimension. Thus, it is 0 for sets describing points (0-dimensional sets); 1 for sets describing lines (1-dimensional sets having length only); 2 for sets describing surfaces (2-dimensional sets having length and width); and 3 for sets describing volumes (3-dimensional sets having length, width, and height). But this changes for fractal sets. If the theoretical fractal dimension of a set exceeds its topological dimension, the set is considered to have fractal geometry.[17]

The concept of a fractal dimension rests in unconventional views of scaling and dimension.[24] As Fig. 4 illustrates, traditional notions of geometry dictate that shapes scale predictably according to intuitive and familiar ideas about the space they are contained within, such that, for instance, measuring a line using first one measuring stick then another 1/3 its size, will give for the second stick a total length 3 times as many sticks long as with the first. This holds in 2 dimensions, as well. If one measures the area of a square then measures again with a box of side length 1/3 the size of the original, one will find 9 times as many squares as with the first measure. Such familiar scaling relationships can be defined mathematically by the general scaling rule in Equation 1, where the variable N{\displaystyle N} stands for the number of measurement units (sticks, squares, etc.), ε{\displaystyle \varepsilon } for the scaling factor, and D{\displaystyle D} for the fractal dimension:

The concept of fractality is applied increasingly in the field of surface science, providing a bridge between surface characteristics and functional properties.[26] Numerous surface descriptors are used to interpret the structure of nominally flat surfaces, which often exhibit self-affine features across multiple length-scales. Mean surface roughness, usually denoted RA, is the most commonly applied surface descriptor, however numerous other descriptors including mean slope, root mean square roughness (RRMS) and others are regularly applied. It is found however that many physical surface phenomena cannot readily be interpreted with reference to such descriptors, thus fractal dimension is increasingly applied to establish correlations between surface structure in terms of scaling behavior and performance.[27] The fractal dimensions of surfaces have been employed to explain and better understand phenomena in areas of contact mechanics,[28]frictional behavior,[29] electrical contact resistance[30] and transparent conducting oxides.[31]

Many real-world phenomena exhibit limited or statistical fractal properties and fractal dimensions that have been estimated from sampled data using computer based fractal analysis techniques.Practically, measurements of fractal dimension are affected by various methodological issues, and are sensitive to numerical or experimental noise and limitations in the amount of data. Nonetheless, the field is rapidly growing as estimated fractal dimensions for statistically self-similar phenomena may have many practical applications in various fields includingastronomy,[34] acoustics,[35][36] geology and earth sciences,[37] diagnostic imaging,[38][39][40]ecology,[41]electrochemical processes,[42]image analysis,[43][44][45][46]biology and medicine,[47][48][49]neuroscience,[50][13]network analysis,physiology,[12]physics,[51][52] and Riemann zeta zeros.[53] Fractal dimension estimates have also been shown to correlate with Lempel-Ziv complexity in real-world data sets from psychoacoustics and neuroscience.[54][35]

One non-trivial example is the fractal dimension of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but it is by no means rectifiable: the length of the curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional.[7] Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which is often a number between one and two; in the case of the Koch snowflake, it is approximately 1.2619.

The concept of fractal dimension described in this article is a basic view of a complicated construct. The examples discussed here were chosen for clarity, and the scaling unit and ratios were known ahead of time. In practice, however, fractal dimensions can be determined using techniques that approximate scaling and detail from limits estimated from regression lines over log vs log plots of size vs scale. Several formal mathematical definitions of different types of fractal dimension are listed below. Although for compact sets with exact affine self-similarity all these dimensions coincide, in general they are not equivalent:

Of note, images shown in this page are not true fractals because the scaling described by D{\displaystyle D} cannot continue past the point of their smallest component, a pixel. However, the theoretical patterns that the images represent have no discrete pixel-like pieces, but rather are composed of an infinite number of infinitely scaled segments and do indeed have the claimed fractal dimensions.[5][24]

The relationship of an increasing fractal dimension with space-filling might be taken to mean fractal dimensions measure density, but that is not so; the two are not strictly correlated.[8] Instead, a fractal dimension measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity.[notes 2] These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with topological dimension of 1, so one might hope to be able to measure their length and derivative in the same way as with ordinary curves. But we cannot do either of these things, because fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary curves lack.[5] The self-similarity lies in the infinite scaling, and the detail in the defining elements of each set. The length between any two points on these curves is infinite, no matter how close together the two points are, which means that it is impossible to approximate the length of such a curve by partitioning the curve into many small segments.[19] Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look exactly like the first iteration. These are not rectifiable curves, meaning they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be meaningfully characterized by finding their lengths and derivatives. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.

The same rule applies to fractal geometry but less intuitively. To elaborate, a fractal line measured at first to be one length, when remeasured using a new stick scaled by 1/3 of the old may be 4 times as many scaled sticks long rather than the expected 3 (see Fig. 5). In this case, N=4{\displaystyle N=4} when ε=13,{\displaystyle \varepsilon ={\tfrac {1}{3}},} and the value of D{\displaystyle D} can be found by rearranging Equation 1:

The two fractal curves described above show a type of self-similarity that is exact with a repeating unit of detail that is readily visualized. This sort of structure can be extended to other spaces (e.g., a fractal that extends the Koch curve into 3-d space has a theoretical D=2.5849). However, such neatly countable complexity is only one example of the self-similarity and detail that are present in fractals.[3][14] The example of the coast line of Britain, for instance, exhibits self-similarity of an approximate pattern with approximate scaling.[5]: 26  Overall, fractals show several types and degrees of self-similarity and detail that may not be easily visualized. These include, as examples, strange attractors for which the detail has been described as in essence, smooth portions piling up,[17]: 49  the Julia set, which can be seen to be complex swirls upon swirls, and heart rates, which are patterns of rough spikes repeated and scaled in time.[20] Fractal complexity may not always be resolvable into easily grasped units of detail and scale without complex analytic methods but it is still quantifiable through fractal dimensions.[5]: 197, 262

The main idea of "fractured" dimensions has a long history in mathematics, but the term itself was brought to the fore by Benoit Mandelbrot based on his 1967 paper on self-similarity in which he discussed fractional dimensions.[4] In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by Lewis Fry Richardson describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline's measured length changes with the length of the measuring stick used (see Fig. 1). In terms of that notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick.[5] There are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale: see the section Examples.

A highly symmetric way to construct a regular n-simplex is to use a representation of the cyclic group Zn+1 by orthogonal matrices. This is an n × n orthogonal matrix Q such that Qn+1 = I is the identity matrix, but no lower power of Q is. Applying powers of this matrix to an appropriate vector v will produce the vertices of a regular n-simplex. To carry this out, first observe that for any orthogonal matrix Q, there is a choice of basis in which Q is a block diagonal matrix
Applying this to the vector (1, 0, 1, 0) results in the simplex whose vertices are

One way to write down a regular n-simplex in Rn is to choose two points to be the first two vertices, choose a third point to make an equilateral triangle, choose a fourth point to make a regular tetrahedron, and so on. Each step requires satisfying equations that ensure that each newly chosen vertex, together with the previously chosen vertices, forms a regular simplex. There are several sets of equations that can be written down and used for this purpose. These include the equality of all the distances between vertices; the equality of all the distances from vertices to the center of the simplex; the fact that the angle subtended through the new vertex by any two previously chosen vertices is π/3{\displaystyle \pi /3}; and the fact that the angle subtended through the center of the simplex by any two vertices is arccos⁡(−1/n){\displaystyle \arccos(-1/n)}.

For a 2-simplex the theorem is the Pythagorean theorem for triangles with a right angle and for a 3-simplex it is de Gua's theorem for a tetrahedron with an orthogonal corner.
In some conventions,[7] the empty set is defined to be a (−1)-simplex. The definition of the simplex above still makes sense if n = −1. This convention is more common in applications to algebraic topology (such as simplicial homology) than to the study of polytopes.
The above regular n-simplex is not centered on the origin. It can be translated to the origin by subtracting the mean of its vertices. By rescaling, it can be given unit side length. This results in the simplex whose vertices are:
Topologically, an n-simplex is equivalent to an n-ball. Every n-simplex is an n-dimensional manifold with corners.

If P is a general parallelotope, the same assertions hold except that it is no longer true, in dimension > 2, that the simplexes need to be pairwise congruent; yet their volumes remain equal, because the n-parallelotope is the image of the unit n-hypercube by the linear isomorphism that sends the canonical basis of Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} to e1,…,en{\displaystyle e_{1},\ldots ,e_{n}}. As previously, this implies that the volume of a simplex coming from a n-path is:
An "orthogonal corner" means here that there is a vertex at which all adjacent edges are pairwise orthogonal. It immediately follows that all adjacent faces are pairwise orthogonal.

Either of these, together with the standard basis vectors, yields a regular n-simplex.
A derivation of a very similar formula can be found in Stein, P. (1966). "A Note on the Volume of a Simplex". American Mathematical Monthly. 73 (3): 299–301. doi:10.2307/2315353. JSTOR 2315353.
Conversely, given an n-simplex (v0, v1, v2,…vn){\displaystyle (v_{0},\ v_{1},\ v_{2},\ldots v_{n})} of Rn{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}}, it can be supposed that the vectors e1=v1−v0, e2=v2−v1,…en=vn−vn−1{\displaystyle e_{1}=v_{1}-v_{0},\ e_{2}=v_{2}-v_{1},\ldots e_{n}=v_{n}-v_{n-1}} form a basis of Rn{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}}. Considering the parallelotope constructed from v0{\displaystyle v_{0}} and e1,…,en{\displaystyle e_{1},\ldots ,e_{n}}, one sees that the previous formula is valid for every simplex.
By using the same definitions as for the classical n-simplex, the n-simplices for different dimensions n assemble into one simplicial object, while the rings R[Δn]{\displaystyle R[\Delta ^{n}]} assemble into one cosimplicial object R[Δ∙]{\displaystyle R[\Delta ^{\bullet }]} (in the category of schemes resp. rings, since the face and degeneracy maps are all polynomial).

In industrial statistics, simplices arise in problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In the design of bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such mixtures, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, in which case the feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using response surface methodology, and then a local maximum can be computed using a nonlinear programming method, such as sequential quadratic programming.[17]
In some approaches to quantum gravity, such as Regge calculus and causal dynamical triangulations, simplices are used as building blocks of discretizations of spacetime; that is, to build simplicial manifolds.
More formally, an (n + 1)-simplex can be constructed as a join (∨ operator) of an n-simplex and a point, ( ). An (m + n + 1)-simplex can be constructed as a join of an m-simplex and an n-simplex. The two simplices are oriented to be completely normal from each other, with translation in a direction orthogonal to both of them. A 1-simplex is the join of two points: ( ) ∨ ( ) = 2 ⋅ ( ). A general 2-simplex (scalene triangle) is the join of three points: ( ) ∨ ( ) ∨ ( ). An isosceles triangle is the join of a 1-simplex and a point: { } ∨ ( ). An equilateral triangle is 3 ⋅ ( ) or {3}. A general 3-simplex is the join of 4 points: ( ) ∨ ( ) ∨ ( ) ∨ ( ). A 3-simplex with mirror symmetry can be expressed as the join of an edge and two points: { } ∨ ( ) ∨ ( ). A 3-simplex with triangular symmetry can be expressed as the join of an equilateral triangle and 1 point: 3.( )∨( ) or {3}∨( ). A regular tetrahedron is 4 ⋅ ( ) or {3,3} and so on.
The simplex Δn lies in the affine hyperplane obtained by removing the restriction ti ≥ 0 in the above definition.
It is also possible to directly write down a particular regular n-simplex in Rn which can then be translated, rotated, and scaled as desired. One way to do this is as follows. Denote the basis vectors of Rn by e1 through en. Begin with the standard (n − 1)-simplex which is the convex hull of the basis vectors. By adding an additional vertex, these become a face of a regular n-simplex. The additional vertex must lie on the line perpendicular to the barycenter of the standard simplex, so it has the form (α/n, ..., α/n) for some real number α. Since the squared distance between two basis vectors is 2, in order for the additional vertex to form a regular n-simplex, the squared distance between it and any of the basis vectors must also be 2. This yields a quadratic equation for α. Solving this equation shows that there are two choices for the additional vertex:
Δ∗n={(s1,…,sn)∈Rn∣0=s0≤s1≤s2≤⋯≤sn≤sn+1=1}.{\displaystyle \Delta _{*}^{n}=\left\{(s_{1},\ldots ,s_{n})\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}\mid 0=s_{0}\leq s_{1}\leq s_{2}\leq \dots \leq s_{n}\leq s_{n+1}=1\right\}.}
In operations research, linear programming problems can be solved by the simplex algorithm of George Dantzig.
The convex hull of any nonempty subset of the n + 1 points that define an n-simplex is called a face of the simplex. Faces are simplices themselves. In particular, the convex hull of a subset of size m + 1 (of the n + 1 defining points) is an m-simplex, called an m-face of the n-simplex. The 0-faces (i.e., the defining points themselves as sets of size 1) are called the vertices (singular: vertex), the 1-faces are called the edges, the (n − 1)-faces are called the facets, and the sole n-face is the whole n-simplex itself. In general, the number of m-faces is equal to the binomial coefficient (n+1m+1){\displaystyle {\tbinom {n+1}{m+1}}}.[5] Consequently, the number of m-faces of an n-simplex may be found in column (m + 1) of row (n + 1) of Pascal's triangle. A simplex A is a coface of a simplex B if B is a face of A. Face and facet can have different meanings when describing types of simplices in a simplicial complex; see simplicial complex for more detail.

The concept of a simplex was known to William Kingdon Clifford, who wrote about these shapes in 1886 but called them "prime confines". Henri Poincaré, writing about algebraic topology in 1900, called them "generalized tetrahedra".In 1902 Pieter Hendrik Schoute described the concept first with the Latin superlative simplicissimum ("simplest") and then with the same Latin adjective in the normal form simplex ("simple").[3]

A regular simplex[1] is a simplex that is also a regular polytope. A regular k-simplex may be constructed from a regular (k − 1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.
There is a canonical map from the standard n-simplex to an arbitrary n-simplex with vertices (v0, ..., vn) given by
(cos⁡(2π/5)−sin⁡(2π/5)00sin⁡(2π/5)cos⁡(2π/5)0000cos⁡(4π/5)−sin⁡(4π/5)00sin⁡(4π/5)cos⁡(4π/5)).{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}\cos(2\pi /5)&-\sin(2\pi /5)&0&0\\\sin(2\pi /5)&\cos(2\pi /5)&0&0\\0&0&\cos(4\pi /5)&-\sin(4\pi /5)\\0&0&\sin(4\pi /5)&\cos(4\pi /5)\end{pmatrix}}.}
In statistics, simplices are sample spaces of compositional data and are also used in plotting quantities that sum to 1, such as proportions of subpopulations, as in a ternary plot.
In geometry, a simplex (plural: simplexes or simplices) is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. The simplex is so-named because it represents the simplest possible polytope in any given dimension.For example,

Geometrically, this is an n-dimensional subset of Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} (maximal dimension, codimension 0) rather than of Rn+1{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}} (codimension 1). The facets, which on the standard simplex correspond to one coordinate vanishing, ti=0,{\displaystyle t_{i}=0,} here correspond to successive coordinates being equal, si=si+1,{\displaystyle s_{i}=s_{i+1},} while the interior corresponds to the inequalities becoming strict (increasing sequences).
(so there are n! n-paths and vn{\displaystyle v_{n}} does not depend on the permutation). The following assertions hold:
From this formula, it follows immediately that the volume under a standard n-simplex (i.e. between the origin and the simplex in Rn+1) is

This yields an n-simplex as a corner of the n-cube, and is a standard orthogonal simplex. This is the simplex used in the simplex method, which is based at the origin, and locally models a vertex on a polytope with n facets.
^ A derivation of a very similar formula can be found in Stein, P. (1966). "A Note on the Volume of a Simplex". American Mathematical Monthly. 73 (3): 299–301. doi:10.2307/2315353. JSTOR 2315353.
Another common way of computing the volume of the simplex is via the Cayley–Menger determinant, which works even when the n-simplex's vertices are in a Euclidean space with more than n dimensions.[11]

The n-simplex is also the vertex figure of the (n + 1)-hypercube. It is also the facet of the (n + 1)-orthoplex.
The n + 1 vertices of the standard n-simplex are the points ei ∈ Rn+1, where
A commonly used function from Rn to the interior of the standard (n−1){\displaystyle (n-1)}-simplex is the softmax function, or normalized exponential function; this generalizes the standard logistic function.

Since classical algebraic geometry allows one to talk about polynomial equations but not inequalities, the algebraic standard n-simplex is commonly defined as the subset of affine (n + 1)-dimensional space, where all coordinates sum up to 1 (thus leaving out the inequality part). The algebraic description of this set is

The volume of an n-simplex in n-dimensional space with vertices (v0, ..., vn) is
The standard n-simplex (or unit n-simplex) is the subset of Rn+1 given by
In geometric design and computer graphics, many methods first perform simplicial triangulations of the domain and then fit interpolating polynomials to each simplex.[18]
Two 5-cells form a compound of two 5-cells in four dimensions.
An alternative coordinate system is given by taking the indefinite sum:
each of which has distance √5 from the others.When n is odd, the condition means that exactly one of the diagonal blocks is 1 × 1, equal to −1, and acts upon a non-zero entry of v; while the remaining diagonal blocks, say Q1, ..., Q(n − 1) / 2, are 2 × 2, there is an equality of sets
where the ai{\displaystyle a_{i}} are the integers denoting orientation and multiplicity. For the boundary operator ∂{\displaystyle \partial }, one has:
The coefficients ti are called the barycentric coordinates of a point in the n-simplex. Such a general simplex is often called an affine n-simplex, to emphasize that the canonical map is an affine transformation. It is also sometimes called an oriented affine n-simplex to emphasize that the canonical map may be orientation preserving or reversing.
^ Every n-path corresponding to a permutation σ{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \sigma } is the image of the n-path v0, v0+e1, v0+e1+e2,…v0+e1+⋯+en{\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0},\ v_{0}+e_{1},\ v_{0}+e_{1}+e_{2},\ldots v_{0}+e_{1}+\cdots +e_{n}} by the affine isometry that sends v0{\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0}} to v0{\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0}}, and whose linear part matches ei{\displaystyle \scriptstyle e_{i}} to eσ(i){\displaystyle \scriptstyle e_{\sigma (i)}} for all i. hence every two n-paths are isometric, and so is their convex hulls; this explains the congruence of the simplexes. To show the other assertions, it suffices to remark that the interior of the simplex determined by the n-path v0, v0+eσ(1), v0+eσ(1)+eσ(2)…v0+eσ(1)+⋯+eσ(n){\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0},\ v_{0}+e_{\sigma (1)},\ v_{0}+e_{\sigma (1)}+e_{\sigma (2)}\ldots v_{0}+e_{\sigma (1)}+\cdots +e_{\sigma (n)}} is the set of points v0+(x1+⋯+xn)eσ(1)+⋯+(xn−1+xn)eσ(n−1)+xneσ(n){\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0}+(x_{1}+\cdots +x_{n})e_{\sigma (1)}+\cdots +(x_{n-1}+x_{n})e_{\sigma (n-1)}+x_{n}e_{\sigma (n)}}, with 0<xi<1{\displaystyle \scriptstyle 0<x_{i}<1} and x1+⋯+xn<1.{\displaystyle \scriptstyle x_{1}+\cdots +x_{n}<1.} Hence the components of these points with respect to each corresponding permuted basis are strictly ordered in the decreasing order. That explains why the simplexes are non-overlapping. The fact that the union of the simplexes is the whole unit n-hypercube follows as well, replacing the strict inequalities above by "≤{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \leq }". The same arguments are also valid for a general parallelotope, except the isometry between the simplexes.
Specifically, a k-simplex is a k-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its k + 1 vertices. More formally, suppose the k + 1 points u0,…,uk{\displaystyle u_{0},\dots ,u_{k}} are affinely independent, which means that the k vectors u1−u0,…,uk−u0{\displaystyle u_{1}-u_{0},\dots ,u_{k}-u_{0}} are linearly independent.Then, the simplex determined by them is the set of points
Any two (n − 1)-dimensional faces of a regular n-dimensional simplex are themselves regular (n − 1)-dimensional simplices, and they have the same dihedral angle of cos−1(1/n).[13][14]
Likewise, the boundary of the boundary of a chain is zero: ∂2ρ=0{\displaystyle \partial ^{2}\rho =0}.
Every n-path corresponding to a permutation σ{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \sigma } is the image of the n-path v0, v0+e1, v0+e1+e2,…v0+e1+⋯+en{\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0},\ v_{0}+e_{1},\ v_{0}+e_{1}+e_{2},\ldots v_{0}+e_{1}+\cdots +e_{n}} by the affine isometry that sends v0{\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0}} to v0{\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0}}, and whose linear part matches ei{\displaystyle \scriptstyle e_{i}} to eσ(i){\displaystyle \scriptstyle e_{\sigma (i)}} for all i. hence every two n-paths are isometric, and so is their convex hulls; this explains the congruence of the simplexes. To show the other assertions, it suffices to remark that the interior of the simplex determined by the n-path v0, v0+eσ(1), v0+eσ(1)+eσ(2)…v0+eσ(1)+⋯+eσ(n){\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0},\ v_{0}+e_{\sigma (1)},\ v_{0}+e_{\sigma (1)}+e_{\sigma (2)}\ldots v_{0}+e_{\sigma (1)}+\cdots +e_{\sigma (n)}} is the set of points v0+(x1+⋯+xn)eσ(1)+⋯+(xn−1+xn)eσ(n−1)+xneσ(n){\displaystyle \scriptstyle v_{0}+(x_{1}+\cdots +x_{n})e_{\sigma (1)}+\cdots +(x_{n-1}+x_{n})e_{\sigma (n-1)}+x_{n}e_{\sigma (n)}}, with 0<xi<1{\displaystyle \scriptstyle 0<x_{i}<1} and x1+⋯+xn<1.{\displaystyle \scriptstyle x_{1}+\cdots +x_{n}<1.} Hence the components of these points with respect to each corresponding permuted basis are strictly ordered in the decreasing order. That explains why the simplexes are non-overlapping. The fact that the union of the simplexes is the whole unit n-hypercube follows as well, replacing the strict inequalities above by "≤{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \leq }". The same arguments are also valid for a general parallelotope, except the isometry between the simplexes.
Δ4 is the regular 5-cell with vertices (1, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 0, 0, 1) in R5.
More generally, a simplex (and a chain) can be embedded into a manifold by means of smooth, differentiable map f:Rn→M{\displaystyle f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to M}. In this case, both the summation convention for denoting the set, and the boundary operation commute with the embedding. That is,
More generally, there is a canonical map from the standard (n−1){\displaystyle (n-1)}-simplex (with n vertices) onto any polytope with n vertices, given by the same equation (modifying indexing):
A key distinction between these presentations is the behavior under permuting coordinates – the standard simplex is stabilized by permuting coordinates, while permuting elements of the "ordered simplex" do not leave it invariant, as permuting an ordered sequence generally makes it unordered. Indeed, the ordered simplex is a (closed) fundamental domain for the action of the symmetric group on the n-cube, meaning that the orbit of the ordered simplex under the n! elements of the symmetric group divides the n-cube into n!{\displaystyle n!} mostly disjoint simplices (disjoint except for boundaries), showing that this simplex has volume 1/n!{\displaystyle 1/n!} Alternatively, the volume can be computed by an iterated integral, whose successive integrands are 1,x,x2/2,x3/3!,…,xn/n!{\displaystyle 1,x,x^{2}/2,x^{3}/3!,\dots ,x^{n}/n!}
Finally, a simple variant is to replace "summing to 1" with "summing to at most 1"; this raises the dimension by 1, so to simplify notation, the indexing changes:
The regular simplex family is the first of three regular polytope families, labeled by Donald Coxeter as αn, the other two being the cross-polytope family, labeled as βn, and the hypercubes, labeled as γn. A fourth family, the tessellation of n-dimensional space by infinitely many hypercubes, he labeled as δn.[4]

Without the 1/n! it is the formula for the volume of an n-parallelotope. This can be understood as follows: Assume that P is an n-parallelotope constructed on a basis (v0,e1,…,en){\displaystyle (v_{0},e_{1},\ldots ,e_{n})} of Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}.Given a permutation σ{\displaystyle \sigma } of {1,2,…,n}{\displaystyle \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}}, call a list of vertices v0, v1,…,vn{\displaystyle v_{0},\ v_{1},\ldots ,v_{n}} a n-path if
Finally, the formula at the beginning of this section is obtained by observing that
Two tetrahedra form a compound of two tetrahedra or stella octangula.
A continuous map f:σ→X{\displaystyle f:\sigma \to X} to a topological space X is frequently referred to as a singular n-simplex. (A map is generally called "singular" if it fails to have some desirable property such as continuity and, in this case, the term is meant to reflect to the fact that the continuous map need not be an embedding.)[16]
where ρ is a chain. The boundary operation commutes with the mapping because, in the end, the chain is defined as a set and little more, and the set operation always commutes with the map operation (by definition of a map).
In topology and combinatorics, it is common to "glue together" simplices to form a simplicial complex. The associated combinatorial structure is called an abstract simplicial complex, in which context the word "simplex" simply means any finite set of vertices.
For the vector (1, 0, 1/√2), the resulting simplex has vertices
and, for every Qi, the entries of v upon which Qi acts are not both zero. For example, when n = 4, one possible matrix is
A further property of this presentation is that it uses the order but not addition, and thus can be defined in any dimension over any ordered set, and for example can be used to define an infinite-dimensional simplex without issues of convergence of sums.
In probability theory, the points of the standard n-simplex in (n + 1)-space form the space of possible probability distributions on a finite set consisting of n + 1 possible outcomes. The correspondence is as follows: For each distribution described as an ordered (n + 1)-tuple of probabilities whose sum is (necessarily) 1, we associate the point of the simplex whose barycentric coordinates are precisely those probabilities. That is, the kth vertex of the simplex is assigned to have the kth probability of the (n + 1)-tuple as its barycentric coefficient. This correspondence is an affine homeomorphism.
as can be seen by multiplying the previous formula by xn+1, to get the volume under the n-simplex as a function of its vertex distance x from the origin, differentiating with respect to x, at x=1/2{\displaystyle x=1/{\sqrt {2}}}  (where the n-simplex side length is 1), and normalizing by the length dx/n+1{\displaystyle dx/{\sqrt {n+1}}} of the increment, (dx/(n+1),…,dx/(n+1)){\displaystyle (dx/(n+1),\ldots ,dx/(n+1))}, along the normal vector.

A more symmetric way to compute the volume of an n-simplex in Rn{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is
In layman's terms, an n-simplex is a simple shape (a polygon) that requires n dimensions. Consider a line segment AB as a "shape" in a 1-dimensional space (the 1-dimensional space is the line in which the segment lies). One can place a new point C somewhere off the line. The new shape, triangle ABC, requires two dimensions; it cannot fit in the original 1-dimensional space. The triangle is the 2-simplex, a simple shape that requires two dimensions. Consider a triangle ABC, a shape in a 2-dimensional space (the plane in which the triangle resides). One can place a new point D somewhere off the plane. The new shape, tetrahedron ABCD, requires three dimensions; it cannot fit in the original 2-dimensional space. The tetrahedron is the 3-simplex, a simple shape that requires three dimensions. Consider tetrahedron ABCD, a shape in a 3-dimensional space (the 3-space in which the tetrahedron lies). One can place a new point E somewhere outside the 3-space. The new shape ABCDE, called a 5-cell, requires four dimensions and is called the 4-simplex; it cannot fit in the original 3-dimensional space. (It also cannot be visualized easily.) This idea can be generalized, that is, adding a single new point outside the currently occupied space, which requires going to the next higher dimension to hold the new shape. This idea can also be worked backward: the line segment we started with is a simple shape that requires a 1-dimensional space to hold it; the line segment is the 1-simplex. The line segment itself was formed by starting with a single point in 0-dimensional space (this initial point is the 0-simplex) and adding a second point, which required the increase to 1-dimensional space.
Since all simplices are self-dual, they can form a series of compounds;
The side length of this simplex is 2(n+1)/n{\textstyle {\sqrt {2(n+1)/n}}}.
In algebraic topology, simplices are used as building blocks to construct an interesting class of topological spaces called simplicial complexes. These spaces are built from simplices glued together in a combinatorial fashion. Simplicial complexes are used to define a certain kind of homology called simplicial homology.
In chemistry, the hydrides of most elements in the p-block can resemble a simplex if one is to connect each atom. Neon does not react with hydrogen and as such is a point, fluorine bonds with one hydrogen atom and forms a line segment, oxygen bonds with two hydrogen atoms in a bent fashion resembling a triangle, nitrogen reacts to form a tetrahedron, and carbon forms a structure resembling a Schlegel diagram of the 5-cell. This trend continues for the heavier analogues of each element, as well as if the hydrogen atom is replaced by a halogen atom.

where each Qi is orthogonal and either 2 × 2 or 1 × 1. In order for Q to have order n + 1, all of these matrices must have order dividing n + 1. Therefore each Qi is either a 1 × 1 matrix whose only entry is 1 or, if n is odd, −1; or it is a 2 × 2 matrix of the form

Note that there are two sets of vertices described here. One set uses +{\displaystyle +} in each calculation. The other set uses −{\displaystyle -} in each calculation.
This can be seen by noting that the center of the standard simplex is (1n+1,…,1n+1){\textstyle \left({\frac {1}{n+1}},\dots ,{\frac {1}{n+1}}\right)}, and the centers of its faces are coordinate permutations of (0,1n,…,1n){\textstyle \left(0,{\frac {1}{n}},\dots ,{\frac {1}{n}}\right)}. Then, by symmetry, the vector pointing from (1n+1,…,1n+1){\textstyle \left({\frac {1}{n+1}},\dots ,{\frac {1}{n+1}}\right)} to (0,1n,…,1n){\textstyle \left(0,{\frac {1}{n}},\dots ,{\frac {1}{n}}\right)} is perpendicular to the faces. So the vectors normal to the faces are permutations of (−n,1,…,1){\displaystyle (-n,1,\dots ,1)}, from which the dihedral angles are calculated.
The number of 1-faces (edges) of the n-simplex is the n-th triangle number, the number of 2-faces of the n-simplex is the (n − 1)th tetrahedron number, the number of 3-faces of the n-simplex is the (n − 2)th 5-cell number, and so on.
