The Steadfast is the ship of Princess Eloise and Prince Alexander.
According to Mike Nawrocki, the ship has different sets. This included the ship itself, the deck, and the rooms. The reason why they did this is because they didn't want to be too complex like what they did with the pirate ship from Jonah, where it was it done in one set.

Steadfast is one of two albums recorded by American jazz pianist John Hicks during his first studio session as leader in 1975. It was ultimately released on the Strata-East and Bellaphon Records labels in 1991.[1][2][3]
Hicks's material covers "decades-old standards, time-tested jazz works and his own [...] originals".[4] Critic Ken Dryden wrote that Hicks was "at the top of his game, with an excellent instrument and engineer in a London studio".[4]

On 21 September 1978, Douglas DC-3 N407D of Argosy Airlines crashed into the Caribbean Sea whilst on a ferry flight from Fort Lauderdale International Airport to José Martí International Airport, Havana. All four people on board were killed.[2] The aircraft disappeared off radar screens at 12:43 local time (17:43 UTC). A search was initiated, which Steadfast coordinated, but was called off on 24 September without any trace of N407D being found.[3]

Since commissioning in 1968, Steadfast has completed over 330 Search and Rescue cases, interdicted over 1.6 million pounds of marijuana and 27,700 pounds of cocaine, seized over 65 vessels, and stopped over 3500 undocumented migrants on the high seas from entering the United States. Steadfast was the first, and is one of only two cutters awarded the gold marijuana leaf, symbolizing one million pounds of marijuana seized. Legend holds Steadfast was named "El Tiburón Blanco" (Spanish for "The White Shark") by Colombian drug smugglers in the 1970s for being such a nemesis to their illegal drug operations. Steadfast's crew uses the symbol of "El Tiburón Blanco" as one of their logos to epitomize Steadfast's aggressive law enforcement posture.[1]
