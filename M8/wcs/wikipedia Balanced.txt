While the "corporate scorecard" terminology was coined by Art Schneiderman, the roots of performance management as an activity run deep in management literature and practice.Management historians such as Alfred Chandler suggest the origins of performance management can be seen in the emergence of the complex organisation – most notably during the 19th Century in the USA.[13]More recent influences may include the pioneering work of General Electric on performance measurement reporting in the 1950s and the work of French process engineers (who created the tableau de bord – literally, a "dashboard" of performance measures) in the early part of the 20th century.[8]The tool also draws strongly on the ideas of the 'resource based view of the firm'[14] proposed by Edith Penrose. None of these influences is explicitly linked to in the original descriptions of balanced scorecard by Schneiderman, Maisel, or Kaplan & Norton.

Balanced scorecard is also linked to quality management tools and activities.[36]Although there are clear areas of cross-over and association, the two sets of tools are complementary rather than duplicative.[37]

These steps go far beyond the simple task of identifying a small number of financial and non-financial measures, but illustrate the requirement for whatever design process is used to fit within broader thinking about how the resulting balanced scorecard will integrate with the wider business management process.
A balanced scorecard is a strategy performance management tool – a well structured report, that can be used by managers to keep track of the execution of activities by the staff within their control and to monitor the consequences arising from these actions.[1]
Kaplan and Norton's first book[12] remains their most popular. The book reflects the earliest incarnations of balanced scorecards – effectively restating the concept as described in the second Harvard Business Review article.[11]Their second book, The Strategy Focused Organization,[15] echoed work by others (particularly a book published the year before by Olve et al. in Scandinavia[16]) on the value of visually documenting the links between measures by proposing the "Strategic Linkage Model" or strategy map.

Design of a balanced scorecard is about the identification of a small number of financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations'. By alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead.[39]

Theorists have argued from the earliest days of discussion of Balanced Scorecard usage that much of the benefit of the balanced scorecard comes from the design process itself.[8][47]Indeed, it is argued that many failures in the early days of balanced scorecard could be attributed to this problem, in that early balanced scorecards were often designed remotely by consultants[47] – it is suggested that because they were not being involved in the design the managers who were intended to use the device did not trust its design (e.g. it measured the wrong things and used inappropriate targets) and so failed to engage with and use the devices.[28][7]

There are relatively few reliable assessments of the effectiveness of the approaches embodied in Balanced Scorecard, but some studies demonstrate a link between the use of balanced scorecards and better decision making or improved financial performance of companies.[55] Broadcast surveys of usage have difficulties in this respect, due to the wide variations in definition of 'what a balanced scorecard is' (making it hard to work out in a survey if you are comparing like with like).[1]Single organization case studies suffer from the 'lack of a control' issue common to any study of organizational change – what the organization would have achieved if the change had not been made isn't known, so it is difficult to attribute changes observed over time to a single intervention (such as introducing a balanced scorecard).However, such studies as have been done have typically found Balanced Scorecard to be useful.[8][28]
It is important to recognize that the balanced scorecard by definition is not a complex thing – typically no more than about 20 measures spread across a mix of financial and non-financial topics, and easily reported manually (on paper, or using simple office software).[51]
Lack of an overall score: The second kind of criticism is that the balanced scorecard does not provide an overall score or a unified view of performance with clear recommendations: it is simply a list of metrics that managers have to interpret before deciding upon appropriate interventions (e.g. Jensen 2001[50]).These critics usually include in their criticism suggestions about how an 'unanswered' question they identify in their commentary could be answered, but typically the unanswered question relate to things outside the scope of balanced scorecard itself (such as developing strategies) (e.g. Brignall[25])
These suggestions were notably triggered by a recognition that different but equivalent headings would yield alternative sets of measures, and this represents the major design challenge faced with this type of balanced scorecard design: justifying the choice of measures made. "Of all the measures you could have chosen, why did you choose these?"These issues contribute to dis-satisfaction with early Balanced Scorecard designs, since if users are not confident that the measures within the Balanced Scorecard are well chosen, they will have less confidence in the information it provides.[42]

Third generation balanced scorecards improved the utility of second generation of balanced scorecards, giving more relevance and functionality to strategic objectives. The major difference is the incorporation of Destination Statements. Other key components are strategic objectives, strategic linkage model and perspectives, measures and initiatives.[7]

Organizations have used systems consisting of a mix of financial and non-financial measures to track progress for quite some time.[8]One such system was created by Art Schneiderman in 1987 at Analog Devices, a mid-sized semi-conductor company; the Analog Devices Balanced Scorecard.[4]Schneiderman's design was similar to what is now recognised as a "First Generation" Balanced Scorecard design.[7]
Financial: encourages the identification of a few relevant high-level financial measures.In particular, designers were encouraged to choose measures that helped inform the answer to the question "How do we look to shareholders?" Examples: cash flow, sales growth, operating income, return on equity.[40]

In this modified version of balanced scorecard design, managers select a few strategic objectives within each of the perspectives, and then define the cause-effect chain among these objectives by drawing links between them to create a "strategic linkage model".A balanced scorecard of strategic performance measures is then derived directly by selecting one or two measures for each strategic objective.[7] This type of approach provides greater contextual justification for the measures chosen, and is generally easier for managers to work through.This style of balanced scorecard has been commonly used since 1996 or so: it is significantly different in approach to the methods originally proposed, and so can be thought of as representing the "2nd generation" of design approach adopted for the balanced scorecard since its introduction.

In 1997, Kurtzman[44] found that 64 percent of the companies questioned were measuring performance from a number of perspectives in a similar way to the balanced scorecard. Balanced scorecards have been implemented by government agencies, military units, business units and corporations as a whole, non-profit organizations, and schools.

The original thinking behind a balanced scorecard was for it to be focused on information relating to the implementation of a strategy, and over time there has been a blurring of the boundaries between conventional strategic planning and control activities and those required to design a balanced scorecard. This is illustrated well by the four steps required to design a balanced scorecard included in Kaplan & Norton's writing on the subject in the late 1990s:

The idea was that managers used these perspective headings to prompt the selection of a small number of measures that informed on that aspect of the organisation's strategic performance.[5]The perspective headings show that Kaplan and Norton were thinking about the needs of non-divisional commercial organisations in their initial design.These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations,[21] or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997),[22] Ahn (2001),[23] Elefalke (2001),[24] Brignall (2002),[25] Irwin (2002),[26] Flamholtz (2003),[41] Radnor et al. (2003)[27]).
Variants that feature adaptations of the structure of balanced scorecard to suit better a particular viewpoint or agenda are numerous. Examples of the focus of such adaptations include the triple bottom line,[25] decision support,[32] public sector management,[33] and health care management.[34]The performance management elements of the UN's Results Based Management system have strong design and structural similarities to those used in the 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard design approach.[35]
Lack of rigour: The first kind of criticism focuses on the empirical nature of the framework and the lack of any formal validation of the ideas it is based on in the early articles that introduced the concept. Kaplan and Norton notoriously failed to include any citations of earlier articles in their initial papers on the topic,[5][11] an absence noted, for example, by Norreklit.[48]Others identified technical flaws in the methods and design of the original balanced scorecard [28][47][49] or concerning the lack of validation for the approach – for example Flamholtz observed that no validation was provided for the choice of the "four perspectives" of the 1st Generation design:[41]
As the title of Kaplan and Norton's second book[15] highlights, even by 2000 the focus of attention among thought-leaders was moving from the design of Balanced Scorecards themselves, towards the use of Balanced Scorecard as a focal point within a more comprehensive strategic management system.Subsequent writing on Balanced Scorecard by Kaplan & Norton has focused on uses of Balanced Scorecard rather than its design (e.g. "The Execution Premium" in 2008,[17] "Intelligent Design of Inclusive Growth Strategies" in 2019[18]); many others also continue to refine the device itself (e.g. Abernethy et al.[19]).
a focused set of measurements to monitor performance against objectives;
In the mid-1990s, an improved design method emerged.[16] In the new method, measures are selected based on a set of "strategic objectives" plotted on a "strategic linkage model" or "strategy map". With this modified approach, the strategic objectives are distributed across the four measurement perspectives, so as to "connect the dots" to form a visual presentation of strategy and measures.[43]

Since the balanced scorecard was popularized in the early 1990s, a large number of alternatives to the original 'four box' balanced scorecard promoted by Kaplan and Norton[5] in their various articles and books have emerged.Most have very limited application, and are typically proposed either by academics as vehicles for expanding the dialogue beyond the financial bottom line – e.g. Brignall (2002)[25] or consultants as an attempt at differentiation to promote sales of books and / or consultancy (e.g. Neely et al. (2002),[29] Bourne (2002),[30] Niven (2002)[31]).

Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the American Enterprise
The phrase 'balanced scorecard' primarily refers to a performance management report used by a management team, and typically this team is focused on managing the implementation of a strategy or operational activities – in a 2020 survey[1] 88% of respondents reported using Balanced Scorecard for strategy implementation management, 63% for operational management.Balanced Scorecard is also used by individuals to track personal performance, but this isuncommon – only 17% of respondents in the survey using Balanced Scorecard in this way, however it is clear from the same survey that a larger proportion (about 30%) use corporate Balanced Scorecard elements to inform personal goal setting and incentive calculations.
The first versions of Kaplan and Norton's interpretation of the balanced scorecard asserted that relevance should derive from the corporate strategy, and proposed design methods that focused on choosing measures and targets associated with the main activities required to implement the strategy.As the initial audience for this were the readers of the Harvard Business Review, the proposal was translated into a form that made sense to a typical reader of that journal – managers of US commercial businesses.Accordingly, initial designs were encouraged to measure three categories of non-financial measure in addition to financial outputs – those of "customer," "internal business processes" and "learning and growth."These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations,[21] or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997),[22] Ahn (2001),[23] Elefalke (2001),[24] Brignall (2002),[25] Irwin (2002),[26] Radnor et al. (2003)[27]).

Many of the structural variations proposed are broadly similar, and a research paper published in 2004[7] attempted to identify a pattern in these alternatives – noting three distinct types of variation. The variations appeared to be part of an evolution of the balanced scorecard concept, and so the paper refers to these distinct types as "generations".Broadly, the original 'measures in four boxes' type design (as initially proposed by Kaplan & Norton[5]) constitutes the 1st generation balanced scorecard design; balanced scorecard designs that include a 'strategy map' or 'strategic linkage model' (e.g. the Performance Prism,[29] later Kaplan & Norton designs[17] the Performance Driver model of Olve, Roy & Wetter (English translation 1999,[16] 1st published in Swedish 1997)) constitute the 2nd Generation of Balanced Scorecard design; and designs that augment the strategy map / strategic linkage model with a separate document describing the long-term outcomes sought from the strategy (the "destination statement" idea) comprise the 3rd generation balanced scorecard design.
The processes of collecting, reporting, and distributing balanced scorecard information can be labor-intensive and prone to procedural problems (for example, getting all relevant people to return the information required by the required date).The simplest mechanism to use is to delegate these activities to an individual, and many Balanced Scorecards are reported via ad hoc methods based around email, phone calls and office software.[1]
"Balanced Scorecard and Results-Based Management – Convergent Performance Management Systems"
The characteristic feature of the balanced scorecard and its derivatives is the presentation of a mixture of financial and non-financial measures each compared to a 'target' value within a single concise report.The report is not meant to be a replacement for traditional financial or operational reports but a succinct summary that captures the information most relevant to those reading it.It is the method by which this 'most relevant' information is determined (i.e., the design processes used to select the content) that most differentiates the various versions of the tool in circulation. The balanced scorecard indirectly also provides a useful insight into an organisation's strategy – by requiring general strategic statements (e.g. mission, vision) to be precipitated into more specific/tangible forms.[20]
Two of the ideas that underpin modern balanced scorecard designs concern making it easier to select which data to observe, and ensuring that the choice of data is consistent with the ability of the observer to intervene.[7]

The first generation of balanced scorecard designs used a "four perspective" approach to identify what measures to use to track the implementation of strategy. The original four "perspectives" proposed[5] were:
a mix of financial and non-financial data items (originally divided into four "perspectives" - Financial, Customer, Internal Process, and Learning & Growth); and,
In response to these concerns there have been many studies seeking to provide (retrospective) academic underpinnings for the Balanced Scorecard concept,[7][8][47] and to provide case study and validation information for the various design generations.[24][27][54]

Although it helps focus managers' attention on strategic issues and the management of the implementation of strategy, it is important to remember that the balanced scorecard itself has no role in the formation of strategy.[7] In fact, balanced scorecards can co-exist with strategic planning systems and other tools.[8]
Although less common, these early-style balanced scorecards are still designed and used today.[1]

In more complex organizations, where there are multiple balanced scorecards to report and/or a need for co-ordination of results between balanced scorecards (for example, if one level of reports relies on information collected and reported at a lower level) the use of individual reporters is problematic.Where these conditions apply, organizations use balanced scorecard reporting software to automate the production and distribution of these reports.[1]

Design methods for balanced scorecards continue to evolve and adapt to reflect the deficiencies in the currently used methods, and the particular needs of communities of interest (e.g. NGO's and government departments have found the third generation methods embedded in results-based management more useful than first or second generation design methods).[35]
In small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) Balanced Scorecard has been found to be effective, but that focus is required on balancing design complexity and relevance with the availability of resource to do the design work.[56]Others have argued that the Balanced Scorecard is unsuitable for SMEs for a variety of reasons, including the belief that SMEs lack a long-term strategic focus (Hvolby and Thorstenson (2000), McAdam (2000)) and that SMEs have limited knowledge about performance measurement in general (Rantanen and Holtari 2000) and therefore do not recognise the benefits that might accrue from use of the tool (McAdam 2000; Bourne 2001), but it is also important to note that none of these studies attempts to theorise the reasons behind their negative findings.

Not reflective of all stakeholder needs: The third kind of criticism is that the model fails to fully reflect the needs of stakeholders – putting bias on financial stakeholders over others.Early forms of Balanced Scorecard proposed by Kaplan & Norton[5][11] were orientated towards the needs of commercial organisations in the USA – where a focus on investment return was appropriate.This focus was maintained through subsequent revisions.[51] Even now over 20 years after they were first proposed, the four most common perspectives in Balanced Scorecard designs mirror the four proposed in the original Kaplan & Norton paper.[1]There have been many studies that suggest other perspectives might better reflect the priorities of organisations – particularly but not exclusively relating to the needs of organisations in the public and Non Governmental sectors.[52] For instance, the balanced scorecard does not address important aspects of nonprofit strategy such as social dimensions, human resource elements, political issues and the distinctive nature of competition and collaboration in nonprofit settings.[53][21] More modern design approaches such as 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard, the Public Sector Scorecard[21] and the UN's Results Based Management methods explicitly consider the interests of wider stakeholder groups and perhaps address this issue in its entirety.[35]
Customer: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What is important to our customers and stakeholders?" Examples: percent of sales from new products, on time delivery, share of important customers’ purchases, ranking by important customers.

Balanced Scorecard was initially proposed as a general purpose performance management system.[4]Subsequently, it was promoted specifically as an approach to strategic performance management.[5]Balanced scorecard has more recently become a key component of structured approaches to corporate strategic management.[6]

The convex hull of a balanced set is convex and balanced (that is, it is absolutely convex). However, the balanced hull of a convex set may fail to be convex (a counter-example is given above).
If p{\displaystyle p} is a balanced function then p(ax)=p(|a|x){\displaystyle p(ax)=p(|a|x)} for every scalar a{\displaystyle a} and vector x∈X;{\displaystyle x\in X;} so in particular, p(ux)=p(x){\displaystyle p(ux)=p(x)} for every unit length scalar u{\displaystyle u} (satisfying |u|=1{\displaystyle |u|=1}) and every x∈X.{\displaystyle x\in X.}[8]Using u:=−1{\displaystyle u:=-1} shows that every balanced function is a symmetric function.
The empty set is a balanced set. As is any vector subspace of any (real or complex) vector space. In particular, {0}{\displaystyle \{0\}} is always a balanced set.

Every neighborhood (respectively, convex neighborhood) of the origin in a topological vector space X{\displaystyle X} contains a balanced (respectively, convex and balanced) open neighborhood of the origin. In fact, the following construction produces such balanced sets. Given W⊆X,{\displaystyle W\subseteq X,} the symmetric set ⋂|u|=1uW⊆W{\displaystyle \bigcap _{|u|=1}uW\subseteq W} will be convex (respectively, closed, balanced, bounded, a neighborhood of the origin, an absorbing subset of X{\displaystyle X}) whenever this is true of W.{\displaystyle W.} It will be a balanced set if W{\displaystyle W} is a star shaped at the origin,[note 1] which is true, for instance, when W{\displaystyle W} is convex and contains 0.{\displaystyle 0.} In particular, if W{\displaystyle W} is a convex neighborhood of the origin then ⋂|u|=1uW{\displaystyle \bigcap _{|u|=1}uW} will be a balanced convex neighborhood of the origin and so its topological interior will be a balanced convex open neighborhood of the origin.[5]
Let 0∈W⊆X{\displaystyle 0\in W\subseteq X} and define A=⋂|u|=1uW{\displaystyle A=\bigcap _{|u|=1}uW} (where u{\displaystyle u} denotes elements of the field K{\displaystyle \mathbb {K} } of scalars). Taking u:=1{\displaystyle u:=1} shows that A⊆W.{\displaystyle A\subseteq W.} If W{\displaystyle W} is convex then so is A{\displaystyle A} (since an intersection of convex sets is convex) and thus so is A{\displaystyle A}'s interior.

A subset S{\displaystyle S} of X{\displaystyle X} is called a .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}balanced set or balanced if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:

Let B⊆X{\displaystyle B\subseteq X} be balanced. If its topological interior IntX⁡B{\displaystyle \operatorname {Int} _{X}B} is empty then it is balanced so assume otherwise and let |s|≤1{\displaystyle |s|\leq 1} be a scalar. If s≠0{\displaystyle s\neq 0} then the map X→X{\displaystyle X\to X} defined by x↦sx{\displaystyle x\mapsto sx} is a homeomorphism, which implies sIntX⁡B=IntX⁡(sB)⊆sB⊆B;{\displaystyle s\operatorname {Int} _{X}B=\operatorname {Int} _{X}(sB)\subseteq sB\subseteq B;} because sIntX⁡B{\displaystyle s\operatorname {Int} _{X}B} is open, sIntX⁡B⊆IntX⁡B{\displaystyle s\operatorname {Int} _{X}B\subseteq \operatorname {Int} _{X}B} so that it only remains to show that this is true for s=0.{\displaystyle s=0.} However, 0∈IntX⁡B{\displaystyle 0\in \operatorname {Int} _{X}B} might not be true but when it is true then IntX⁡B{\displaystyle \operatorname {Int} _{X}B} will be balanced. ◼{\displaystyle \blacksquare }

Suppose that W{\displaystyle W} is a convex and absorbing subset of X.{\displaystyle X.} Then D:=⋂|u|=1uW{\displaystyle D:=\bigcap _{|u|=1}uW} will be convex balanced absorbing subset of X,{\displaystyle X,} which guarantees that the Minkowski functional pD:X→R{\displaystyle p_{D}:X\to \mathbb {R} } of D{\displaystyle D} will be a seminorm on X,{\displaystyle X,} thereby making (X,pD){\displaystyle \left(X,p_{D}\right)} into a seminormed space that carries its canonical pseduometrizable topology. The set of scalar multiples rD{\displaystyle rD} as r{\displaystyle r} ranges over {12,13,14,…}{\displaystyle \left\{{\tfrac {1}{2}},{\tfrac {1}{3}},{\tfrac {1}{4}},\ldots \right\}} (or over any other set of non-zero scalars having 0{\displaystyle 0} as a limit point) forms a neighborhood basis of absorbing disks at the origin for this locally convex topology. If X{\displaystyle X} is a topological vector space and if this convex absorbing subset W{\displaystyle W} is also a bounded subset of X,{\displaystyle X,} then the same will be true of the absorbing disk D:=⋂|u|=1uW,{\displaystyle D:=\bigcap _{|u|=1}uW,} in which case pD{\displaystyle p_{D}} will be a norm and (X,pD){\displaystyle \left(X,p_{D}\right)} will form what is known as an auxiliary normed space. If this normed space is a Banach space then D{\displaystyle D} is called a Banach disk.
If R:=S∩Ks{\displaystyle R:=S\cap \mathbb {K} s} then the above equality becomes R=B≤1R,{\displaystyle R=B_{\leq 1}R,} which is exactly the previous condition for a set to be balanced. Thus, S{\displaystyle S} is balanced if and only if for every s∈S,{\displaystyle s\in S,} A∩Ks{\displaystyle A\cap \mathbb {K} s} is a balanced set (according to any of the previous defining conditions).
Images and preimages of balanced sets under linear maps are again balanced. Explicitly, if L:X→Y{\displaystyle L:X\to Y} is a linear map and B⊆X{\displaystyle B\subseteq X} and C⊆Y{\displaystyle C\subseteq Y} are balanced sets, then L(B){\displaystyle L(B)} and L−1(C){\displaystyle L^{-1}(C)} are balanced sets.
Let B⊆R2{\displaystyle B\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{2}} be the union of the line segment between the points (−1,0){\displaystyle (-1,0)} and (1,0){\displaystyle (1,0)} and the line segment between (0,−1){\displaystyle (0,-1)} and (0,1).{\displaystyle (0,1).} Then B{\displaystyle B} is balanced but not convex or absorbing. However, span⁡B=R2.{\displaystyle \operatorname {span} B=\mathbb {R} ^{2}.}

The balanced hull or balanced envelope of a set S{\displaystyle S} is the smallest balanced set containing S.{\displaystyle S.}The balanced core of a subset S{\displaystyle S} is the largest balanced set contained in S.{\displaystyle S.}
Topological vector space – Vector space with a notion of nearness
Absorbing set – Set that can be "inflated" to reach any point
For any collection S{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} of subsets of X,{\displaystyle X,}
for any 1-dimensional vector subspace Y{\displaystyle Y} of X,{\displaystyle X,} the set B∩Y{\displaystyle B\cap Y} is convex and balanced. If B{\displaystyle B} is not empty and if Y{\displaystyle Y} is a 1-dimensional vector subspace of span⁡B{\displaystyle \operatorname {span} B} then B∩Y{\displaystyle B\cap Y} is either {0}{\displaystyle \{0\}} or else it is absorbing in Y.{\displaystyle Y.}
For every 0≤t≤π,{\displaystyle 0\leq t\leq \pi ,} let rt{\displaystyle r_{t}} be any positive real number and let Bt{\displaystyle B^{t}} be the (open or closed) line segment in X:=R2{\displaystyle X:=\mathbb {R} ^{2}} between the points (cos⁡t,sin⁡t){\displaystyle (\cos t,\sin t)} and −(cos⁡t,sin⁡t).{\displaystyle -(\cos t,\sin t).} Then the set B=⋃0≤t<πrtBt{\displaystyle B=\bigcup _{0\leq t<\pi }r_{t}B^{t}} is a balanced and absorbing set but it is not necessarily convex.
For every s∈S,{\displaystyle s\in S,} S∩Ks=B≤1(S∩Ks).{\displaystyle S\cap \mathbb {K} s=B_{\leq 1}(S\cap \mathbb {K} s).}Ks=span⁡{s}{\displaystyle \mathbb {K} s=\operatorname {span} \{s\}} is a 0{\displaystyle 0} (if s=0{\displaystyle s=0}) or 1{\displaystyle 1} (if s≠0{\displaystyle s\neq 0}) dimensional vector subspace of X.{\displaystyle X.}If R:=S∩Ks{\displaystyle R:=S\cap \mathbb {K} s} then the above equality becomes R=B≤1R,{\displaystyle R=B_{\leq 1}R,} which is exactly the previous condition for a set to be balanced. Thus, S{\displaystyle S} is balanced if and only if for every s∈S,{\displaystyle s\in S,} A∩Ks{\displaystyle A\cap \mathbb {K} s} is a balanced set (according to any of the previous defining conditions).
If a set is closed (respectively, convex, absorbing, a neighborhood of the origin) then the same is true of its balanced core.

The next example shows that the balanced hull of a convex set may fail to be convex (however, the convex hull of a balanced set is always balanced). For an example, let the convex subset be S:=[−1,1]×{1},{\displaystyle S:=[-1,1]\times \{1\},} which is a horizontal closed line segment lying above the x−{\displaystyle x-}axis in X:=R2.{\displaystyle X:=\mathbb {R} ^{2}.} The balanced hull bal⁡S{\displaystyle \operatorname {bal} S} is a non-convex subset that is "hour glass shaped" and equal to the union of two closed and filled isosceles triangles T1{\displaystyle T_{1}} and T2,{\displaystyle T_{2},} where T2=−T1{\displaystyle T_{2}=-T_{1}} and T1{\displaystyle T_{1}} is the filled triangle whose vertices are the origin together with the endpoints of S{\displaystyle S} (said differently, T1{\displaystyle T_{1}} is the convex hull of S∪{(0,0)}{\displaystyle S\cup \{(0,0)\}} while T2{\displaystyle T_{2}} is the convex hull of (−S)∪{(0,0)}{\displaystyle (-S)\cup \{(0,0)\}}).

Balanced sets are ubiquitous in functional analysis because every neighborhood of the origin in every topological vector space (TVS) contains a balanced neighborhood of the origin and every convex neighborhood of the origin contains a balanced convex neighborhood of the origin (even if the TVS is not locally convex). This neighborhood can also be chosen to be an open set or, alternatively, a closed set.

A set T{\displaystyle T} is balanced if and only if it is equal to its balanced hull bal⁡T{\displaystyle \operatorname {bal} T} or to its balanced core balcore⁡T,{\displaystyle \operatorname {balcore} T,} in which case all three of these sets are equal: T=bal⁡T=balcore⁡T.{\displaystyle T=\operatorname {bal} T=\operatorname {balcore} T.}
In any topological vector space, the closure of a balanced set is balanced.[5] The union of {0}{\displaystyle \{0\}} and the topological interior of a balanced set is balanced. Therefore, the topological interior of a balanced neighborhood of the origin is balanced.[5][proof 1] However, {(z,w)∈C2:|z|≤|w|}{\displaystyle \left\{(z,w)\in \mathbb {C} ^{2}:|z|\leq |w|\right\}} is a balanced subset of X=C2{\displaystyle X=\mathbb {C} ^{2}} that contains the origin (0,0)∈X{\displaystyle (0,0)\in X} but whose (nonempty) topological interior does not contain the origin and is therefore not a balanced set.[6]
Convex set – In geometry, set whose intersection with every line is a single line segment
The balanced sets are C{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } itself, the empty set and the open and closed discs centered at zero. Contrariwise, in the two dimensional Euclidean space there are many more balanced sets: any line segment with midpoint at the origin will do. As a result, C{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } and R2{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} are entirely different as far as scalar multiplication is concerned.
A real-valued function p:X→R{\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } is a seminorm if and only if it is a balanced sublinear function.

In linear algebra and related areas of mathematics a balanced set, circled set or disk in a vector space (over a field K{\displaystyle \mathbb {K} } with an absolute value function |⋅|{\displaystyle |\cdot |}) is a set S{\displaystyle S} such that aS⊆S{\displaystyle aS\subseteq S} for all scalars a{\displaystyle a} satisfying |a|≤1.{\displaystyle |a|\leq 1.}
A balanced set is not empty if and only if it contains the origin. By definition, a set is absolutely convex if and only if it is convex and balanced. Every balanced set is star-shaped (at 0) and a symmetric set.If B{\displaystyle B} is a balanced subset of X{\displaystyle X} then

Once value has been analysed and the contributing parts of the organisation have been identified, other models can be used in conjunction with the value chain to assess how these areas can either be improved or capitalised upon. For example, a SWOT analysis can be used within the "outbound logistics" function to understand what its strengths and weaknesses are, and what opportunities there may be to improve that area, or identify the threats to what may be a critical part of the value delivery system.
Value chain analysis has also been successfully used in large petrochemical plant maintenance organizations to show how work selection, work planning, work scheduling and finally work execution can (when considered as elements of chains) help drive lean approaches to maintenance. The Maintenance Value Chain approach is particularly successful when used as a tool for helping change management as it is seen as more user-friendly than other business process tools.

The value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning. The simpler concept of value stream mapping, a cross-functional process which was developed over the next decade,[14] had some success in the early 1990s.[15]

The virtual value chain, created by John Sviokla and Jeffrey Rayport,[7] is a business model describing the dissemination of value-generating information services throughout an Extended Enterprise . This value chain begins with the content supplied by the provider, which is then distributed and supported by the information infrastructure; thereupon the context provider supplies actual customer interaction. It supports the physical value chain of procurement, manufacturing, distribution and sales of traditional companies.
Equally, other models can be used to assess performance, risk, market potential, environmental waste, etc.

The appropriate level for constructing a value chain is the business unit,[5] not division or corporate level. Products pass through a chain of activities in order, and at each activity the product gains some value. The chain of activities gives the products more added value than the sum of added values of all activities.[5]
An industry value-chain is a physical representation of the various processes involved in producing goods (and services), starting with raw materials and ending with the delivered product (also known as the supply chain). It is based on the notion of value-added at the link (read: stage of production) level. The sum total of link-level value-added yields total value. The French Physiocrats' Tableau économique is one of the earliest examples of a value chain. Wasilly Leontief's Input-Output tables, published in the 1950s, provide estimates of the relative importance of each individual link in industry-level value-chains for the U.S. economy.
Through global value chains, there has been growth in interconnectedness as MNEs play an increasingly larger role in the internationalisation of business. In response, governments have cut Corporate income tax (CIT) rates or introduced new incentives for research and development to compete in this changing geopolitical landscape.(LeBlanc, Matthews & Mellbye 2013, p. 6) harv error: no target: CITEREFLeBlancMatthewsMellbye2013 (help)[8]
Often multinational enterprises (MNEs) developed global value chains, investing abroad and establishing affiliates that provided critical support to remaining activities at home.To enhance efficiency and to optimize profits, multinational enterprises locate "research, development, design, assembly, production of parts, marketing and branding" activities in different countries around the globe. MNEs offshore labour-intensive activities to China and Mexico, for example, where the cost of labor is the lowest.(Gurría 2012) harv error: no target: CITEREFGurría2012 (help)[4] the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises.(Gurría 2012) harv error: no target: CITEREFGurría2012 (help)[4]

Capturing the value generated along the chain is the new approach taken by many management strategists. For example, a manufacturer might require its parts suppliers to be located nearby its assembly plant to minimize the cost of transportation. By exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain, the firms may try to bypass the intermediaries creating new business models, or in other ways create improvements in its value system.

Infrastructure: consists of activities such as accounting, legal, finance, control, public relations, quality assurance and general (strategic) management.
Using support activities helps make primary activities more effective. Increasing any of the four support activities helps at least one primary activity to work more efficiently.
Human resources management: consists of all activities involved in recruiting, hiring, training, developing, compensating and (if necessary) dismissing or laying off personnel.
The value-chain concept has been extended beyond individual firms. It can apply to whole supply chains and distribution networks. The delivery of a mix of products (goods and services) to the end customer will mobilize different economic factors, each managing its own value chain. The industry wide synchronized interactions of those local value chains create an extended value chain, sometimes global in extent. Porter terms this larger interconnected system of value chains the "value system". A value system includes the value chains of a firm's supplier (and their suppliers all the way back), the firm itself, the firm distribution channels, and the firm's buyers (and presumably extended to the buyers of their products, and so on).

The idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organizations, the idea of seeing a manufacturing (or service) organization as a system, made up of subsystems each with inputs, transformation processes and outputs. Inputs, transformation processes, and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money, labour, materials, equipment, buildings, land, administration and management. How value chain activities are carried out determines costs and affects profits.

For example, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has investigated strengthening the value chain for sweet sorghum as a biofuel crop in India. Its aim in doing so was to provide a sustainable means of making ethanol that would increase the incomes of the rural poor, without sacrificing food and fodder security, while protecting the environment.[13]

Companies can harness a competitive advantage at any one of the five activities in the value chain. For example, by creating outbound logistics that are highly efficient or by reducing a company's shipping costs, it allows to either realize more profits or pass the savings to the consumer by way of lower prices.[6]
Human Resource value chain is to help improve business performance by applying the full capabilities of people.

A value chain is a progression of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable product (i.e., good and/or service) to the end customer. The concept comes through business management and was first describedby Michael Porter in his 1985 best-seller, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance.[1]
The activity of a diamond cutter can illustrate the difference between cost and the value chain. The cutting activity may have a low cost, but the activity adds much of the value to the end product, since a rough diamond is significantly less valuable than a cut diamond. Typically, the described value chain and the documentation of processes, assessment and auditing of adherence to the process routines are at the core of the quality certification of the business, e.g. ISO 9001.[citation needed]

A firm's value chain forms a part of a larger stream of activities, which Porter calls a value system.[citation needed] A value system, or an industry value chain, includes the suppliers that provide the inputs necessary to the firm along with their value chains. After the firm creates products, these products pass through the value chains of distributors (which also have their own value chains), all the way to the customers. All parts of these chains are included in the value system. To achieve and sustain a competitive advantage, and to support that advantage with information technologies, a firm must understand every component of this value system.[citation needed]
Technological development: pertains to the equipment, hardware, software, procedures and technical knowledge brought to bear in the firm's transformation of inputs(Raw materials) into outputs(Finished goods).
A value chain approach could also offer a meaningful alternative to evaluate private or public companies when there is a lack of publicly known data from direct competition, where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies.

Dashboards involve the combination of visual and functional features. This combination of features helps improve cognition and interpretation. A performance dashboard sits at the intersection of two powerful disciplines: business intelligence and performance management. Therefore, there are different users who could use these dashboards for different reasons. For example, a level of workers could look at monitoring inventory while those in more managerial roles can look at lagging measure. Then executives could utilize the dashboard to evaluate strategic performance against objectives.[8]
There are many connections between dashboards and accounting. Dashboards aid with budgeting, management control, and wage control. Dashboards are used to present data in a quick and easy to read way. The ability to present data in a quick way with a visual allows for more data to be processed and understood. Dashboards are used for performance reports, sales analysis on sectors, and inventory rotation. Dashboards should be quick visualizations that allow decisions to be made quicker than they usually would without the access to dashboard technology.
Measures – also called metric or key performance indicators (KPIs)
There are a few key elements to a good dashboard:.[16]
Digital dashboard technology is available "out-of-the-box" from many software providers. Some companies, however, continue to do in-house development and maintenance of dashboard applications. For example, GE Aviation has developed a proprietary software/portal called "Digital Cockpit" to monitor the trends in the aircraft spare parts business.

Power BI provides the tools for a user to create different types of visualizations to communicate the data that they are using. Some examples of these visualizations include graphs, maps, and clustered columns. Power BI pulls data from Excel that can be used to create dashboards and visualizations. Whereas Excel does not import data from Power BI. Excel is typically used for less data and Power BI is more complex. Power BI can be used to display trends over time. For example, a company can create a time plot that shows its costs and revenues over a certain period. The data can then be arranged to show per day, month, quarter, year, etc. This requires simple formatting tools so the data can quickly be changed and compared. Power BI allows the user to customize their visualizations by adding colors and labels. In addition, when the user clicks a data point, they are able to understand what the point or selection is showing. Power BI also has a commonly used map feature where businesses can view their sales and earnings across different states and countries. Places with the highest amounts of data will appear larger in size. For example, a state with the most revenue will be bigger than states with less data. Power BI is also interactive in that in any type of map a person can expand a specific category to look deeper into the data contained.[20]

Digital dashboard projects involve business units as the driver and the information technology department as the enabler. Therefore, the success of dashboard projects depends on the relevancy/importance of information provided within the dashboard. This includes the metrics chosen to monitor and the timeliness of the data forming those metrics; data must be up to date and accurate.

In business computer information systems, a dashboard is a type of graphical user interface which often provides at-a-glance views of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. In other usage, "dashboard" is another name for "progress report" or "report" and considered a form of data visualization. In providing this overview, business owners can save time and improve their decision making by utilizing dashboards.[1]
Spotlight indicators – red, yellow, or green symbols that provide an at-a-glance view of a measure's performance.
The idea of digital dashboards followed the study of decision support systems in the 1970s. Early predecessors of the modern business dashboard were first developed in the 1980s in the form of Executive Information Systems (EISs). Due to problems primarily with data refreshing and handling, it was soon realized that the approach wasn't practical as information was often incomplete, unreliable, and spread across too many disparate sources.[5] Thus, EISs hibernated until the 1990s when the information age quickened pace and data warehousing, and online analytical processing (OLAP) allowed dashboards to function adequately.[citation needed] Despite the availability of enabling technologies, the dashboard use didn't become popular until later in that decade, with the rise of key performance indicators (KPIs), and the introduction of Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton's balanced scorecard.[6] In the late 1990s, Microsoft promoted a concept known as the Digital Nervous System and "digital dashboards" were described as being one leg of that concept.[7] Today, the use of dashboards forms an important part of Business Performance Management (BPM). Initially dashboards were used for monitoring purposes, now with the advancement of technology, dashboards are being used for more analytical purposes. The use of dashboards has now been incorporating; scenario analysis, drill down capabilities, and presentation format flexibility.[8]
Good dashboard design practices take into account and address the following:

Dashboards offers a holistic view of the entire business as it gives the manager a bird's eye view into the performance of sales, data inventory, web traffic, social media analytics and other associated data that is visually presented on a single dashboard. Dashboards lead to better management of marketing/financial strategies as a dashboard for the display of marketing data makes the process of marketing easier and more reliable as compared to doing it manually. Web analytics play a crucial role in shaping the marketing strategy of many businesses. Dashboards also facilitate for better tracking of sales and financial reporting as the data is more precise and in one area. Lastly, dashboards offer for better customer service through monitoring because they keep both the managers and the clients updated on the project progress through automated emails and notifications.[citation needed]
"The Use of Dashboards in Performance Management: Evidence from Sales Managers"
In order for a dashboard to be efficient, the individual creating the dashboard needs to make sure that the information is simple and easy to read and be interpreted.[22]
Tableau is another program that allows users to create dashboards. One of Tableau's biggest advantages is how much data it can hold. Tableau can hold an unlimited amount, whereas Excel has a capacity of 1,048,576 rows. Tableau has the ability to make interactive dashboards by clicking into a specific point. For example, you can have data be displayed within a map. By clicking a specific state or city you can get a closer look at the data contained within that location. Filters and parameters can also be added. For example, if one were to analyze revenues across the United States you could set a parameter to only show salaries within a particular range. Once set, only states within this range will be highlighted.[21]
Strategic dashboards support managers at any level in an organization and provide the quick overview that decision-makers need to monitor the health and opportunities of the business. Dashboards of this type focus on high-level measures of performance and forecasts. Strategic dashboards benefit from static snapshots of data (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) that are not constantly changing from one moment to the next.

Digital dashboards may be laid out to track the flows inherent in the business processes that they monitor. Graphically, users may see the high-level processes and then drill down into low-level data. This level of detail is often buried deep within the corporate enterprise and otherwise unavailable to the senior executives.

Balanced scorecards and dashboards have been linked together as if they were interchangeable. However, although both visually display critical information, the difference is in the format: Scorecards can open the quality of an operation while dashboards provide calculated direction. A balanced scorecard has what they called a "prescriptive" format. It should always contain these components:
The “dashboard” is often accessible by a web browser and is usually linked to regularly updating data sources.

"Reporting 2.0 – Interactive Visualizations and Dashboards for Big Data"
Excel has many tools that help the user not only implement data but also visualize data. Excel has many built in functions that can help break down data and also separate data by scenarios. The user can easily download and add files to their Excel sheets to use for their data. Other tools Excel offers is the use of conditional formatting and basic pivot tables and charts. Excel allows the user to reference other cells which ultimately allows for complex computations to be made and conclusions to be drawn from data.[3]

Victoria Hetherington, Dashboard Demystified: What is a Dashboard? (Hetherington, 2009)
Specialized dashboards may track all corporate functions. Examples include human resources, recruiting, sales, operations, security, information technology, project management, customer relationship management, digital marketing and many more departmental dashboards. For a smaller organization like a startup a compact startup scorecard dashboard tracks important activities across lot of domains ranging from social media to sales.
The design of a dashboard is more loosely defined. Dashboards are usually a series of graphics, charts, gauges and other visual indicators that can be monitored and interpreted. Even when there is a strategic link, on a dashboard, it may not be noticed as such since objectives are not normally present on dashboards. However, dashboards can be customized to link their graphs and charts to strategic objectives.[12]

There are certain guidelines that can be useful when creating dashboards and other visualizations. The guidelines have a structure that can be followed and that is beginning with reading direction. When it comes to how you are arranging your information on your dashboard or a visualization it can be helpful to think about reading direction. General reading direction is from left to right and from top to bottom. Having information flow in this structure will allow others to read and understand your visuals in a more natural structure. Local proximity is another idea to keep in mind when creating a visual or a dashboard. Having information in a close proximity can be compared with a better effectiveness and allow users to draw conclusions. Being able to make sure the user is not being overloaded with information when creating your visual. Having a few key figures with significant importance can be more helpful compared to having too much information. When you have too much information and not a structure to what you are presenting then that is known as a “data graveyard”. Another aspect to keep in mind while creating visuals that goes along with information overload is the idea of interaction within your visual. Interacting with the dashboard would allow for further detail to be obtained from the user and allow them to better understand the information on your dashboard.
the medium it is designed for (desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet)
Dashboards serve as a visual representation for a company to monitor progress and trends, not only among themselves but against other companies as well. Dashboards and visualizations contain data that is updated in real time. For example, if the underlying data in an Excel spreadsheet were to change, so would the visualization.
Digital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. In addition, they enable “rolling up” of information to present a consolidated view across an organization. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a "snapshot" of performance.
Ability to make more informed decisions based on collected business intelligence
Chart visualization is an important aspect when creating dashboards, diagrams in particular. When you have complex data it can be difficult to come to conclusions from that material and being able to have different visual elements within the dashboard can be helpful in giving a larger overview of the material. Being able to have a visual reporting system allows multiple processing operations to be carried out and that could increase the effectiveness of decisions. There are different types of visualizations that can be seen as more effective depending on the data type and the recipient. Looking at traditional business graphics in an interactive form is another aspect to keep in mind when creating a dashboard. Business charts are used mainly in the form of interactive dashboards. A major advantage of business charts is that the majority of users have an understanding of them.

Both Desktop and Browser-based providers enable the distribution of dashboards via a web browser. An example of the latter is web-based-browser Asana, which helps teams orchestrate their work, from daily tasks to strategic cross-functional initiatives. With it, teams can manage everything from company objectives to digital transformation to product launches and marketing campaigns.

Dashboards for analytical purposes often include more context, comparisons, and history, along with subtler performance evaluators. In addition, analytical dashboards typically support interactions with the data, such as drilling down into the underlying details. Dashboards for monitoring operations are often designed differently from those that support strategic decision making or data analysis and often require monitoring of activities and events that are constantly changing and might require attention and response at a moment's notice.

WO strategy (mini–maxi): Faced with external opportunities and internal weaknesses, how to minimize weaknesses and maximize opportunities?
Although the SWOT analysis was originally designed as an organizational method for business and industries, it has been replicated in community work as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat the internal and external opposition.[18] Understanding the particular community can be helped via public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews and other data collection.[18] The SWOT analysis provides direction to the next stages of the change process.[20] It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of social work practice.[20]

What Andrews and his colleagues in the Business Policy course resolutely refused to do—and the main reason his ideas largely disappear from the subsequent history of strategy—was to agree that there were standard frameworks or constructs that could be applied to analyzing a business and its competitive situation. Oh, they might allow one, perhaps because they had helped develop it: so-called SWOT analysis, which called for looking at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats besetting an enterprise.

Developing new/revised strategies—revised analysis of strategic issues may mean the objectives need to change
Internal factors are viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon their effect on the organization's objectives. What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses (distractions, competition) for another objective. The factors may include personnel, finance, manufacturing capabilities, and all of the marketing mix's 4Ps.

Results of the assessment are often presented in the form of a matrix,[6] or simply as paragraphs.
In a highly cited 1997 critique, "SWOT Analysis: It's Time for a Product Recall", Terry Hill and Roy Westbrook observed that one among many problems of SWOT analysis as it is often practiced is that "no-one subsequently used the outputs [of SWOT analysis] within the later stages of the strategy".[22] Hill and Westbrook, among others, also criticized hastily designed SWOT lists.[22][23] Other examples of potential pitfalls in practice are: preoccupation with a single strength, such as cost control, leading to a neglect of weaknesses, such as product quality;[21] and domination by one or two team members doing the SWOT analysis and devaluing possibly important contributions of other team members.[24] Many other limitations have been identified.[13]

This technique is designed for use in the preliminary stages of decision-making processes and can be used as a tool for evaluation of the strategic position of organizations of many kinds (for-profit enterprises, local and national governments, NGOs, etc.).[4] It is intended to identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving the objectives of the venture or project. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as a tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis,[5] but has also been criticized for its limitations, and alternatives have been developed.
For instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an aggressive strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a potential warning and advice for using a defensive strategy.[14]
An analysis of the "design school" model was also in Mintzberg's earlier publications such as: Mintzberg, Henry (March 1990). "The design school: reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management". Strategic Management Journal. 11 (3): 171–195. doi:10.1002/smj.4250110302. JSTOR 2486485.
Also in 1965, four colleagues at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration—Edmund P. Learned, C. Roland Christensen, Kenneth R. Andrews, and William D. Guth—published the first of many editions of the textbook Business Policy: Text and Cases.[8] (Business policy was a term then current for what has come to be called strategic management.[32]) The first chapter of the textbook stated, without using the acronym, the four components of SWOT and their division into internal and external appraisal:

In project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative.[30] It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements hypothesized to be at play in a given project:[30]: 9

Examples of the "tried-and-true" trope:Sevier, Robert A. (2001). "Not SWOT, but OTSW".

ISBN 0971059705. OCLC 48165005. Few people realize that there is an inherent danger in conducting a situational analysis using the old tried and true SWOT. The danger is this: When you look inside the organization first, you create a set of glasses through which you will look at the world. In doing so, you are highly likely to overlook significant opportunities and threats. See also Minsky & Aron 2021.Staples, Lee (2004). Roots to power: a manual for grassroots organizing (2nd ed.). Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishing. p. 136. ISBN 0275969975. OCLC 56085984. The tried and true SWOT Assessment examines positive and negative factors as does a Force Field Analysis, but a SWOT has a particular focus on the upsides and downsides for the action group itself.Lambert, Ron; Parker, Tom (2006).

Before you as a salesperson can develop a strategy, you have to assess the situation. We recommend the tried-and-true SWOT analysis. You start by taking a look at your Strengths and Weaknesses, your Opportunities and any Threats. Then you do exactly the same thing from the perspective of each of your competitors.

One way of using SWOT is matching and converting.[15] Matching is used to find competitive advantage by matching the strengths to opportunities. Another tactic is to convert weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to find new markets. If the threats or weaknesses cannot be converted, a company should try to minimize or avoid them.
A number of authors advocate assessing external factors before internal factors.[2][7][11]

In competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing especially on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of vertical integration, historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Deciding what strategy should be is, at least ideally, a rational undertaking. Its principal subactivities include identifying opportunities and threats in the company's environment and attaching some estimate of risk to the discernible alternatives. Before a choice can be made, the company's strengths and weaknesses must be appraised.[8]
SWOT analysis is described in very many publications. A few examples of books that describe SWOT analysis and are widely held by WorldCat member libraries and available in the Internet Archive are:

Strengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others
The lords of strategy: the secret intellectual history of the new corporate world
By the end of the 1960s, the four components of SWOT (without using the acronym) had appeared in other publications on strategic planning by various authors,[37] and by 1972 the acronym had appeared in the title of a journal article by Norman Stait, a management consultant at the British firm Urwick, Orr and Partners.[38] By 1973, the acronym was well-known enough that accountant William W. Fea, in a published lecture, mentioned "the mnemonic, familiar to students, of S.W.O.T., namely strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats".[39] An early example of a 2 × 2 SWOT matrix is found in a 1980 article by management professor Igor Ansoff (but Ansoff used the acronym T/O/S/W instead of SWOT).[6]

Looking back from three decades later, in the book Strategy Safari (1998), management scholar Henry Mintzberg and colleagues said that Business Policy: Text and Cases "quickly became the most popular classroom book in the field", widely diffusing its authors' ideas, which Mintzberg et al. called the "design school" model (in contrast to nine other schools that they identified) of strategic management, "with its famous notion of SWOT" emphasizing assessment of a company's internal and external situations.[10][33][32] However, the textbook contains neither a 2 × 2 SWOT matrix nor any detailed procedure for doing a SWOT assessment.[8] Strategy Safari and other books identified Kenneth R. Andrews as the co-author of Business Policy: Text and Cases who was responsible for writing the theoretical part of the book containing the SWOT components.[10][34][35] More generally, Mintzberg et al. attributed some conceptual influences on what they called the "design school" (of which they were strongly critical) to earlier books by Philip Selznick (Leadership in Administration, 1957) and Alfred D. Chandler Jr. (Strategy and Structure, 1962),[10] with other possible influences going back to the McKinsey consulting firm in the 1930s.[33][36]

Opportunities: elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage
SWOT analysis can be used to build organizational or personal strategy. Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identification of internal and external factors (often using the popular 2 × 2 matrix), selection and evaluation of the most important factors, and identification of relations existing between internal and external features.[13]

Analysis of existing strategies—this should determine relevance from the results of an internal/external appraisal, and may include gap analysis of environmental factors
SWOT analysis (or SWOT matrix) is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. It is sometimes called situational assessment or situational analysis.[1] Additional acronyms using the same components include TOWS and WOTS-UP.[2][3]
Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.
Internal appraisals of the organization—an assessment of the present situation as well as a portfolio of products/services and an analysis of the product/service lifecycle
Legislation—Do new government requirements make the work harder or easier?

One form of TOWS matrix combines each of the four components with another to examine four distinct strategies:[2]
The SWOT analysis has been used in community work as a tool to identify positive and negative factors within organizations, communities, and the broader society that promote or inhibit successful implementation of social services and social change efforts.[18] It is used as a preliminary resource, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a community served by a nonprofit or community organization.[19]

SWOT analysis has been used at different levels of analysis in many arenas, not just in profit-seeking organizations.[citation needed] Examples include non-profit organizations, governmental units, and individuals.[citation needed] SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning and preventive crisis management. SWOT analysis may also be used in creating a recommendation during a viability study/survey.

"SWOT analysis I: looking outside for opportunities and threats; SWOT analysis II: looking inside for strengths and weaknesses"
In 1965, three colleagues at the Long Range Planning Service of Stanford Research Institute—Robert F. Stewart, Otis J. Benepe, and Arnold Mitchell—wrote a technical report titled Formal Planning: The Staff Planner's Role at Start-Up.[31] The report described how a person in the role of a company's staff planner would gather information from managers assessing operational issues grouped into four components represented by the acronym SOFT: the "satisfactory" in present operations, "opportunities" in future operations, "faults" in present operations, and "threats" to future operations.[31] Stewart et al. focused on internal operational assessment and divided the four components into present (satisfactory and fault) and future (opportunity and threat),[31] and not, as would later become common in SWOT analysis, into internal (strengths and weaknesses) and external (opportunities and threats).[8]

Michael Porter developed the five forces framework as a reaction to SWOT, which he found lacking in rigor and too ad hoc.[25]
Strengths and weaknesses are usually considered internal, while opportunities and threats are usually considered external.[7] The degree to which the internal strengths of the firm matches with the external opportunities is expressed by the concept of strategic fit.[8][9][10]

On the other hand, exactly what is a high relative share is a matter of some debate. The best evidence is that the most stable position (at least in fast-moving consumer goods markets) is for the brand leader to have a share double that of the second brand, and triple that of the third. Brand leaders in this position tend to be very stable—and profitable; the Rule of 123.
This indicates likely cash generation, because the higher the share the more cash will be generated. As a result of 'economies of scale' (a basic assumption of the BCG Matrix), it is assumed that these earnings will grow faster the higher the share. The exact measure is the brand's share relative to its largest competitor. Thus, if the brand had a share of 20 percent, and the largest competitor had the same, the ratio would be 1:1. If the largest competitor had a share of 60 percent, however, the ratio would be 1:3, implying that the organization's brand was in a relatively weak position. If the largest competitor only had a share of 5 percent, the ratio would be 4:1, implying that the brand owned was in a relatively strong position, which might be reflected in profits and cash flows. If this technique is used in practice, this scale is logarithmic, not linear.

There are further criticisms to the BCG Matrix. The Matrix defines dogs as having low market share and relatively low market growth rate.[10]

To be successful, a company should have a portfolio of products with different growth rates and different market shares. The portfolio composition is a function of the balance between cash flows. High growth products require cash inputs to grow. Low growth products should generate excess cash. Both kinds are needed simultaneously.

For each product or service, the 'area' of the circle represents the value of its sales. The growth–share matrix thus offers a "map" of the organization's product (or service) strengths and weaknesses, at least in terms of current profitability, as well as the likely cashflows. Common spreadsheet applications can be used to generate the matrix. In addition, designated online tools are available.
Rapidly growingin rapidly growing markets, are what organizations strive for; but, as we have seen, the penalty is that they are usually net cash users – they require investment. The reason for this is often because the growth is being 'bought' by the high investment, in the reasonable expectation that a high market share will eventually turn into a sound investment in future profits. The theory behind the matrix assumes, therefore, that a higher growth rate is indicative of accompanying demands on investment. The cut-off point is usually chosen as 10 per cent per annum. Determining this cut-off point, the rate above which the growth is deemed to be significant (and likely to lead to extra demands on cash) is a critical requirement of the technique; and one that, again, makes the use of the growth–share matrix problematical in some product areas. What is more, the evidence, from fast-moving consumer goods markets at least, is that the most typical pattern is of very low growth, less than 1 per cent per annum. This is outside the range normally considered in BCG Matrix work, which may make application of this form of analysis unworkable in many markets.[citation needed]Where it can be applied, however, the market growth rate says more about the brand position than just its cash flow. It is a good indicator of that market's strength, of its future potential (of its 'maturity' in terms of the market life-cycle), and also of its attractiveness to future competitors. It can also be used in growth analysis.
'Minority applicability'. The cashflow techniques are only applicable to a very limited number of markets (where growth is relatively high, and a definite pattern of product life-cycles can be observed, such as that of ethical pharmaceuticals). In the majority of markets, use may give misleading results.
The reality is that it is only the 'cash cows' that are really important—all the other elements are supporting actors. It is a foolish vendor who diverts funds from a 'cash cow' when these are needed to extend the life of that 'product'. Although it is necessary to recognize a 'dog' when it appears (at least before it bites you) it would be foolish in the extreme to create one in order to balance up the picture. The vendor, who has most of his (or her) products in the 'cash cow' quadrant, should consider himself (or herself) fortunate indeed, and an excellent marketer, although he or she might also consider creating a few stars as an insurance policy against unexpected future developments and, perhaps, to add some extra growth.There is also a common misconception that 'dogs' are a waste of resources.In many markets 'dogs' can be considered loss-leaders that while not themselves profitable will lead to increased sales in other profitable areas.

Stars are units with a high market share in a fast-growing industry.They are graduated question marks with a market- or niche-leading trajectory, for example:amongst market share front-runners in a high-growth sector, and/or having a monopolistic or increasingly dominant unique selling proposition with burgeoning/fortuitous proposition drive(s) from: novelty, fashion/promotion (e.g. newly prestigious celebrity-branded fragrances), customer loyalty (e.g. greenfield or military/gang enforcement backed, and/or innovative, grey-market/illicit retail of addictive drugs, for instance the British East India Company's, late-1700s opium-based Qianlong Emperor embargo-busting, Canton System), goodwill (e.g. monopsonies) and/or gearing (e.g. oligopolies, for instance Portland cement producers near boomtowns),[citation needed] etc.The hope is that stars become next cash cows.
Question marks (also known as a problem child or Wild dogs) are businesses operating with a low market share in a high-growth market. They are a starting point for most businesses. Question marks have a potential to gain market share and become stars, and eventually cash cows when market growth slows. If question marks do not succeed in becoming a market leader, then after perhaps years of cash consumption, they will degenerate into dogs when market growth declines. When shift from question mark to star is unlikely, the BCG matrix suggests divesting the question mark and repositioning its resources more effectively in the remainder of the corporate portfolio.[6]Question marks must be analyzed carefully in order to determine whether they are worth the investment required to grow market share.
The selection of the relative market share metric was based upon its relationship to the experience curve. The market leader would have greater experience curve benefits, which delivers a cost leadership advantage.

As a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either cash cows or dogs. The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as question marks, then turn into stars. Eventually, the market stops growing; thus, the business unit becomes a cash cow. At the end of the cycle, the cash cow turns into a dog.

Dogs,more charitably called pets,are units with low market share in a mature, slow-growing industry.These units typically "break even", generating barely enough cash to maintain the business's market share.Though owning a break-even unit provides the social benefit of providing jobs and possible synergies that assist other business units, from an accounting point of view such a unit is worthless, not generating cash for the company.They depress a profitable company's return on assets ratio, used by many investors to judge how well a company is being managed.Dogs, it is thought, should be sold off once short-time harvesting has been maximized.[6]

Perhaps the most important danger[11] is, however, that the apparent implication of its four-quadrant form is that there should be balance of products or services across all four quadrants; and that is, indeed, the main message that it is intended to convey. Thus, money must be diverted from 'cash cows' to fund the 'stars' of the future, since 'cash cows' will inevitably decline to become 'dogs'. There is an almost mesmeric inevitability about the whole process. It focuses attention, and funding, on to the 'stars'. It presumes, and almost demands, that 'cash cows' will turn into 'dogs'.

Another reason for choosing relative market share, rather than just profits, is that it carries more information than just cash flow. It shows where the brand is positioned against its main competitors, and indicates where it might be likely to go in the future. It can also show what type of marketing activities might be expected to be effective.[citation needed]
The need which prompted this idea was, indeed, that of managing cash-flow. It was reasoned that one of the main indicators of cash generation was relative market share, and one which pointed to cash usage was that of market growth rate.

Cash cows is where a company has high market share in a slow-growing industry.These units typically generate cash in excess of the amount of cash needed to maintain the business.They are regarded as staid and boring, in a "mature" market, yet corporations value owning them due to their cash-generating qualities.They are to be "milked" continuously with as little investment as possible, since such investment would be wasted in an industry with low growth. Cash "milked" is used to fund stars and question marks, that are expected to become cash cows some time in the future.[6]
stars whose high share and high growth assure the future;
'Milking cash cows'. Perhaps the worst implication of the later developments is that the (brand leader) cash cows should be milked to fund new brands. This is not what research into the fast-moving consumer goods markets has shown to be the case. The brand leader's position is the one, above all, to be defended, not least since brands in this position will probably outperform any number of newly launched brands. Such brand leaders will, of course, generate large cash flows; but they should not be 'milked' to such an extent that their position is jeopardized. In any case, the chance of the new brands achieving similar brand leadership may be slim—certainly far less than the popular perception of the Boston Matrix would imply.
As with most marketing techniques, there are a number of alternative offerings vying with the growth–share matrix although this appears to be the most widely used. The next most widely reported technique is that developed by McKinsey and General Electric, which is a three-cell by three-cell matrix—using the dimensions of 'industry attractiveness' and 'business strengths'. This approaches some of the same issues as the growth–share matrix but from a different direction and in a more complex way (which may be why it is used less, or is at least less widely taught). Both growth-share matrix and Industry Attractiveness-Business Strength matrix developed by McKinsey and General Electric, are criticized for being static as they portray businesses as they exist at one point in time. Business environment is subject to constant changes, hence, businesses evolve over time. The Life Cycle-Competitive Strength Matrix was introduced to overcome these deficiences and better identify "developing winners" or potential "losers".[6]A more practical approach is that of the Boston Consulting Group's Advantage Matrix, which the consultancy reportedly used itself though it is little known amongst the wider population.

The initial intent of the growth–share matrix was to evaluate business units, but the same evaluation can be made for product lines or any other cash-generating entities.This should only be attempted for real lines that have a sufficient history to allow some prediction; if the corporation has made only a few products and called them a product line, the sample variance will be too high for this sort of analysis to be meaningful.
While theoretically useful, and widely used, several academic studies have called into question whether using the growth–share matrix actually helps businesses succeed, and the model has since been removed from some major marketing textbooks.[8][9] One study (Slater andZwirlein, 1992) which looked at 129 firms found that those who follow portfolio planning models like the BCG matrix had lower shareholder returns.
As originally practiced by the Boston Consulting Group,[11] the matrix was used in situations where it could be applied for graphically illustrating a portfolio composition as a function of the balance between cash flows.[3]If used with this degree of sophistication its use would still be valid. However, later practitioners have tended to over-simplify its messages.[citation needed] In particular, the later application of the names (problem children, stars, cash cows and dogs) has tended to overshadow all else—and is often what most students, and practitioners, remember.
The growth–share matrix[2] (aka the product portfolio matrix,[3] Boston Box, BCG-matrix, Boston matrix, Boston Consulting Group analysis, portfolio diagram) is a chart created in a collaborative effort by BCG employees: Alan Zakon first sketched it and then, together with his colleagues, refined it.[4] BCG's founder Bruce D. Henderson popularized the concept in an essay titled "The Product Portfolio" in BCG's publication Perspectives in 1970.[5] The purpose of the matrix is to help corporations to analyze their business units, that is, their product lines. This helps the company allocate resources and is used as an analytical tool in brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis.

One approach for identifying core competencies with respect to a product portfolio has been proposed by Danilovic & Leisner (2007).[8] They use design structure matrices for mapping competencies to specific products in the product portfolio. Using their approach, clusters of competencies can be aggregated to core competencies. Bonjour & Micaelli (2010) introduced a similar method for assessing how far a company has achieved its development of core competencies.[9] More recently Hein et al. link core competencies to Christensen's concept of capabilities, which is defined as resources, processes, and priorities.[10][11] Furthermore, they present a method to evaluate different product architectures with respect to their contribution to the development of core competencies.

In Competing for the Future, the authors C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel show how executives can develop the industry foresight necessary to adapt to industry changes and discover ways of controlling resources that will enable the company to attain goals despite any constraints. Executives should develop a point of view on which core competencies can be built for the future to revitalize the process of new business creation. Developing an independent point of view of tomorrow's opportunities and building capabilities that exploit them is the key to future industry leadership.[vague]

Analyzing core competence and core products for developing agile and adaptable corporation.
For an organization to be competitive, it needs not only tangible resources but intangible resources like core competences that are difficult and challenging to achieve.[5] It is critical to manage and enhance the competences in response to industry changes in the future. For example, Microsoft has expertise in many IT based innovations where, for a variety of reasons, it is difficult for competitors to replicate or compete with Microsoft's core competences.

Alexander and Martin (2013) state that the competitiveness of a company is based on the ability to develop core competences.[4] A core competence is, for example, a specialised knowledge, technique, or skill. The core capability is the management ability to develop, out of the core competences, core products and new business. Competence building is, therefore, an outcome of strategic architecture which must be enforced by top management in order to exploit its full capacity.[citation needed]

Core competencies are related to a firm's product portfolio via core products. Prahalad and Hamel (1990) defined core competencies as the engines for the development of core products and services. Competencies are the roots of which the corporation grows, like a tree whose fruit are end products.[6]
In a 1990 article titled "The Core Competence of the Corporation", C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel illustrated that core competencies lead to the development of core products, which can further be used to build many other products for end users. Core competencies are developed through the process of continuous improvements over the period of time rather than a single large change. To succeed in an emerging global market, it is more important and required to build core competencies rather than to do vertical integration. For example, NEC utilized its portfolio of core competencies to dominate the semiconductor, telecommunications, and consumer electronics market.

For example, a company's core competencies may include precision mechanics, fine optics, and micro-electronics.These help it build cameras, but may also be useful in making other products that require these competencies.[1]
Value Migration: How to Think Several Moves Ahead of the Competition
A core competency is a concept in management theory introduced by C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel.[1] It can be defined as "a harmonized combination of multiple resources and skills that distinguish a firm in the marketplace" and therefore are the foundation of companies' competitiveness.[2]
Prahalad, C.K. and Hamel, G. (1990) "The core competence of the corporation Archived 2014-07-14 at the Wayback Machine", Harvard Business Review (v. 68, no. 3)pp. 79–91.
Importantly, according to C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel (1990) definition, core competencies are the "collective learning across the corporation". They can, therefore, not be applied to the SBU (strategic business unit) and represent resource combination steered from the corporate level. Because the term "core competence" is often confused with "something a company is particularly good at", some caution should be taken not to dilute the original meaning.
A core competency results from a specific set of skills or production techniques that deliver additional value to the customer. These enable an organization to access a wide variety of markets.
The use and understanding of the concept of core competences can be very important to enterprises. They can use core competences in order to excel at the contrivance of core products.[1] Enterprises could also use core competences to raise the values of customers and stakeholders.[3]
In a race to achieve cost cutting, quality, and productivity, most executives do not spend their time developing a corporate view of the future because this exercise demands high intellectual energy and commitment. The difficult questions may challenge their own ability to view the future opportunities but an attempt to find their answers will lead towards organizational benefits.

In late 2010 and early 2011, Aaron Swartz, an American computer programmer, writer, political organizer and Internet activist, used MIT's data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of JSTOR's collection of academic journal articles.[23][24] When the bulk-download was discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to film the mysterious visitor and the relevant computer was left untouched. Once video was captured of the visitor, the download was stopped and Swartz was identified. Rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him, in June 2011 JSTOR reached a settlement wherein Swartz surrendered the downloaded data.[23][24]

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded JSTOR initially. Until January 2009, JSTOR operated as an independent, self-sustaining nonprofit organization with offices in New York City and in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Then JSTOR merged with the nonprofit Ithaka Harbors, Inc.[12]—a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and "dedicated to helping the academic community take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies".[1]

The Swartz controversy and Greg Maxwell's protest torrent of the same content led JSTOR to "press ahead" with the initiative.[34][35] As of 2017[update], JSTOR does not have plans to extend it to other public domain content, stating that "We do not believe that just because something is in the public domain, it can always be provided for free".[37]

William G. Bowen, president of Princeton University from 1972 to 1988,[8] founded JSTOR in 1994. JSTOR was originally conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially research and university libraries, due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text searchability improved access dramatically.
JSTOR is licensed mainly to academic institutions, public libraries, research institutions, museums, and schools. More than 7,000 institutions in more than 150 countries have access.[4] JSTOR has been running a pilot program of allowing subscribing institutions to provide access to their alumni, in addition to current students and staff. The Alumni Access Program officially launched in January 2013.[19] Individual subscriptions also are available to certain journal titles through the journal publisher.[20] Every year, JSTOR blocks 150 million attempts by non-subscribers to read articles.[21]

Originally containing digitized back issues of academic journals, it now encompasses books and other primary sources as well as current issues of journals in the humanities and social sciences.[4] It provides full-text searches of almost 2,000 journals.

Swartz surrendered to authorities, pleaded not guilty to all counts, and was released on $100,000 bail. In September 2012, U.S. attorneys increased the number of charges against Swartz from four to thirteen, with a possible penalty of 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.[28][29] The case still was pending when Swartz committed suicide in January 2013.[30] Prosecutors dropped the charges after his suicide.[31]

JSTOR metadata is available through CrossRef and the Unpaywall dump,[45] which as of 2020 identifies nearly 3 million works hosted by JSTOR as toll access, as opposed to over 200,000 available in open access (mainly through third party open access repositories).
Inquiries have been made about the possibility of making JSTOR open access. According to Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, JSTOR had been asked "how much would it cost to make this available to the whole world, how much would we need to pay you? The answer was $250 million".[22]
