Months later, Rhya awakens after having dreams of his past with the Elf Tribe.[30] After the Royal Knights attack the floating dungeon, Rhya opens his third eye in preparation for the fight.[31] He disguises himself as Asta and sneaks into Mereoleona Vermillion's team. Both plead that they are the real Asta, so Mereoleona burns both of them. The real Asta survives due to his Anti Magic while Rhya is greatly hurt and has to put out the flames and heal himself. He compliments her beauty but dislikes her being a royal. He then attacks with copied Dark Magic, but she burns away his spell before dashing forward and engulfing him in flames.[32]

Living up to his title as the "Disloyal", Rhya can tell when another person is being deceptive. In fact, this trait allowed him to realize that there were inconsistencies in the Massacre of the Elf Tribe and later seeing Asta's ideals of a world of mutual understanding to be genuine.

However, she survives and attacks Rhya.[44]

Five centuries later, Patolli reincarnates Rhya in the body of a human and makes him one of the Eye of the Midnight Sun's Third Eye, with Vetto and Fana.[22]
Imitation Magic: Rhya uses this magic attribute to copy other magic. He needs to touch the grimoire of an individual in order to copy the spells.[17][80] He has copied several types of magic, and his copied spells are able to match those of the original owners.[81] However, he cannot copy Anti Magic[82] and is limited in how many different types of magic that he can use at one time.[83][84]

After his second reincarnation, Rhya's hair becomes white with black patches and his eyes turn gold. His ears become pointed, and his tattoo extends further down his jaw and up over his eye.[8][9]
Upon being fully resurrected, Rhya immediately attacks the Royal Knights with two different elements simultaneously. Mereoleona defends her teammates and counterattacks but Rhya evades. The elf fires multiple light beams through Myriad Black and manages to injure both Mereoleona and Asta. Their battle is interrupted when Lira, who is in Rill Boismortier's body, crashes through the ceiling.[39] Rhya joins Lira atop the Four-Headed Lindworm and watches Lira fight the Knights. In the battle, Zora tries to blind and paralyze the elves, providing Asta an opening to free Rill from possession, but Rhya explains that the spell is complete and cannot be nullified by Anti Magic.[40]

Ado then joins Rhya and Licht and creates doors for the other elves in the dungeon into the central room. The dungeon is then steered toward the Clover Kingdom and their revived brethren.[55] Rhya sends Ado and some others to find Yuno and retrieve the magic stone.[56][57] Within the dungeon, Vetto and Fana are reincarnated into artificial bodies, and Rhya arrives to greet them. After the two dress, Rhya takes them to get new grimoires.[58]

Furosemide should be used with caution when combined with corticosteroids (as this increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance), aminoglycoside antibiotics (increases risk of kidney or ear damage), and trimethoprim sulfa (causes decreased platelet count). It may also cause interactions with anesthetics, so its use should be related to the veterinarian if the animal is going into surgery, and it decreases the kidneys' ability to excrete aspirin, so dosages will need to be adjusted if combined with that drug.
The action on the distal tubules is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance. Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by development of acidosis, as it is with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.[citation needed]

Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting the luminal Na-K-Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, by binding to the chloride transport channel, thus causing more sodium, chloride, and potassium to be excreted in the urine.[32]
Furosemide is a known ototoxic agent generally causing transient hearing loss but can be permanent. Reported cases of furosemide induced hearing loss appeared to be associated with rapid intravenous administration, high dosages, concomitant renal disease and coadministration with other ototoxic medication.[27][28] However, a recently reported longitudinal study showed that participants treated with loop diuretics over 10 years were 40% more likely to develop hearing loss and 33% more likely of progressive hearing loss compared to participants who did not use loop diuretics.[29] This suggests the long-term consequences of loop diuretics on hearing could be a more significant than previously thought and further research is required in this area.

The diuretic effects are put to use most commonly in horses to prevent bleeding during a race. Sometime in the early 1970s, furosemide's ability to prevent, or at least greatly reduce, the incidence of bleeding (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) by horses during races was discovered accidentally.In the United States of America, pursuant to the racing rules of most states, horses that bleed from the nostrils three times are permanently barred from racing. Clinical trials followed, and by decade's end, racing commissions in some states in the USA began legalizing its use on race horses.In 1995, New York became the last state in the United States to approve such use, after years of refusing to consider doing so.[47] Some states allow its use for all racehorses; some allow it only for confirmed "bleeders".Its use for this purpose is still prohibited in many other countries.[citation needed]

Furosemide was patented in 1959 and approved for medical use in 1964.[5] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[6] In the United States, it is available as a generic medication.[3] In 2020, it was the nineteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 26 million prescriptions.[7][8] In 2020/21 it was the twentieth most prescribed medication in England.[9] It is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned drug list due to concerns that it may mask other drugs.[10] It has also been used in race horses for the treatment and prevention of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage.[11][12]

Common side effects include feeling lightheaded while standing, ringing in the ears, and sensitivity to light.[3] Potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, low blood pressure, and hearing loss.[3] Blood tests are recommended regularly for those on treatment.[3] Furosemide is a type of loop diuretic that works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys.[3] Common side effects of furosemide injection include hypokalemia (low potassium level), hypotension (low blood pressure), and dizziness.[4]

Furosemide is mainly excreted by tubular secretion in the kidney. In kidney impairment, clearance is reduced, increasing the risk of adverse effects.[3]Lower initial doses are recommended in older patients (to minimize side-effects) and high doses may be needed in kidney failure.[23] It can also cause kidney damage; this is mainly by loss of excessive fluid (i.e., dehydration), and is usually reversible.[citation needed]
Furosemide is also used for liver cirrhosis, kidney impairment, nephrotic syndrome, in adjunct therapy for swelling of the brain or lungs where rapid diuresis is required (IV injection), and in the management of severe hypercalcemia in combination with adequate rehydration.[20]

Furosemide is injected either intramuscularly or intravenously, usually 0.5-1.0 mg/kg twice/day, although less before a horse is raced. As with many diuretics, it can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including loss of potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Excessive use of furosemide will most likely lead to a metabolic alkalosis due to hypochloremia and hypokalemia. The drug should, therefore, not be used in horses that are dehydrated or experiencing kidney failure. It should be used with caution in horses with liver problems or electrolyte abnormalities. Overdose may lead to dehydration, change in drinking patterns and urination, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, kidney damage, lethargy, collapse, and coma.

Furosemide is primarily usedfor the treatment of edema, but also in some cases of hypertension (where there is also kidney or heart impairment).[13] It is often viewed as a first-line agent in most people with edema caused by congestive heart failure because of its anti-vasoconstrictor and diuretic effects.[14][3] Compared with furosemide, however, torasemide (aka "torsemide") has been demonstrated to show improvements to heart failure symptoms, possibly lowering the rates of rehospitalisation associated with heart failure, with no difference in risk of death. [15][16][17] Torsemide may also be safer than furosemide.[18][19]
Furosemide acts within 1 hour of oral administration (after IV injection, the peak effect is within 30 minutes). Diuresis is usually complete within 6–8 hours of oral administration, but there is significant variation between individuals.[24]

Additionally, furosemide is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors.[33][34][35] Furosemide has been reported to reversibly antagonize GABA-evoked currents of α6β2γ2 receptors at μM concentrations, but not α1β2γ2 receptors.[33][35] During development, the α6β2γ2 receptor increases in expression in cerebellar granule neurons, corresponding to increased sensitivity to furosemide.[34]

Baroque Hoedown was incorporated into the finale of Light Magic.
Light Magic was a "streetacular" (a portmanteau of "street" and "spectacular").[3] Floats moved into two performance zones, one located at the Small World Mall in Fantasyland, and the other on Main Street. Upon reaching the performance zones, the floats stopped and the pixie characters, who were the focus of the show, awakened and performed step-dancing routines for the audience, and were then joined by Disney characters. During the performance segment, a portion of each of the floats revealed a screen upon which images were projected from equipment hidden in the surrounding buildings. As part of the grand finale, the fairies used their 'magic' to throw pixie dust, confetti falls from the sky and the buildings light up with a shower of twinkling lights provided by fiber optics embedded in the structures.
Another spiritual successor to the Main Street Electrical Parade, the Paint the Night Parade, which also makes use of "Baroque Hoedown", premiered at Disneyland on May 22, 2015, as part of the park's 60th anniversary celebration.

Three towers constructed on Small World Mall for sound and lighting technician use in Light Magic are still standing. Two currently serve no explicit purpose, but their exterior facades are maintained. One has been returned to service as a projection tower for the park's fireworks shows.
Light Magic debuted to the general public on May 23, 1997 and played until September 1 of that year, with the majority of the response from the public ranging from lackluster to dislike.

Light Magic was a parade/street show that ran at Disneyland from May–September 1997.[2] It was billed as a replacement for the Main Street Electrical Parade. At the time of Light Magic's closure, Disney officially stated that it would return in 2000, but it ultimately did not return. Infrastructure improvements made specifically for Light Magic – particularly in Fantasyland – are still used today. The show utilized over 4500 miles of fiber optic cables, and 1520 strobe lights.
A walkway was added parallel to the parade route between Storybook Land Canal Boats and It's A Small World – landscaped to block the view of the parade route from the walkway – in order to allow guests to move in and out of the It's A Small World area during parades. This was added in response to crowded conditions for guests during the final months of the Main Street Electrical Parade's run.
In March 17th, 2013. Light Magic Music is also use in Disneyland Paris Saint Patrick's Fireworks.

Painted asphalt along the parade route was replaced with concrete to accommodate the large, heavy show platforms [5]
The passholders' response to Light Magic was negative, with long lines extending from Guest Relations at City Hall on Main Street demanding refunds, as passholders had paid $25 each to attend the special event under the impression, based on all of the information that had been distributed, that they would be the first to see the official premiere, not a dress rehearsal.
Light Magic made its debut on May 13, 1997 at a private event for Disneyland Annual Passholders. The premiere night did not go well as technical problems came up with aligning the floats with the projectors, various cues were missed, and sound equipment failed, as well as the fiber-optic lighting not yet being functional. The initial show was prefaced by then-Disneyland President Paul Pressler announcing to the crowd that the show was to be a dress rehearsal and not the show in its finished form.[4]
