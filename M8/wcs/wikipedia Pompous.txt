Civics represent the principles of life within an empire and are primarily limited by the authority and ethics an empire possesses. Each empire starts with up to two civics, and this limit is increased to three civics by researching the  Galactic Administration technology or its equivalent. Civics can be changed every 20 years by reforming the government spending  10 unity per empire size. If at any point a civic's requirements are no longer met due to a change in empire ethics or authority, it becomes "dormant" and provide no bonus until it's replaced or its requirements are met again.
