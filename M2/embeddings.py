Aim:
Construct a program to pick out words relating to human or personality traits.

Plan:
* Find pre-processed English literature `EL`
* Define the set `HPT` to contain words describing Human/Personality Traits
* Calculate the word embeddings/sense of the set `HPT`, as WE_HPT or WS_HPT.
* Use WX_HPT to pick out similar words found in the EL.
