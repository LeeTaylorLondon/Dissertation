`cosine_similarity.py` uses the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
and the gensim library to analyze the text of the book "The Great Gatsby".

The text is read, processed, and tokenized, splitting it into words
and sentences, then preprocesses the words by removing special characters
and making them all lowercase. From the preprocessed words a set
of words is made.

Next, a set of two words, "happy" and "sad", are the
seed words for extracting similar words.

A Word2Vec model is created, which is a type of neural
network for NLP, using the sentences from the book as training data.
The model is trained using parameters such as the minimum word
count, vector size, and window size.

Lastly the program calculates the similarity between each word in the set
of preprocessed words and each seed word, "happy" and "sad",
each word pair with a similarity score higher than the defined threshold
is added to the lexicon.
