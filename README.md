My Undergraduate dissertation project. 

### POA
'ACT-NBM by simplifying, decomposing, and organising.'

Next Steps (A):
    * [-] Download the top 10 to 20 most relevant papers on
    https://aclanthology.org/search/?q=lexicon+construction
    * [-] Download the top 10 to 20 most relevant papers on
    https://aclanthology.org/search/?q=lexicon+construction
    * [-] Download the top 10 to 20 most relevant papers on
    https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=lexicon+construction
    * [-] For my current papers from arVix and IEEE-Xplore
    relocate the same papers from 'peer-reviewed sources'
    * [-] From the large corpus of papers determine the best papers
    to reproduce as 'reproducibles' and justify why over other papers
    * [-] For each paper in 'reproducibles' reproduce the code
    and evaluation test if possible (start with 2 from each source
    where source = each website stated above)
    * [-] Test and evaluate each reproduced project for my own aim
    * [-] Determine the best reproduced project/method for my aim
    * [-] From the best reproduced project/method improve on their
    mentioned stated weaknesses

Next Steps (B):
    * [-] For my current papers from arVix and IEEE-Xplore
    relocate the same papers from 'peer-reviewed sources'
    * [-] From the large corpus of papers determine the best papers
    to reproduce as 'reproducibles' and justify why over other papers
    * [-] For each paper in 'reproducibles' reproduce the code
    and evaluation test if possible (start with 2 from each source
    where source = each website stated above)
    * [-] Test and evaluate each reproduced project for my own aim
    * [-] Follow 'Next Steps (A)' from this point or continue
    * [-] Determine the best reproduced project/method for my aim
    * [-] From the best reproduced project/method improve on their
    mentioned stated weaknesses

Goals:
    * [-] Overall goal: 'Present a systematic or thorough lit. review.'

    * [-] About my current lit. review take the best papers and find the
      originals from somewhere else then reproduce only the best

    * [-] Find papers in: '(ACL-based) TACL, NACL, ACL, ACM, (ACM-based)
        ACM, CIKM, CHIIR, etc.'.
        Don't use arXiv papers in the final thesis/dissertation.
    * [-] For each website download the top papers and other papers
        https://aclanthology.org/search/?q=lexicon+construction
        https://dl.acm.org/action/doSearch?AllField=lexicon+construction
        https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=lexicon+construction
    * Summarise each paper and justify why you chose the papers you did over the other papers

    * [-] Reproduce the code for the best papers
