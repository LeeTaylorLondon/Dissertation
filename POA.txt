'ACT-NBM by simplifying, decomposing, and organising.'
key: RPX = Reproducing-Paper-X, where X equals the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... nth paper.

Next Steps (RP1):
    * Create an enrichment corpus 160K sentences and 120K unique words
      * Only keep sentences of 10 words or more
      * Remove casing, special, and punctuation characters
    * Create a PT-HLA entity set containing only words directly related to PT-HLA
      * Derive synonyms from thesaurus.com (only with a relevance score of 1)
      (a pair of words w1 and w2 are strong synonyms if and only if w1 appears
      in the synonym list of w2 and w2 appears in the synonym list of w1)


Next Steps (A):
    * [-] Download the top 10 to 20 most relevant papers on
    https://aclanthology.org/search/?q=lexicon+construction
    * [-] Download the top 10 to 20 most relevant papers on
    https://aclanthology.org/search/?q=lexicon+construction
    * [-] Download the top 10 to 20 most relevant papers on
    https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=lexicon+construction
    * [-] For my current papers from arVix and IEEE-Xplore
    relocate the same papers from 'peer-reviewed sources'
    * [-] From the large corpus of papers determine the best papers
    to reproduce as 'reproducibles' and justify why over other papers
    * [-] For each paper in 'reproducibles' reproduce the code
    and evaluation test if possible (start with 2 from each source
    where source = each website stated above)
    * [-] Test and evaluate each reproduced project for my own aim
    * [-] Determine the best reproduced project/method for my aim
    * [-] From the best reproduced project/method improve on their
    mentioned stated weaknesses


Next Steps (B):
    * [-] For my current papers from arVix and IEEE-Xplore
    relocate the same papers from 'peer-reviewed sources'
    * [-] From the large corpus of papers determine the best papers
    to reproduce as 'reproducibles' and justify why over other papers
    * [-] For each paper in 'reproducibles' reproduce the code
    and evaluation test if possible (start with 2 from each source
    where source = each website stated above)
    * [-] Test and evaluate each reproduced project for my own aim
    * [-] Follow 'Next Steps (A)' from this point or continue
    * [-] Determine the best reproduced project/method for my aim
    * [-] From the best reproduced project/method improve on their
    mentioned stated weaknesses


Goals:
    * [-] Overall goal: 'Present a systematic or thorough lit. review.'

    * [-] About my current lit. review take the best papers and find the
      originals from somewhere else then reproduce only the best

    * [-] Find papers in: '(ACL-based) TACL, NACL, ACL, ACM, (ACM-based)
        ACM, CIKM, CHIIR, etc.'.
        Don't use arXiv papers in the final thesis/dissertation.
    * [-] For each website download the top papers and other papers
        https://aclanthology.org/search/?q=lexicon+construction
        https://dl.acm.org/action/doSearch?AllField=lexicon+construction
        https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=lexicon+construction
    * Summarise each paper and justify why you chose the papers you did over the other papers

    * [-] Reproduce the code for the best papers
