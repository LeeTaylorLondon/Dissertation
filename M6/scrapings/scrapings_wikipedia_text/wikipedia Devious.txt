The first season premiered on June 23, 2013, and introduces the four central characters of the show: Marisol Duarte (Ana Ortiz), Rosie Falta (Dania Ramirez), Carmen Luna (Roselyn Sanchez) and Zoila Diaz (Judy Reyes), as well as their rich employers in the town of Beverly Hills. The main mystery of the season is the sudden murder of fellow maid Flora Hernandez (Paula Garces), and the involvement of her employers Evelyn (Rebecca Wisocky) and Adrian Powell (Tom Irwin) in the events leading up to it. Once an English professor, Marisol takes a job as Taylor (Brianna Brown) and Michael Stappord's (Brett Cullen) maid in order to get close to Flora's old friends and prove her son's (Eddie Hassell) innocence of the crime; Rosie works for actors Peri (Mariana Klaveno) and Spence Westmore (Grant Show), though eventually enters into an affair with the latter; Carmen takes a job for singer Alejandro Rubio (Matt Cedeño) in hopes of him making her a star while dodging the feelings of her co-worker, Sam (Wolé Parks); and Zoila tries to prevent her daughter Valentina (Edy Ganem) from being with her boss Genevieve Delatour's (Susan Lucci) son, Remi (Drew Van Acker).

The plot is based on the Mexican TV series Ellas son... la Alegría del Hogar, which translates in English as "They Are... the Joy of the Place" and was heavily influenced by Cherry's previous series Desperate Housewives. The Mexican series is based on an original concept by Gloria Calzada, Juan Meyer, and Salvador Rizo. The American adaptation was to follow four maids with ambition and dreams of their own while they work for the rich and famous in Beverly Hills, California. ABC ordered the pilot on January 31, 2012.[10] Actress Eva Longoria was announced as an executive producer on March 26.[11] She had worked previously with Cherry on Desperate Housewives, and was hired to add perspective to the Latina roles.[12] ABC Studios gave Cherry permission to start making senior staffing offers for the show on May 1, which was perceived as an indication that the show would be picked up.[13]

The fourth and final season premiered on June 6, 2016, and its main mystery is the sudden murder of Peri Westmore, and the involvement of a cult known as "The Circle" in the events leading up to it. Rosie takes charge in the investigation when Spence is wrongly incarcerated for the crime while also working two jobs, one as Genevieve's new maid and the other as Peri and Spence's son's (Carter Birchwell) nanny when Peri's sister Shannon (Katherine LaNasa) gets custody of him. Zoila has permanently quit being Genevieve's maid following the loss of her child when in labor, but due to the absence of her new employer (Kate Beahan) she's able to masquerade as a Beverly Hills' socialite and land a new man - Kyle (Ryan McPartlin) - who has an extremely close bond with his mother (Stephanie Faracy), the secret leader of "The Circle". Marisol's book is in the process of being made into a movie which leads her into the arms of studio head Peter Hudson (James Denton), but continues to have lingering feelings for Jesse, who has a fling with Danni (Sol Rodríguez), Carmen's daughter that she gave away at birth and now is starting to build a relationship with. Meanwhile, Adrian goes to great lengths to try and win Evelyn back who's moved in with and began working for Marisol on her journey to getting a divorce.

Carpenter) money.

Spence's nephew Ty (Gideon Glick) later comes for an extended visit and develops and unhealthy obsession for Carmen.

She soon takes on new lover Javier (Ivan Hernandez), while Valentina goes to work for the Powells and takes on new lover Ethan (Colin Woodell), who secretly takes part in a gang of teens who go around robbing houses.

In early February, Carlos Ponce was announced to play Ben who is the manager of a famous movie star, but also a dangerous-yet-handsome thirty-something who specializes in manipulating people. He's also described as charming and mysterious. Carter Birchwell was assigned to play Spence and Peri's son Tucker. Katherine LaNasa will play Shannon Greene, Peri's older sister. In addition, Argentinian actress Sol Rodríguez would recur as Daniela while Nathan Owens has been promoted as a series regular.[49]
