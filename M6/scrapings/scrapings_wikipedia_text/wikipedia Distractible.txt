Fischbach first joined YouTube on March 6, 2012, creating a channel under the username "Markiplier", and uploaded his first video on April 4, 2012.[14] Fischbach's original intent for the channel was sketch comedy where he would be portraying all of the characters in the sketches.[15] This led to the creation of the name "Markiplier", a portmanteau of Mark and multiplier.[15] Fischbach's first series was a playthrough of the video game Amnesia: The Dark Descent. After playing several other game series, including Penumbra and Dead Space, YouTube banned Fischbach's AdSense account, and he created a new channel on May 26, 2012, markiplierGAME.[16]
