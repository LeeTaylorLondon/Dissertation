Justifications are frequently the exercise of official duties like statements during trial and the scope of civil rights and liberties, which notably includes freedom of speech e.g. in politics, science, arts or literature or some kinds of activities in those. Very narrowly, the self-defense of honor may function as a justification but reciprocal insults are not considered as self-defenses of honor. Authoritarian or one-party states are not expected to allow for criticism of their governing and politics when it comes to insult.

Insult is reserved to countries of civil law but a similar behavior in public can be considered public disorder in common law, especially in that of the United Kingdom[7] and former colonies of the British Empire after 1776.[8] The difference is that in civil law there is a personal target and the damaged legal good is their honor but in common law the public is targeted and the damaged legal good is the public order. The unlikeness persists also in public insults of civil law.

Elizabethans took great interest in such analyses, distinguishing out, for example, the "fleering frump ... when we give a mock with a scornful countenance as in some smiling sort looking aside or by drawing the lip awry, or shrinking up the nose".[20] Shakespeare humorously set up an insult-hierarchy of seven-fold "degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct".[21]
An insult is an expression or statement (or sometimes behavior) which is disrespectful or scornful. Insults may be intentional or accidental.[1] An insult may be factual, but at the same time pejorative, such as the word "inbred".[2]
What qualifies as an insult is also determined both by the individual social situation and by changing social mores. Thus on one hand the insulting "obscene invitations of a man to a strange girl can be the spicy endearments of a husband to his wife".[22]

Various typologies of insults have been proposed over the years.

Insults in poetic form is practiced through out history, more often as entertainment rather then maliciousness. Flyting is a contest consisting of the exchange of insults between two parties, often conducted in verse and became public entertainment in Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries.[15] Senna is a form of Old Norse Eddic poetry consisting of an exchange of insults between participants.[16]

Negging is a type of backhanded compliment used for emotional manipulation or as a seduction method. The term was coined and prescribed by pickup artists.[8] Negging is often viewed as a straightforward insult rather than as a pick-up line,[9] in spite of the fact that proponents of the technique traditionally stress it is not an insult.
Lacan considered insults a primary form of social interaction, central to the imaginary order – "a situation that is symbolized in the 'Yah-boo, so are you' of the transitivist quarrel, the original form of aggressive communication".[clarification needed][3]

A personal attack is an insult which is directed at some attribute of the person.
Examples of backhanded compliments include, but are not limited to:
Verbal insults often take a phallic or pudendal form; this includes offensive profanity,[12][13] and may also include insults to one's sexuality. There are also insults pertaining to the extent of one's sexual activity. For example, according to James Bloodworth, "incel" “has gradually crept into the vocabulary of every internet troll, sometimes being used against men who blame and harass women for not wanting to sleep with them.” [14]
