After a long hiatus, they changed recording company (from Talent - Microfón to multinational CBS) and announced their second LP, Durazno Sangrando in 1975. The premiere took place in the Teatro Coliseo on 21 and 22 November that year. A cover version of "Amor de primavera," a song originally composed and performed by Tanguito, was Invisible's only sign of activity until the release of their third and last LP, El jardín de los presentes, in which the band incorporated Tomás Gubitsch on lead guitar. The album obtained massive success almost immediately[citation needed] and contains "El Anillo del Capitán Beto", considered a classic of Argentine rock.[1] The album also featured a guest appearance by bandoneón virtuoso Rodolfo Mederos on "Las Golondrinas de Plaza de Mayo". The new material included in this LP would be first performed live on 6 August 1976 in the Estadio Luna Park. About "El Anillo del Capitán Beto," Spinetta once said:
Invisible's first live performance took place at the Teatro Astral on 23 November 1973. The following year, they recorded their first single and their first album, self-titled Invisible. The group secluded more and more in their rehearsals and dropped live performances in small places; they only performed in big theaters or stadiums, but never in festivals.

Invisible was an Argentine band formed by Luis Alberto Spinetta following the breakup of Pescado Rabioso in 1973 and the release of Artaud. The original lineup of the band was completed by Carlos "Machi" Rufino (bass, backing vocals) and Héctor "Pomo" Lorenzo (drums), both of whom conformed Pappo's Blues' rhythm section at the time. From 1976 until their breakup a year later, the band expanded into a quartet with the inclusion of guitarist Tomás Gubitsch.
Invisible had its last concert on 12 December 1976 in the Luna Park. In early 1977, the group disbanded due to the different opinions among its members on which musical style to follow.
In the Spinetta y las Bandas Eternas concert of 2009 - a retrospective of Spinetta's career in which he brought together the bands that accompanied him over 40 years-Invisible played 5 songs: "Durazno sangrando", "Jugo de lúcuma", "Lo que nos ocupa es la conciencia, es la abuela que regula el mundo", "Niño condenado" and "Amor de primavera".

"I remember myself with Pomo and Machi, having a great time in the coffee shop that was next to Teatro Astral and thinking of possible names for that astronaut who has gone through the fight of ages (in Spanish: lucha de las eras)... Las eras... Las Heras y Bustamante (an intersection in Buenos Aires). I imagined that his spaceship was similar to the DeLorean of Back to the Future, or something like that, that took off due to a science that only Beto understands, and goes far away... Actually, Beto does not want to come back. He has conquered something impressive but, as any conqueror, he can't avoid comparison and distance to the world he left behind."

Outside of the band endeavours, members have embarked on production and session work. Dave Okumu has co-written and produced South London singer Jessie Ware's debut album, Devotion, which was later recognised as Album of the Year (2012) by the Mercury Prize.[13][14] Okumu has performed and recorded with many artists such as Amy Winehouse, St. Vincent, Jane Birkin, Sara Creative Partners, Brigitte Fontaine, Theo Parrish, Tony Allen, King Sunny Adé, Omar, Matthew Herbert, Dani Siciliano, Toddla T, Bilal, Jack De Johnette, Róisín Murphy, Rosie Lowe and Anna Calvi.[15] Tom Herbert continues to play as part of post-jazz band Polar Bear; Leo Taylor has contributed drums for Jessie Ware's second single "Running", Kate Nash's album "Made of Bricks", Kano's album "Home Sweet Home" and Adele's second album 21, including its leading single "Rolling In The Deep".[16] The band also played on Adele's 2012 James Bond theme, Skyfall.[17]

The Invisible began in 2006 with Okumu, who – encouraged by Matthew Herbert to record solo material – soon realised he required the input of friends Leo Taylor (formerly of Gramme and Zongamin) and Tom Herbert (a member of Polar Bear (British band) and Acoustic Ladyland) to make real the sounds inside his head. Herbert's Accidental Records spawned the production of the band's first official release, the one-track 7 inch vinyl "Constant" in early 2008.[4]

The Invisible are an English band, fronted by the singer and guitarist Dave Okumu. The band formed as Okumu's solo project but quickly developed into a full-fledged band with friends Tom Herbert (bass, keyboards) and Leo Taylor (drums). Their self-titled debut album, released on 9 March 2009, was nominated for the Mercury Prize[2] and selected as critics choice for iTunes album of the year.[3]

In filmmaking, people, objects, or backgrounds can be made to look invisible on camera through a process known as chroma keying. An artificially made meta material that is invisible to the microwave spectrum.
Pendry, who theorized the invisibility cloak "as a joke" to illustrate the potential of metamaterials, said in an interview in August 2011 that grand, theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown: "I think it’s pretty sure that any cloak that Harry Potter would recognize is not on the table. You could dream up some theory, but the very practicality of making it would be so impossible. But can you hide things from light? Yes. Can you hide things which are a few centimeters across? Yes. Is the cloak really flexible and flappy? No. Will it ever be? No. So you can do quite a lot of things, but there are limitations. There are going to be some disappointed kids around, but there might be a few people in industry who are very grateful for it."[12]

Invisibility in the real world Interesting picture of a test tube's bottom half invisible in cooking oil.
Invisibility perception depends on several optical and visual factors.[1] For example, invisibility depends on the eyes of the observer and/or the instruments used. Thus an object can be classified as "invisible to" a person, animal, instrument, etc. In research on sensorial perception it has been shown that invisibility is perceived in cycles.[2]

In some works, the power of magic creates an effective means of invisibility by distracting anyone who might notice the character. But since the character is not truly invisible, the effect could be betrayed by mirrors or other reflective surfaces.
Engineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility (cloaks) for objects. Methods are typically based on implementing the theoretical techniques of transformation optics, which have given rise to several theories of cloaking.
Magical potions can be consumed to grant temporary or permanent invisibility.

Physics World special issue on invisibility science - July 2011
Since objects can be seen by light in the visible spectrum from a source reflecting off their surfaces and hitting the viewer's eye, the most natural form of invisibility (whether real or fictional) is an object that neither reflects nor absorbs light (that is, it allows light to pass through it). This is known as transparency, and is seen in many naturally occurring materials (although no naturally occurring material is 100% transparent).
In illusion optics, invisibility is a special case of illusion effects: the illusion of free space.
In fiction, people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means:

In 2019, Hyperstealth Biotechnology has patented the technology behind a material that bends light to make people and objects near invisible to the naked eye. The material, called Quantum Stealth, is currently still in the prototyping stage, but was developed by the company's CEO Guy Cramer primarily for military purposes, to conceal agents and equipment such as tanks and jets in the field. Unlike traditional camouflage materials, which are limited to specific conditions such as forests or deserts, according to Cramer this "invisibility cloak" works in any environment or season, at any time of day.[13] Cramer graduated from the British Columbia Institute of Technology and was a former Youth Group pastor.[14]

In Turkey in 2009, Bilkent UniversitySearch Center Of Nanotechnology researches explained and published in New Journal of Physics that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc. next to perfect transparent scene by producing nanotechnologic material that can also be produced like a suit anyone can wear.
UC Berkeley researcher Jason Valentine's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum, in a region used in fibre optics: 'Instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water, it would actually appear to be above the water's surface. It's kind of weird. For a metamaterial to produce negative refraction, it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used." Valentine's team created their 'fishnet' material by stacking silver and metal dielectric layers on top of each other and then punching holes through them. The other team used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This material refracts visible light.
Invisibility is often considered to be the supreme form of camouflage, as it does not reveal to the viewer any kind of vital signs, visual effects, or anyfrequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum detectable to the human eye, instead making use of radio, infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.
A person can be described as invisible if others refuse to see them or routinely overlook them. The term was used in this manner in the title of the book Invisible Man, by Ralph Ellison, in reference to the protagonist, likely modeled after the author, being overlooked on account of his status as an African American. This is supported by the quote taken from the Prologue, "I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me." (Prologue.1)[15]

The term is often used in fantasy and science fiction, where objects cannot be seen by means of magic or hypothetical technology.
Technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible.

Two teams of scientists worked separately to create two "Invisibility Cloaks" from 'metamaterials' engineered at the nanoscale level. They demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional (3-D) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar, light or other waves around an object. While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the University of California, Berkeley said: "In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock. An observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it, making it seem to disappear."

Magical objects such as rings, cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility (or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off).
Currently, a practical cloaking device does not exist.[5][6] A 2006 theoretical work predicts that the imperfections are minor, and metamaterials may make real-life "cloaking devices" practical.[7][8] The technique is predicted to be applied to radio waves within five years, and the distortion of visible light is an eventual possibility. The theory that light waves can be acted upon the same way as radio waves is now a popular idea among scientists. The agent can be compared to a stone in a river, around which water passes, but slightly down-stream leaves no trace of the stone. Comparing light waves to the water, and whatever object that is being "cloaked" to the stone, the goal is to have light waves pass around that object, leaving no visible aspects of it, possibly not even a shadow.[9] This is the technique depicted in the 2000 television portrayal of The Invisible Man.

Making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display, it is possible to create a see-through effect. This is known as active camouflage. Though stealth technology is declared to be invisible to radar, all officially disclosed applications of the technology can only reduce the size and/or clarity of the signature detected by radar.

Where magical invisibility is concerned, the issue may arise of whether the clothing worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible. In general they are also regarded as being invisible, but in some instances clothing remains visible and must be removed for the full invisibility effect.
