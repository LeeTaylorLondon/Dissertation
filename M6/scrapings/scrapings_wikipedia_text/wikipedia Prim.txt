Beyond mathematics and computing, prime numbers have potential connections to quantum mechanics, and have been used metaphorically in the arts and literature.They have also been used in evolutionary biology to explain the life cycles of cicadas.
A commutative ring is an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined. The integers are a ring, and the prime numbers in the integers have been generalized to rings in two different ways, prime elements and irreducible elements. An element p{\displaystyle p} of a ring R{\displaystyle R} is called prime if it is nonzero, has no multiplicative inverse (that is, it is not a unit), and satisfies the following requirement: whenever p{\displaystyle p} divides the product xy{\displaystyle xy} of two elements of R{\displaystyle R}, it also divides at least one of x{\displaystyle x} or y{\displaystyle y}. An element is irreducible if it is neither a unit nor the product of two other non-unit elements. In the ring of integers, the prime and irreducible elements form the same set,

The concept of a prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, "prime" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field of a given field is its smallest subfield that contains both 0 and 1. It is either the field of rational numbers or a finite field with a prime number of elements, whence the name.[164] Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the connected sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.[165] The prime decomposition of 3-manifolds is another example of this type.[166]

In his science fiction novel Contact, scientist Carl Sagan suggested that prime factorization could be used as a means of establishing two-dimensional image planes in communications with aliens, an idea that he had first developed informally with American astronomer Frank Drake in 1975.[181] In the novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon, the narrator arranges the sections of the story by consecutive prime numbers as a way to convey the mental state of its main character, a mathematically gifted teen with Asperger syndrome.[182] Prime numbers are used as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation in the Paolo Giordano novel The Solitude of Prime Numbers, in which they are portrayed as "outsiders" among integers.[183]

For instance, Beiler writes that number theorist Ernst Kummer loved his ideal numbers, closely related to the primes, "because they had not soiled themselves with any practical applications",[30] and Katz writes that Edmund Landau, known for his work on the distribution of primes, "loathed practical applications of mathematics", and for this reason avoided subjects such as geometry that had already shown themselves to be useful.[31]

The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada makes use of prime numbers.[176] These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. Biologists theorize that these prime-numbered breeding cycle lengths have evolved in order to prevent predators from synchronizing with these cycles.[177][178]In contrast, the multi-year periods between flowering in bamboo plants are hypothesized to be smooth numbers, having only small prime numbers in their factorizations.[179]
Several theorems about primes can be formulated using modular arithmetic. For instance, Fermat's little theorem states that ifa≢0{\displaystyle a\not \equiv 0} (mod p{\displaystyle p}), then ap−1≡1{\displaystyle a^{p-1}\equiv 1} (mod p{\displaystyle p}).[101]Summing this over all choices of a{\displaystyle a} gives the equation

Some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations are based on Euclid's lemma: If p{\displaystyle p} is a prime number and p{\displaystyle p} divides a product ab{\displaystyle ab} of integers a{\displaystyle a} and b,{\displaystyle b,} then p{\displaystyle p} divides a{\displaystyle a} or p{\displaystyle p} divides b{\displaystyle b} (or both).[47] Conversely, if a number p{\displaystyle p} has the property that when it divides a product it always divides at least one factor of the product, then p{\displaystyle p} must be prime.[48]

Around 1000 AD, the Islamic mathematician Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) found Wilson's theorem, characterizing the prime numbers as the numbers n{\displaystyle n} that evenly divide (n−1)!+1{\displaystyle (n-1)!+1}. He also conjectured that all even perfect numbers come from Euclid's construction using Mersenne primes, but was unable to prove it.[17] Another Islamic mathematician, Ibn al-Banna' al-Marrakushi, observed that the sieve of Eratosthenes can be sped up by considering only the prime divisors up to the square root of the upper limit.[16] Fibonacci took the innovations from Islamic mathematics to Europe. His book Liber Abaci (1202) was the first to describe trial division for testing primality, again using divisors only up to the square root.[16]

The Riemann hypothesis states that the zeros of the zeta-function are all either negative even numbers, or complex numbers with real part equal to 1/2.[92]The original proof of the prime number theorem was based on a weak form of this hypothesis, that there are no zeros with real part equal to 1,[93][94] although other more elementary proofs have been found.[95]The prime-counting function can be expressed by Riemann's explicit formula as a sum in which each term comes from one of the zeros of the zeta function; the main term of this sum is the logarithmic integral, and the remaining terms cause the sum to fluctuate above and below the main term.[96]In this sense, the zeros control how regularly the prime numbers are distributed. If the Riemann hypothesis is true, these fluctuations will be small, and theasymptotic distribution of primes given by the prime number theorem will also hold over much shorter intervals (of length about the square root of x{\displaystyle x} for intervals near a number x{\displaystyle x}).[94]

This area of study began with Leonhard Euler and his first major result, the solution to the Basel problem.The problem asked for the value of the infinite sum 1+14+19+116+…,{\displaystyle 1+{\tfrac {1}{4}}+{\tfrac {1}{9}}+{\tfrac {1}{16}}+\dots ,}which today can be recognized as the value ζ(2){\displaystyle \zeta (2)} of the Riemann zeta function. This function is closely connected to the prime numbers and to one of the most significant unsolved problems in mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis. Euler showed that ζ(2)=π2/6{\displaystyle \zeta (2)=\pi ^{2}/6}.[71]The reciprocal of this number, 6/π2{\displaystyle 6/\pi ^{2}}, is the limiting probability that two random numbers selected uniformly from a large range are relatively prime (have no factors in common).[72]

Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number,[36][37] so they could not consider its primality. A few scholars in the Greek and later Roman tradition, including Nicomachus, Iamblichus, Boethius, and Cassiodorus also considered the prime numbers to be a subdivision of the odd numbers, so they did not consider 2 to be prime either. However, Euclid and a majority of the other Greek mathematicians considered 2 as prime. The medieval Islamic mathematicians largely followed the Greeks in viewing 1 as not being a number.[36]By the Middle Ages and Renaissance, mathematicians began treating 1 as a number, and some of them included it as the first prime number.[38] In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as prime in his correspondence with Leonhard Euler; however, Euler himself did not consider 1 to be prime.[39] In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered 1 to be prime,[40] and lists of primes that included 1 continued to be published as recently as 1956.[41][42]

Before computers, mathematical tables listing all of the primes or prime factorizations up to a given limit were commonly printed.[122] The oldest method for generating a list of primes is called the sieve of Eratosthenes.[123] The animation shows an optimized variant of this method.[124]Another more asymptotically efficient sieving method for the same problem is the sieve of Atkin.[125] In advanced mathematics, sieve theory applies similar methods to other problems.[126]

There is no known efficient formula for primes.For example, there is no non-constant polynomial, even in several variables, that takes only prime values.[54]However, there are numerous expressions that do encode all primes, or only primes. One possible formula is based on Wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.[55]There is also a set of Diophantine equations in nine variables and one parameter with the following property: the parameter is prime if and only if the resulting system of equations has a solution over the natural numbers. This can be used to obtain a single formula with the property that all its positive values are prime.[54]

In the theory of finite groups the Sylow theorems imply that, if a power of a prime number pn{\displaystyle p^{n}} divides the order of a group, then the group has a subgroup of order pn{\displaystyle p^{n}}. By Lagrange's theorem, any group of prime order is a cyclic group,and by Burnside's theorem any group whose order is divisible by only two primes is solvable.[116]

The property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number n{\displaystyle n}, called trial division, tests whether n{\displaystyle n} is a multiple of any integer between 2 and n{\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}}. Faster algorithms include the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers. As of December 2018[update] the largest known prime number is a Mersenne prime with 24,862,048 decimal digits.[1]

Beginning with the work of Hugh Montgomery and Freeman Dyson in the 1970s, mathematicians and physicists have speculated that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are connected to the energy levels of quantum systems.[172][173] Prime numbers are also significant in quantum information science, thanks to mathematical structures such as mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures.[174][175]

The Ulam spiral arranges the natural numbers in a two-dimensional grid, spiraling in concentric squares surrounding the origin with the prime numbers highlighted. Visually, the primes appear to cluster on certain diagonals and not others, suggesting that some quadratic polynomials take prime values more often than others.[88]
Other examples of prime-generating formulas come from Mills' theorem and a theorem of Wright.These assert that there are real constants A>1{\displaystyle A>1} and μ{\displaystyle \mu } such that

Prime numbers have influenced many artists and writers.The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through "natural phenomena". In works such as La Nativité du Seigneur (1935) and Quatre études de rythme (1949–50), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in the third étude, "Neumes rythmiques". According to Messiaen this way of composing was "inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations".[180]

of prime numbers never ends. This statement is referred to as Euclid's theorem in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, since the first known proof for this statement is attributed to him. Many more proofs of the infinitude of primes are known, including an analytical proof by Euler, Goldbach's proof based on Fermat numbers,[49] Furstenberg's proof using general topology,[50] and Kummer's elegant proof.[51]

For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of mathematics[b] other than the use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly.[117] In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.[118]

The divisors of a natural number n{\displaystyle n} are the natural numbers that divide n{\displaystyle n} evenly.Every natural number has both 1 and itself as a divisor. If it has any other divisor, it cannot be prime. This leads to an equivalent definition of prime numbers: they are the numbers with exactly two positive divisors. Those two are 1 and the number itself. As 1 has only one divisor, itself, it is not prime by this definition.[6]Yet another way to express the same thing is that a number n{\displaystyle n} is prime if it is greater than one and if none of the numbers 2,3,…,n−1{\displaystyle 2,3,\dots ,n-1} divides n{\displaystyle n} evenly.[7]

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold (by definition) in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z[i]{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [i]}, the ring of complex numbers of the form a+bi{\displaystyle a+bi} where i{\displaystyle i} denotes the imaginary unit and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every number that is prime among the integers remains prime in the Gaussian integers; for instance, the number 2 can be written as a product of the two Gaussian primes 1+i{\displaystyle 1+i} and 1−i{\displaystyle 1-i}. Rational primes (the prime elements in the integers) congruent to 3 mod 4 are Gaussian primes, but rational primes congruent to 1 mod 4 are not.[109] This is a consequence of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares,which states that an odd prime p{\displaystyle p} is expressible as the sum of two squares, p=x2+y2{\displaystyle p=x^{2}+y^{2}}, and therefore factorable as p=(x+iy)(x−iy){\displaystyle p=(x+iy)(x-iy)}, exactly when p{\displaystyle p} is 1 mod 4.[110]

Euler showed that, for any arbitrary real number x{\displaystyle x}, there exists a prime p{\displaystyle p} for which this sum is bigger than x{\displaystyle x}.[73] This shows that there are infinitely many primes, because if there were finitely many primes the sum would reach its maximum value at the biggest prime rather than growing past every x{\displaystyle x}.The growth rate of this sum is described more precisely by Mertens' second theorem.[74] For comparison, the sum

Because both the modulus 9 and the remainder 3 are multiples of 3, so is every element in the sequence. Therefore, this progression contains only one prime number, 3 itself.

Since 1951 all the largest known primes have been found using these tests on computers.[a] The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles, through the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and other distributed computing projects.[8][29] The idea that prime numbers had few applications outside of pure mathematics[b] was shattered in the 1970s when public-key cryptography and the RSA cryptosystem were invented, using prime numbers as their basis.[32]

If the definition of a prime number were changed to call 1 a prime, many statements involving prime numbers would need to be reworded in a more awkward way. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic would need to be rephrased in terms of factorizations into primes greater than 1, because every number would have multiple factorizations with any number of copies of 1.[40] Similarly, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if it handled 1 as a prime, because it would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and output only the single number 1.[42] Some other more technical properties of prime numbers also do not hold for the number 1: for instance, the formulas for Euler's totient function or for the sum of divisors function are different for prime numbers than they are for 1.[43] By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to agree that 1 should not be listed as prime, but rather in its own special category as a "unit".[40]

Several historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved. These include Goldbach's conjecture, that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the twin prime conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them. Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. In abstract algebra, objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include prime elements and prime ideals.
This picture of an order, absolute value, and complete field derived from them can be generalized to algebraic number fields and their valuations (certain mappings from the multiplicative group of the field to a totally ordered additive group, also called orders), absolute values (certain multiplicative mappings from the field to the real numbers, also called norms),[104] and places (extensions to complete fields in which the given field is a dense set, also called completions).[106] The extension from the rational numbers to the real numbers, for instance, is a place in which the distance between numbers is the usual absolute value of their difference. The corresponding mapping to an additive group would be the logarithm of the absolute value, although this does not meet all the requirements of a valuation. According to Ostrowski's theorem, up to a natural notion of equivalence, the real numbers and p{\displaystyle p}-adic numbers, with their orders and absolute values, are the only valuations, absolute values, and places on the rational numbers.[104] The local-global principle allows certain problems over the rational numbers to be solved by piecing together solutions from each of their places, again underlining the importance of primes to number theory.[107]

In an arbitrary ring, all prime elements are irreducible. The converse does not hold in general, but does hold for unique factorization domains.[108]
In addition to the aforementioned tests that apply to any natural number, some numbers of a special form can be tested for primality more quickly.For example, the Lucas–Lehmer primality test can determine whether a Mersenne number (one less than a power of two) is prime, deterministically,in the same time as a single iteration of the Miller–Rabin test.[137] This is why since 1992 (as of December 2018[update]) the largest known prime has always been a Mersenne prime.[138]It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.[139]

Many conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood proof for decades: all four of Landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved.[57] One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n{\displaystyle n} greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes.[58] As of 2014[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n=4⋅1018.{\displaystyle n=4\cdot 10^{18}.}[59] Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example, Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes.[60] Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes).[61] Also, any even integer greater than 10 can be written as the sum of six primes.[62] The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory.[63]

In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat's little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler).[18] Fermat also investigated the primality of the Fermat numbers22n+1{\displaystyle 2^{2^{n}}+1},[19] and Marin Mersenne studied the Mersenne primes, prime numbers of the form 2p−1{\displaystyle 2^{p}-1} with p{\displaystyle p} itself a prime.[20] Christian Goldbach formulated Goldbach's conjecture, that every even number is the sum of two primes, in a 1742 letter to Euler.[21] Euler proved Alhazen's conjecture (now the Euclid–Euler theorem) that all even perfect numbers can be constructed from Mersenne primes.[14] He introduced methods from mathematical analysis to this area in his proofs of the infinitude of the primes and the divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes 12+13+15+17+111+⋯{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\tfrac {1}{3}}+{\tfrac {1}{5}}+{\tfrac {1}{7}}+{\tfrac {1}{11}}+\cdots }.[22]At the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss conjectured that as x{\displaystyle x} tends to infinity, the number of primes up to x{\displaystyle x} is asymptotic to x/log⁡x{\displaystyle x/\log x}, where log⁡x{\displaystyle \log x} is the natural logarithm of x{\displaystyle x}. A weaker consequence of this high density of primes was Bertrand's postulate, that for every n>1{\displaystyle n>1} there is a prime between n{\displaystyle n} and 2n{\displaystyle 2n}, proved in 1852 by Pafnuty Chebyshev.[23] Ideas of Bernhard Riemann in his 1859 paper on the zeta-function sketched an outline for proving the conjecture of Legendre and Gauss. Although the closely related Riemann hypothesis remains unproven, Riemann's outline was completed in 1896 by Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin, and the result is now known as the prime number theorem.[24] Another important 19th century result was Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, that certain arithmetic progressions contain infinitely many primes.[25]

The increased practical importance of computerized primality testing and factorization led to the development of improved methods capable of handling large numbers of unrestricted form.[15][33][34] The mathematical theory of prime numbers also moved forward with the Green–Tao theorem (2004) that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers, and Yitang Zhang's 2013 proof that there exist infinitely many prime gaps of bounded size.[35]

Not every ring is a unique factorization domain. For instance, in the ring of numbers a+b−5{\displaystyle a+b{\sqrt {-5}}} (for integers a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}) the number 21{\displaystyle 21} has two factorizations 21=3⋅7=(1+2−5)(1−2−5){\displaystyle 21=3\cdot 7=(1+2{\sqrt {-5}})(1-2{\sqrt {-5}})}, where neither of the four factors can be reduced any further, so it does not have a unique factorization. In order to extend unique factorization to a larger class of rings, the notion of a number can be replaced with that of an ideal, a subset of the elements of a ring that contains all sums of pairs of its elements, and all products of its elements with ring elements.Prime ideals, which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), ... The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker–Noether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals, which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers.[111]
The spectrum of a ring is a geometric space whose points are the prime ideals of the ring.[112] Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry. These concepts can even assist with in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the existence of square roots modulo integer prime numbers.[113]Early attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem led to Kummer's introduction of regular primes, integer prime numbers connected with the failure of unique factorization in the cyclotomic integers.[114]The question of how many integer prime numbers factor into a product of multiple prime ideals in an algebraic number field is addressed by Chebotarev's density theorem, which (when applied to the cyclotomic integers) has Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions as a special case.[115]

The p{\displaystyle p}-adic order νp(n){\displaystyle \nu _{p}(n)} of an integer n{\displaystyle n} is the number of copies of p{\displaystyle p} in the prime factorization of n{\displaystyle n}. The same concept can be extended from integers to rational numbers by defining the p{\displaystyle p}-adic order of a fraction m/n{\displaystyle m/n} to be νp(m)−νp(n){\displaystyle \nu _{p}(m)-\nu _{p}(n)}. The p{\displaystyle p}-adic absolute value |q|p{\displaystyle |q|_{p}} of any rational number q{\displaystyle q} is then defined as|q|p=p−νp(q){\displaystyle |q|_{p}=p^{-\nu _{p}(q)}}. Multiplying an integer by its p{\displaystyle p}-adic absolute value cancels out the factors of p{\displaystyle p} in its factorization, leaving only the other primes. Just as the distance between two real numbers can be measured by the absolute value of their distance, the distance between two rational numbers can be measured by their p{\displaystyle p}-adic distance, the p{\displaystyle p}-adic absolute value of their difference. For this definition of distance, two numbers are close together (they have a small distance) when their difference is divisible by a high power of p{\displaystyle p}. In the same way that the real numbers can be formed from the rational numbers and their distances, by adding extra limiting values to form a complete field, the rational numbers with the p{\displaystyle p}-adic distance can be extended to a different complete field, the p{\displaystyle p}-adic numbers.[104][105]

In this test, the ±1{\displaystyle \pm 1} term is negative if a{\displaystyle a} is a square modulo the given (supposed) prime p{\displaystyle p}, and positive otherwise.

Some checksum methods are based on the mathematics of prime numbers. For instance the checksums used in International Standard Book Numbers are defined by taking the rest of the number modulo 11, a prime number. Because 11 is prime this method can detect both single-digit errors and transpositions of adjacent digits.[158] Another checksum method, Adler-32, uses arithmetic modulo 65521, the largest prime number less than 216{\displaystyle 2^{16}}.[159]Prime numbers are also used in pseudorandom number generators including linear congruential generators[160] and the Mersenne Twister.[161]

An arithmetic progression is a finite or infinite sequence of numbers such that consecutive numbers in the sequence all have the same difference.[81] This difference is called the modulus of the progression.[82] For example,
Several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (2048-bit primes are common).[154] RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (that is, more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} than to calculate x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} (assumed coprime) if only the product xy{\displaystyle xy} is known.[32] The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation (computing abmodc{\displaystyle a^{b}{\bmod {c}}}), while the reverse operation (the discrete logarithm) is thought to be a hard problem.[155]

One of the most famous unsolved questions in mathematics, dating from 1859, and one of the Millennium Prize Problems, is the Riemann hypothesis, which asks where the zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s){\displaystyle \zeta (s)} are located.This function is an analytic function on the complex numbers. For complex numbers s{\displaystyle s} with real part greater than one it equals both an infinite sum over all integers, and an infinite product over the prime numbers,
Indeed, much of the analysis of elliptic curve primality proving is based on the assumption that the input to the algorithm has already passed a probabilistic test.[131]

Prime numbers are frequently used for hash tables. For instance the original method of Carter and Wegman for universal hashing was based on computing hash functions by choosing random linear functions modulo large prime numbers. Carter and Wegman generalized this method to k{\displaystyle k}-independent hashing by using higher-degree polynomials, again modulo large primes.[156] As well as in the hash function, prime numbers are used for the hash table size in quadratic probing based hash tables to ensure that the probe sequence covers the whole table.[157]
The central importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general stems from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.[44] This theorem states that every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes. More strongly,this product is unique in the sense that any two prime factorizations of the same number will have the same numbers of copies of the same primes,although their ordering may differ.[45]So, although there are many different ways of finding a factorization using an integer factorization algorithm, they all must produce the same result. Primes can thus be considered the "basic building blocks" of the natural numbers.[46]
The terms in the product are called prime factors. The same prime factor may occur more than once; this example has two copies of the prime factor 3.{\displaystyle 3.}When a prime occurs multiple times, exponentiation can be used to group together multiple copies of the same prime number: for example, in the second way of writing the product above, 32{\displaystyle 3^{2}} denotes the square or second power of 3.{\displaystyle 3.}

Euclid's proof[52] shows that every finite list of primes is incomplete. The key idea is to multiply together the primes in any given list and add 1.{\displaystyle 1.} If the list consists of the primes p1,p2,…,pn,{\displaystyle p_{1},p_{2},\ldots ,p_{n},} this gives the number

Prime numbers are of central importance to number theory but also have many applications to other areas within mathematics, including abstract algebra and elementary geometry. For example, it is possible to place prime numbers of points in a two-dimensional grid so that no three are in a line, or so that every triangle formed by three of the points has large area.[162] Another example is Eisenstein's criterion, a test for whether a polynomial is irreducible based on divisibility of its coefficients by a prime number and its square.[163]

This equality between a sum and a product, discovered by Euler, is called an Euler product.[89] The Euler product can be derived from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and shows the close connection between the zeta function and the prime numbers.[90]It leads to another proof that there are infinitely many primes: if there were only finitely many,then the sum-product equality would also be valid at s=1{\displaystyle s=1}, but the sum would diverge (it is the harmonic series 1+12+13+…{\displaystyle 1+{\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\tfrac {1}{3}}+\dots }) while the product would be finite, a contradiction.[91]

The following table lists some of these tests. Their running time is given in terms of n{\displaystyle n}, the number to be tested and, for probabilistic algorithms, the number k{\displaystyle k} of tests performed. Moreover, ε{\displaystyle \varepsilon } is an arbitrarily small positive number, and log is the logarithm to an unspecified base. The big O notation means that each time bound should be multiplied by a constant factor to convert it from dimensionless units to units of time; this factor depends on implementation details such as the type of computer used to run the algorithm, but not on the input parameters n{\displaystyle n} and k{\displaystyle k}.

The Prim is the primordial chaos that Gan (the spirit of the Dark Tower) originally rose from, spinning the universes from his navel. The six Beams also arose from the Prim. It has receded since the universe has progressed. During its recession many demons of the Prim became stranded on the shores of all the parallel worlds, choking on the air; however, some adapted and survived. Most of these were sexual predators such as Succubi, Incubi and Oracles. Mia and Maerlyn are also entities of the Prim who adapted and survived.
It is noted by the Crimson King that Arthur Eld once mated with one from the Prim, the Crimson Queen, and that he is their son. However he also calls those of the Prim the Great Old Ones meaning the name may be interchangeable with the Old Ones of the Imperium.

The Old Ones once tried to destroy the Dark Tower by releasing the Prim themselves. This resulted in the forming of large cracks in the ground, which then became filled with monstrosities.

The Prim also goes by the name of "The Over" by the Manni.
The Crimson King wishes to bring about the destruction of all the worlds and free the people of the Prim once more, ruling eternally over it.
