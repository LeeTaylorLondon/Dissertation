Lewis MacLeod as Nathan, a Scottish-accented sperm whale with red eyes
William Salyers as Darcy, an emperor penguin that is the commander of the Ark-3, main antagonist
After passing several landmarks, the friends get to the Titanic, where they find the vampire squidNorma. She makes them listen to her musical performance, and tells them that in order to find Nathan, they need to get to Broadway. The heroes leave the ship with difficulty, since Norma would not let them go.
In a post-apocalyptic future the planet was subjected to an ecological catastrophe, and as a result the Earth was flooded. At the same time, sea inhabitants also suffered a catastrophe. The Kraken managed to save several inhabitants and formed a safe place to live with them, which is a colony located in the deep sea of the Atlantic Ocean.

Returning home, the characters, along with Nathan, begin to free Kraken and the others, and Deep nearly sacrifices his life to completely free himself of the debris. After liberation, Maura offers an idea where it will be possible to start fertilizing and increase the population, while Deep finds love. Darcy, Ralph and Luigi are stranded on a floating ice floe in the Arctic Ocean near Greenland crying out for help.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 6 critics.[2]
Bob Bergen as Ralph, a bottlenose dolphin with low intelligence, one of Darcy's minions
Deep is a 2017 English-language Spanish-Belgian-Swiss computer-animated science fiction adventure film directed by Julio Soto Gurpide. Inspiration for the film came from Julio's deep sea diving experiences.[1]
Anna Vocino as Norma, a purple vampire squid named after Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard
Phil LaMarr as Artie a crayfish who serves as a advisor for Kraken.
Having reached the Brooklyn Bridge, the friends find themselves surrounded by crabs, where their leader, the yeti crab Rico, challenges them to a dance battle. Alice's performance strikes Rico, and he falls in love with her. After that, the heroes pass the Brooklyn Bridge onto the streets of flooded New York City. They enter the radiation zone and overcome a number of zombie piranhas.
When the heroes are placed in a trap, they finally met Nathan, who is chained, and immediately learn of Darcy's plan to freeze everyone, including Maura, who had not fallen into the trap. Deep, Alice and Evo manage to disable the cell without letting it freeze, and then get out of the locked cell and join Maura in battle against Darcy, Luigi and Ralph. As a result, they triumph over the trio and are ejected from the in-motion "Ark-3" along with Nathan and the other sea creatures.
Along the way, Deep is attacked by the Moray eel Maura, but immediately after hearing from him that he has friends, she admits that she is lonely. Deep adds Maura to the team, despite the fact that Alice and Evo are against taking a predator that almost ate them on the first night.
Dwight Schultz as Kraken, an elderly colossal squid, Deep's grandpa
The characters have a disagreement when it becomes apparent they are lost, and everyone accuses Deep of taking them on a dangerous journey. They meet the penguin Darcy and his assistants: the walrus Luigi and the dolphin Ralph. While Darcy and Luigi distract the main characters by watching the film about the project "Ark-1" and "Ark-2" (which are spacecraft that saved humans and ground animals respectively, by leaving the Earth and settling another planet), they discuss the plan to freeze them and leave the Earth on the "Ark-3" (which is for aquatic animals).

Kraken's grandson, Deep, considers life to be boring, but shows an interest in objects made by humans. He also involves his friends: anglerfish Evo and shrimp Alice. Soon one of Deep's "pranks" accidentally endangers the inhabitants of his home and encloses them by stones. Deep learns from Kraken that only the white whale Nathan can help them, and tells his grandson the necessary landmarks to identify where Nathan can be found. Deep, Evo and Alice set out to find Nathan.

Many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called long short-term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997.[55] LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn "Very Deep Learning" tasks[12] that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before, which is important for speech. In 2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.[56] Later it was combined with connectionist temporal classification (CTC)[57] in stacks of LSTM RNNs.[58] In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which they made available through Google Voice Search.[59]

A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism.[192][193] Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks, may be closer to biological reality.[194][195] In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.[196]

A large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval. These failures are caused by insufficient efficacy (on-target effect), undesired interactions (off-target effects), or unanticipated toxic effects.[156][157] Research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets,[85][86] off-targets, and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs.[87][88][89]

As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing "Go"[97] ).

The first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons was published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1967.[26] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by the group method of data handling.[27] Other deep learning working architectures, specifically those built for computer vision, began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980.[28]
Closely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks. DNNs have proven themselves capable, for example, of

Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition. The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation.[52] The SRI deep neural network was then deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning.[53]

Most Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated by humans.[224] It has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-paid clickwork (e.g. on Amazon Mechanical Turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose, but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such.[225] The philosopher Rainer Mühlhoff distinguishes five types of "machinic capture" of human microwork to generate training data: (1) gamification (the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game), (2) "trapping and tracking" (e.g. CAPTCHAs for image recognition or click-tracking on Google search results pages), (3) exploitation of social motivations (e.g. tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images), (4) information mining (e.g. by leveraging quantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and (5) clickwork.[225]

Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights for CMAC. The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.[116][117]

The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al.[20] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function; If the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.

The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions.[16][17][18][19] In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions[16] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik.[17] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as the rectified linear unit.[23]

ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry. ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.[222]

The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English, where each speaker reads 10 sentences.[128] Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone-sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.

Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.[118] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[119] OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[120][121]
Image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.[93][94][95]

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.
In 2017 graph neural networks were used for the first time to predict various properties of molecules in a large toxicology data set.[162] In 2019, generative neural networks were used to produce molecules that were validated experimentally all the way into mice.[163][164]

For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer,[citation needed] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name "deep" networks.

The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.
Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs have been explored for many years.[46][47][48] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively.[49] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing[43] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models.[50][51] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power.

As deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception.[220] By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Such manipulation is termed an “adversarial attack.”[221]

Significant additional impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades, and GPU implementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, fast implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision.[79][81][36][90][12] In 2011, this approach achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest. Also in 2011, it won the ICDAR Chinese handwriting contest, and in May 2012, it won the ISBI image segmentation contest.[91] Until 2011, CNNs did not play a major role at computer vision conferences, but in June 2012, a paper by Ciresan et al. at the leading conference CVPR[3] showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records. In October 2012, a similar system by Krizhevsky et al.[4] won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. In November 2012, Ciresan et al.'s system also won the ICPR contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection, and in the following year also the MICCAI Grand Challenge on the same topic.[92] In 2013 and 2014, the error rate on the ImageNet task using deep learning was further reduced, following a similar trend in large-scale speech recognition.
In 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed with Peter Dayan and Hinton.[42] Many factors contribute to the slow speed, including the vanishing gradient problem analyzed in 1991 by Sepp Hochreiter.[43][44]

A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.[9][12] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.[98] These components as a whole function similarly to a human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.[citation needed]

As of 2008,[207] researchers at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) developed a machine learning framework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement, or TAMER, which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor.[181] First developed as TAMER, a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration between U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and UT researchers. Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot the ability to learn new tasks through observation.[181] Using Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in-person. The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer, who provided feedback such as “good job” and “bad job.”[208]

The probabilistic interpretation[22] derives from the field of machine learning. It features inference,[8][9][10][12][15][22] as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function.[22] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop.[24]

Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s.[187][188][189][190] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, "...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature."[191]
Google's DeepMind Technologies developed a system capable of learning how to play Atari video games using only pixels as data input. In 2015 they demonstrated their AlphaGo system, which learned the game of Go well enough to beat a professional Go player.[203][204][205] Google Translate uses a neural network to translate between more than 100 languages.
Some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors,[214] such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images (2014)[215] and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images (2013).[216] Goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component artificial general intelligence (AGI) architectures.[214] These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar[217] decompositions of observed entities and events.[214] Learning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition[218] and artificial intelligence (AI).[219]

DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate, and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples)[113] speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.[114][115]

Mühlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning such as Facebook's face recognition system, the need for training data does not stop once an ANN is trained. Rather, there is a continued demand for human-generated verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ANN. For this purpose Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image, they receive a notification. They can choose whether of not they like to be publicly labeled on the image, or tell Facebook that it is not them in the picture.[226] This user interface is a mechanism to generate "a constant stream of verification data"[225] to further train the network in real-time. As Mühlhoff argues, involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning that such systems may be referred to as "human-aided artificial intelligence".[225]
A main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods.[209] Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent. However, the theory surrounding other algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear.[citation needed] (e.g., Does it converge? If so, how fast? What is it approximating?) Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box, with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.[210]

Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks.[10][15]
The principle of elevating "raw" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the "raw" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s,[53] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.[54]

Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved.[64][65] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were superseded for ASR by CTC[57] for LSTM.[55][59][66][67][68] but are more successful in computer vision.
Advances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning. In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning, “as deep-learning neural networks were trained with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).”[77] That year, Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times.[78] In particular, GPUs are well-suited for the matrix/vector computations involved in machine learning.[79][80][81] GPUs speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude, reducing running times from weeks to days.[82][83] Further, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models.[84]

Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement.[172][173] Modern deep learning tools demonstrate the high accuracy of detecting various diseases and the helpfulness of their use by specialists to improve the diagnosis efficiency.[174][175]
In March 2019, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing.

Independently in 1988, Wei Zhang et al. applied the backpropagation algorithm to a convolutional neural network (a simplified Neocognitron by keeping only the convolutional interconnections between the image feature layers and the last fully connected layer) for alphabets recognition and also proposed an implementation of the CNN with an optical computing system.[37][38] Subsequently, Wei Zhang, et al. modified the model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in 1991[39] and breast cancer detection in mammograms in 1994.[40]
Other key techniques in this field are negative sampling[141] and word embedding. Word embedding, such as word2vec, can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space. Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar. A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN.[142] Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing.[142] Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing,[143] sentiment analysis,[144] information retrieval,[145][146] spoken language understanding,[147] machine translation,[103][148] contextual entity linking,[148] writing style recognition,[149] Text classification and others.[150]

The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.

Finding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many data points must be considered and analyzed before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server.[176] Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets. Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle. This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection.
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that[8]: 199–200  uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.

The word "deep" in "deep learning" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.[12] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.[13] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.

Google Translate (GT) uses a large end-to-end long short-term memory (LSTM) network.[151][152][153][154] Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) uses an example-based machine translation method in which the system "learns from millions of examples."[152] It translates "whole sentences at a time, rather than pieces. Google Translate supports over one hundred languages.[152] The network encodes the "semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations".[152][155] GT uses English as an intermediate between most language pairs.[155]

"Keynote talk: 'Achievements and Challenges of Deep Learning - From Speech Analysis and Recognition To Language and Multimodal Processing'"
In 1994, André de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained. Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.[41]

DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives.[99] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.[9] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.[100]

DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or "weights", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights.[101] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.

Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning. LSTM RNNs can learn "Very Deep Learning" tasks[12] that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates[107] is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.[56]

Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons[197] and neural populations.[198] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system[199] both at the single-unit[200] and at the population[201] levels.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming.

Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner.[182] One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods relies on.[183][184]

"Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines. Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (...) have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used. The most powerful A.I. systems, like Watson (...) use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning."[211]
As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting and computation time.

In 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing.[127] The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs, and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds.[127] Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications.[127]

The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets (DNN) might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.[64] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different,[70] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems.[8][71][72] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition,[70] eventually leading to pervasive and dominant use in that industry. That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.[64][70][73]

Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural network's (ANN) computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.

DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning[27] or weight decay (ℓ2{\displaystyle \ell _{2}}-regularization) or sparsity (ℓ1{\displaystyle \ell _{1}}-regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting.[110] Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. This helps to exclude rare dependencies.[111] Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting.[112]

Arronax: The Nektons submarine. Described as the "world's largest submarine", it serves as the Nektons home and has a library, medical bay, and laboratory, kitchen, several bedrooms, a moon pool, and various other facilities. It has a system of tubes and cavities connected to fish tanks in several rooms, which Jeffery can use to travel around the submarine. It has a "water-powered" engine,[14] and batteries,[15] as well as a traditional screw propeller for forward propulsion,[16] giving it a top speed of 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph).[17] Its hull is made from titanium, allowing it to withstand high temperatures[18] and highly corrosive environments.[19]

The Guardians: A group of people who work to preserve Lemurian culture and are extremely knowledgeable about anything to do with Lemuria but are usually reluctant to divulge too much. They are quite well equipped, having access to helicopters as seen in "The Proteus Factor", but prefer to travel by rowboat (or other small, open boats) over the ocean and are often encountered alone in one. They can communicate via special staffs, which can also be used to block other communications signals. They wear a characteristic dark grey robe with gold-coloured edging and were established by Nereus after the fall of Lemuria.
Devil Daniels (voiced by Trevor Devall): an internet-famous "monster hunter" and vlogger. His adventures often clash with the Nekton's activities or have to be hindered by them to avoid harm to the targets of his hunts. As well as putting on a fake British accent, Daniels often fakes his adventures and has no consideration for animal welfare. He is cowardly and will do anything to gain and retain viewers besides placing himself in any real danger.

Mystical Energy Cube is a mystical energy cube from series 2 episode 2 (Sb,Eb). Ant finds it in the Baltic Sea anomaly. It awakens a cloud of creatures which attack the aronax, and are only called away by Ants cube, which is a power source. At the end of the episode, Ant throws the mystical cube into the Sea anomaly to tempt the creatures away from the aronax. This is potentially Lemurian, but Ant passionately argues for Aleins
Professor Fiction (voiced by James Higuchi): The Nekton's scientific adviser, as well as the builder of the Arronax and the Knights. His inventions usually require tweaking and testing but are extremely effective when working correctly.
Nereus (voiced by Lee Tockar): an eccentric old bearded man who gives the Nektons vague (but often unexpectedly useful) advice on their search for Lemuria. He is mysterious and often gives the Nektons advice in riddles. He sometimes arrives or appears unexpectedly, which initially unnerves the Nektons. In "Lemuria", it turns out he is about 6000 years old and the brother of the last Queen of Lemuria.
Fontaine Nekton (voiced by Ashleigh Ball from "Here Be Dragons"-"The Maze", and Shannon Chan-Kent starting with "Finn Comes Aboard" and "The Missing") is Ant's older sister. She enjoys winding Ant up in various ways but always looks out for him. Smiling Finn has a crush on her.

Dragon 2 may be related to the dragon in Series 1 Episode 1 (s:a/e:a) (who the Nektons stole the chronicle of the deep from). It was probably employed by Nereus to protect Raja Chulan’s glass case from humans. However, the dragon then discovers the Nektons, Nereus, and (Dr) Jennifer Chan, trying to take the case. Unlike his relation, he successfully guards the case. And after a few reckless moments from (Dr) Jennifer Chan, they leave the dragon with the case.

Raja Chulan made a deal with The Guardians lead by Nereus, 800 years ago, so they built him (Raja Chulan) a glass case, with a (quote) “hook that could allow it to be lowered by a barge”.The Guardians built the case because they wanted to re-find Lemuria. Raja Chulan married a princess of the underwater realm calledMahtabu El Bahri. Together they had three children, the youngest of which was called Sang Nila Ultama he founded Singapura, which is the old name for Singapore. Meanwhile, the glass case was abandoned in a cave, and the guardians employed a dragon to protect it. 100 years later a rockfall sealed the cave in. 680 years after that,Dr Chan, growing up, heard of Raja Chulan’s legend. She searched for his glass case for 10 years, her assistant became Nereus, after his memory of Raja Chulan was jogged back to his mind. Fontaine videoed the entire experience, and (Dr) Jennifer Chan was back a few episodes later.

The Chronicle of the Deep: A kind of scroll that contains information about the Lemurian culture and associated artifacts and locations. It was hidden in a cave within an ocean trench that opens once every 40 years and is guarded by a giant plesiosaur-like sea monster until retrieved by the Nektons in "Here Be Dragons".There are several different ways to open it, each of which reveals a different part of the Chronicle.

It first appears in "The Gates", and it tries to escape any time the gates of Lemuria are opened whilst also trying to destroy anyone and anything around the entrance.

the Project manager from the deep sea mining corporationcould be argued as good or bad. In his episode, the Nektons (and professor Fiction) find a deep sea minor about to destroy some rare ‘bloop’ coral.

The Monumential Turtle is a gigantic turtle, initially mistaken for the island of Tartaruga, until it awakens and dives below the surface. It later appears in "The Purple Tide", where it nearly eats the Arronax by mistake; however, the turtle is one of the more benevolent monumentials, as opposed to their usually quite hostile nature.

'Mad' Madeline Hammerhead (voiced by Kazumi Evans): Daughter of Captain Hammerhead and her father's pride and joy. She loves everything related to being a pirate and outwardly detests Ant and the Nektons, though is very jealous of their equipment.
Agnus is a palaeontologist, and is saved by the Nektons after she, and Will, fell down a sinkhole. She is nice at the start of her single episode, but seems to flip at one point, after her dinosaur bones are only found out as 60 years old-ish. But at the end, she is happy and seems not as bad.

Sang Nila Ultama was the youngest of Raja Chulan and Mahtabu el Bahri they Founded Singapura, which is the old name for Singapore.
In season three, the Nektons discover Lemuria, and the main story becomes irrelevant. In season four, the family seek out William Nektons Parents, who found Lemuria several months before them. Like previous seasons, not all episodes are part of this arc. Williams parents are found eaten by a monumental nautilus (very much alive), the nautilus is searching for a key to the sea, which keeps everything in balance.
Danny Boy (voiced by Brian Drummond): First Mate of the Dark Orca pirate crew. Easily intimidated by Captain Hammerhead. He is a mechanic but struggles with poor equipment and a lack of materials on the Dark Orca, and his repairs and inventions usually break quickly.
Adele Flemming is the communicator for an internet company supplying most of England. Her company almost kills Ant, But indirectly, as her company sends a EMP through a cable, that ant is nearby. She tricks the Nektons, and she never owns up, instead trying to cover it up, a vocal slip up causes her plan to be foiled. Her company was charged by Kaiko, and it may be presumed that she was fired soon after, from costing the company a six digit number. (However, this was never proved) At the end of the episode, she apologises. To sum up her appearance, she is deceiving, irresponsible and tries to weasel out of much. However, unlike the pirates, or Alpheus, she was not super evil, for revenge or any suchlike. She is very similar to
Raja Chulan a myth (age: about 800 years), in the chronicle of the deep. He wanted to explore the underwater, and the guardians wanted to find Lemuria, so they built him a glass case which could be lowered from a barge. He married an underwater princess and discovered the long lost city of Dika.

(Dr) Jennifer Chan is in two episodes, and has a very optimistic personality. She went to college with Kaiko for six months. For ten years she has been chasing the legend of Raja Chulan. She is generally good natured but (quote) “my drive blinded me” says Dr Chan as her ending quote in her Main feature episode. She was desperate for the Glass case, and despite the Nektons disagreement, she try’s to buy time and take the case with them. A dragon stops her.
