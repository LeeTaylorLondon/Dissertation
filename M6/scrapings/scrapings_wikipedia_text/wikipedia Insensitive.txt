Anne Loree would recall writing "Insensitive" in response to an unhappy tryst with a chef at a Calgary restaurant where Loree was waiting tables. "I sat down at my electric piano in the basement of a rented house I shared with four roommates, broke and brokenhearted, full of pain and angst, and wrote 'Insensitive'. It took me probably less than half an hour and I walked away feeling much better for it and much hipper to Prince Charmings who aren't really into you."[1] Jann Arden, then based in Calgary, optioned "Insensitive" for Living Under June after hearing Loree perform the song at a local club.[2]

The popular podcast "How to Do Everything" created by the producers of the NPR news quiz "Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!" featured the song in a series of podcasts. The song was introduced by a music expert when asked if there was a song she loved, but understood was terrible. This began a segment on the podcast titled "Best-Worst Song Competition" where listeners submitted songs they secretly enjoyed, but knew were generally considered to be poor songs. Each segment opened with a clip of "Insensitive" with the hosts saying "You know what that sound means – it's time for our Best-Worst Song Competition!"[29]

"Insensitive" remains by far Arden's most successful single to date. It reached number one in her native Canada for three weeks,[3] number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100,[4] and number four on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart.[5] The song's US success was assisted by its presence in the film Bed of Roses; although Bed of Roses was not a major success, the video for "Insensitive" was aired on an episode of Entertainment Tonight, on which the film had been promoted.[citation needed] Its Italian success was occasioned by its use as a jingle in a TV ad campaign for department store Coin.[2] On August 20, 1995, "Insensitive" reached number one on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart for one week,[6] and it also charted in New Zealand at number 44 and in the United Kingdom at number 40.[7][8] At the Juno Awards of 1996 "Insensitive" was named Single of the Year.[citation needed]
