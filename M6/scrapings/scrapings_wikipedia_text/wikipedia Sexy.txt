In 2005, Tkautz relaunched her music career with the album Lost and Found, which included two new versions of "Sexy (Is The Word)". These were contemporary remixes where new vocals were recorded, and whilst not released as a single, the song received much attention in nightclubs around Australia. There was a film clip released with this track to clubs which was a re-edited version of the original music video.
The music video for his single features Melissa in a number of guises. She is seen in hot pink lingerie and in a leather Jacket, cavorting with a large block of ice.

.sexy, along with .tattoo, was one of the first two gTLDs launched by Uniregistry on 14 November 2013.[2] Its sunrise period, during which pre-existing trademark holders may register URLs prior to general availability to prevent domain squatting, lasted from 11 December 2013 to 9 February 2014, and it entered general availability on 25 February 2014.[3] .sexy was one of the first hundred gTLDs to be delegated.[4] Prior to its release, .sexy was one of many announced gTLDs, variously reported as 31[5] and over 160,[6] that the Communication and Information Technology Commission of the government of Saudi Arabia objected to; other TLDs found objectionable included .gay, .casino, .sucks, .wine, and .bible.[5][6]

You can put pretty much any profession or product name in front of a .guru and it is meaningful as a brand or a rather grandiose self-appointed title. Not so with .sexy. Ironically, this appears to be [Schilling's] "Toilet Paper Test" in action. Schilling argues that the test of how generic, and by extension popular, a gTLD is should be whether toiletpaper.[tld] works. I think toiletpaper.guru works, but toiletpaper.sexy does not.

On the first day of .sexy's general availability, around 2,000 domain names were registered, which commentators described as a "disappointing" low showing. The domain had a comparable number of first-day registrations as unpopular domains from Uniregistry's competitor Donuts such as .gallery and .estate.[7][8] .sexy's launch was hampered by a lack of support from and availability at major domain name registrars such as GoDaddy,[9] based in privacy concerns around Uniregistry's demands that registrants inform Uniregistry of their real names and identities to purchase domains.[10] A number of pre-orders of .sexy domains were also stymied by domain name collision, the phenomenon where a private (intranet) domain name system queries a public one,[11] and by names that had been pre-ordered being reserved by Uniregistry.[12]

In 2015, a survey by ICANN concluded networks in Iran were systematically blocking .sexy domains.[13] In 2017, Uniregistry CEO Frank Schilling increased the price of .sexy and a number of other domains due to low uptake. Schilling stated that the costs of running a TLD demanded that low-use TLDs, such as .sexy, be sold at higher price points in order to turn a profit.[14]

There is an even more general meaning: "Exciting", or simply "attractive" in the most general sense. For example, people preparing to do a PhD might talk about a "sexy new area of research" the want to be involved in; Employers will entice interviewees with the chance to play with "sexy new toys" - i.e. technologies and equipment that the prospective employeer would be unable to get their hands on elsewhere.It's hard to think where to find citations for these uses, since they're more likely to occur in face-to-face speech than any official or published documents, but you should be able find examples in fictional dialogue, either prose or TV/movie.82.33.116.25 (talk) 03:10, 4 April 2012 (UTC)Reply[reply]
