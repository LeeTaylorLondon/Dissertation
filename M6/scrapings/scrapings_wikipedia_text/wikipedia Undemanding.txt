Although Arago's experimental result was overwhelming evidence in favor of the wave theory, a century later, in conjunction with the birth of quantum mechanics (and first suggested in one of Albert Einstein's Annus Mirabilis papers), it became understood that light (as well as all forms of matter and energy) must be described as both a particle and a wave (wave–particle duality). However the particle associated with electromagnetic waves, the photon, has nothing in common with the particles imagined in the corpuscular theory that had been dominant before the rise of the wave theory and Arago's powerful demonstration. Unlike attempts of the corpuscular theory to explain the propagation of light, the properties of photons have no role in explaining phenomena such as diffraction and interference; these are examples of light propagation strictly dependent on its wave character.

The red lines in these three graphs correspond to the simulated images above, and the green lines were computed by applying the corresponding parameters to the squared Bessel function given above.
This integral can be solved numerically[dubious– discuss] (see below). If g is large and b is small so that the angle χ{\displaystyle \chi } is not negligible[dubious– discuss] one can write the integral for the on-axis case (P1 is at the center of the shadow) as (see [18]):

At the heart of Fresnel's wave theory is the Huygens–Fresnel principle, which states that every unobstructed point of a wavefront becomes the source of a secondary spherical wavelet and that the amplitude of the optical field E at a point on the screen is given by the superposition of all those secondary wavelets taking into account their relative phases.[16] This means that the field at a point P1 on the screen is given by a surface integral:

So for each angle one has to compute the intersection point(s) of the ray with the circular object and then sum the contributions I(θ1){\displaystyle I(\theta _{1})} for a certain number of angles between 0 and 2π{\displaystyle 2\pi }. Results of such a calculation are shown in the following images.
Poisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and, being a supporter of the particle theory of light, looked for a way to prove it wrong. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he argued that a consequence of Fresnel's theory was that there would exist an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle theory of light. This prediction was seen as an absurd consequence of the wave theory, and the failure of that prediction should be a strong argument to reject Fresnel's theory.

In 2009, the Arago spot experiment was demonstrated with a supersonic expansion beam of deuterium molecules (an example of neutral matter waves).[23] Material particles behaving like waves is known from quantum mechanics. The wave-nature of particles actually dates back to de Broglie's hypothesis[24] as well as Davisson and Germer's experiments.[25] An Arago spot of electrons, which also constitute matter waves, can be observed in transmission electron microscopes when examining circular structures of a certain size.

However, the head of the committee, Dominique-François-Jean Arago, decided to actually perform the experiment. He molded a 2 mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax.[12] He succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave nature of light and gave Fresnel the win.[13]
In optics, the Arago spot, Poisson spot,[1][2] or Fresnel spot[3] is a bright point that appears at the center of a circular object's shadow due to Fresnel diffraction.[4][5][6][7] This spot played an important role in the discovery of the wave nature of light and is a common way to demonstrate that light behaves as a wave (for example, in undergraduate physics laboratory exercises).

To calculate the full diffraction image that is visible on the screen one has to consider the surface integral of the previous section. One cannot exploit circular symmetry anymore, since the line between the source and an arbitrary point on the screen does not pass through the center of the circular object. With the aperture function g(r,θ){\displaystyle g(r,\theta )} which is 1 for transparent parts of the object plane and 0 otherwise (i.e. It is 0 if the direct line between source and the point on the screen passes through the blocking circular object.) the integral that needs to be solved is given by:

The images are simulations of the Arago spot in the shadow of discs of diameter 4 mm, 2 mm, and 1 mm, imaged 1 m behind each disc. The disks are illuminated by light of wavelength of 633 nm, diverging from a point 1 m in front of each disc. Each image is 16 mm wide.
Beside the demonstration of wave-behavior, the Arago spot also has a few other applications. One of the ideas is to use the Arago spot as a straight line reference in alignment systems.[26] Another is to probe aberrations in laser beams by using the spot's sensitivity to beam aberrations.[20]Finally, the aragoscope has been proposed as a method for dramatically improving the diffraction-limited resolution of space-based telescopes.[27][28]
In order to derive the intensity behind the circular obstacle using this integral one assumes that the experimental parameters fulfill the requirements of the near-field diffraction regime (the size of the circular obstacle is large compared to the wavelength and small compared to the distances g = P0C and b = CP1). Going to polar coordinates[dubious– discuss] then yields the integral for a circular object of radius a (see for example Born and Wolf[17]):
The Arago spot is very sensitive to small-scale deviations from the ideal circular cross-section. This means that a small amount of surface roughness of the circular object can completely cancel out the bright spot. This is shown in the following three diagrams which are simulations of the Arago spot from a 4 mm diameter disc (g = b = 1 m):
For an ideal point source, the intensity of the Arago spot equals that of the undisturbed wave front. Only the width of the Arago spot intensity peak depends on the distances between source, circular object and screen, as well as the source's wavelength and the diameter of the circular object.This means that one can compensate for a reduction in the source's wavelength by increasing the distance l between circular object and screen or reducing the circular object's diameter.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the idea that light does not simply propagate along straight lines gained traction. Thomas Young published his double-slit experiment in 1807.[9] The original Arago spot experiment was carried out a decade later and was the deciding experiment on the question of whether light is a particle or a wave. It is thus an example of an experimentum crucis.
The source intensity, which is the square of the field amplitude, is I0=|1gAeikg|2{\textstyle I_{0}=\left|{\frac {1}{g}}Ae^{\mathbf {i} kg}\right|^{2}} and the intensity at the screen I=|U(P1)|2{\displaystyle I=\left|U(P_{1})\right|^{2}}. The on-axis intensity as a function of the distance b is hence given by:

Finally, the edge of the circular object must be sufficiently smooth.

This shows that the on-axis intensity at distances b much greater than the diameter of the circular obstacle is the same as the source intensity, as if the circular object was not present at all. However at larger distances b, it turns out that the size of the bright spot (as can be seen in the simulations below where b/a is increased in successive images) is larger therefore making the spot easier to discern.
The simulation includes a regular sinusoidal corrugation of the circular shape of amplitude 10 μm, 50 μm and 100 μm, respectively. Note, that the 100 μm edge corrugation almost completely removes the central bright spot.

This effect can be best understood using the Fresnel zone concept. The field transmitted by a radial segment that stems from a point on the obstacle edge provides a contribution whose phase is tight to the position of the edge point relative to Fresnel zones. If the variance in the radius of the obstacle are much smaller than the width of Fresnel zone near the edge, the contributions form radial segments are approximately in phase and interfere constructively. However, if random edge corrugation have amplitude comparable to or greater than the width of that adjacent Fresnel zone, the contributions from radial segments are no longer in phase and cancel each other reducing the Arago spot intensity.

When light shines on the circular obstacle, Huygens' principle says that every point in the plane of the obstacle acts as a new point source of light. The light coming from points on the circumference of the obstacle and going to the center of the shadow travels exactly the same distance, so all the light passing close by the object arrives at the screen in phase and constructively interferes. This results in a bright spot at the shadow's center, where geometrical optics and particle theories of light predict that there should be no light at all.

In astronomy, the Arago spot can also be observed in the strongly defocussed image of a star in a Newtonian telescope. There, the star provides an almost ideal point source at infinity, and the secondary mirror of the telescope constitutes the circular obstacle.
At that time, many favored Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory of light, among them the theoretician Siméon Denis Poisson.[10] In 1818 the French Academy of Sciences launched a competition to explain the properties of light, where Poisson was one of the members of the judging committee. The civil engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel entered this competition by submitting a new wave theory of light.[11]

The main reason why the Arago spot is hard to observe in circular shadows from conventional light sources is that such light sources are bad approximations of point sources. If the wave source has a finite size S then the Arago spot will have an extent that is given by Sb/g, as if the circular object acted like a lens.[16] At the same time the intensity of the Arago spot is reduced with respect to the intensity of the undisturbed wave front. Defining the relative intensity Irel{\displaystyle I_{\text{rel}}}as the intensity divided by the intensity of the undisturbed wavefront, the relative intensity for an extended circular source of diameter w can be expressed exactly using the following equation:[21]

However, it is possible to solve the radial part of the integral so that only the integration over the azimuth angle remains to be done numerically.[19] For a particular angle one must solve the line integral for the ray with origin at the intersection point of the line P0P1 with the circular object plane. The contribution for a particular ray with azimuth angle θ1{\displaystyle \theta _{1}} and passing a transparent part of the object plane from r=s{\displaystyle r=s} to r=t{\displaystyle r=t} is:
The edge corrugation should not be much more than 10% of this width to see a close to ideal Arago spot. In the above simulations with the 4 mm diameter disc the adjacent Fresnel zone has a width of about 77 μm.
If the cross-section of the circular object deviates slightly from its circular shape (but it still has a sharp edge on a smaller scale) the shape of the point-source Arago spot changes. In particular, if the object has an ellipsoidal cross-section the Arago spot has the shape of an evolute.[22] Note that this is only the case if the source is close to an ideal point source. From an extended source the Arago spot is only affected marginally, since one can interpret the Arago spot as a point-spread function. Therefore, the image of the extended source only becomes washed out due to the convolution with the point-spread function, but it does not decrease in over all intensity.

ℓ is the distance between the object and the screen, and
Arago later noted[citation needed] that the phenomenon (later known as "Poisson's spot" or the "spot of Arago") had already been observed[dubious– discuss] by Delisle[14] and Maraldi[15] a century earlier.
These conditions together explain why the bright spot is not encountered in everyday life. However, with the laser sources available today, it is undemanding to perform an Arago-spot experiment.[8]

In psychology, a facet is a specific and unique aspect of a broader personality trait.[1] Both the concept and the term "facet" were introduced by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae in the first edition of the NEO-Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) Manual.[1][2] Facets were originally elaborated only for the neuroticism, openness to experience, and extraversion traits; Costa and McCrae introduced facet scales for the agreeableness and conscientiousness traits in the Revised NEO-PI (NEO PI-R).[3] Each of the Big Five personality traits in the five factor model contains six facets, each of which is measured with a separate scale.[4] The use of facets and facet scales has since expanded beyond the NEO PI-R, with alternative facet and domain structures derived from other models of personality. Examples include the HEXACO model of personality structure,[5][6] psycholexical studies,[7] circumplex models (e.g., Goldberg's Abridged Big-Five Dimensional Circumplex),[8] the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ),[9] and the California Psychological Inventory.[10]
The standard five factor model conceives of personality as a collection of unidimensional, polar scales. In contrast, circumplex models explore personality as it is constructed in the two-dimensional space created by the intersections of these polar scales.[8] Timothy Leary was the first to apply the circumplex to the study of personality.[12] Following Leary's pioneering work in the 1950s, Jerry Wiggins' Interpersonal Circle was one of the most influential early circumplex models of personality.[8][13] Despite similarities between the Interpersonal Circle and two of the Big Five,[8] it was only later that the work of Lewis Goldberg with Dean Peabody,[14] and Willem Hofstee and Boele de Raad[8] integrated the circumplex and Five Factor models. The result was The Abridged Big-Five Dimensional Circumplex (AB5C). In place of specific facet labels, Goldberg and his colleagues use Roman numerals, and plus and minus signs corresponding to the two intersecting factors. For example, the facet corresponding to the intersection of extraversion and disagreeableness is represented by "I+II−".
"Hierarchical subcomponents of the Big Five personality factors: A cross-language replication"
In contrast with Costa and McCrae's admittedly arbitrary decisions, studies guided by the Lexical hypothesis root facets in the personality language of laypeople. This approach is meant to test, and possibly enhance, the content validity of the measures used.[7] Using the Five Factor Model, Gerard Saucier and Fritz Ostendorf explored each domain's facet structure through lexical studies. Using English and German participants and materials, they found a total of 18 facets, or "subcomponents," of the Big Five.[7][11] These are:

The HEXACO Model is a six-factor model of personality. This model was developed in the early 2000s by Michael C. Ashton and Kibeom Lee using lexical studies.[19] The HEXACO Model adds a sixth factor, Honesty-Humility, to five factors similar to those in the Big Five: Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience. Despite these similarities, the facet structures of traits in the HEXACO Model differ from those in the Five Factor Model.[20] In addition to these trait-specific facets, Ashton and Lee have proposed two "interstitial" facets located in the space between traits. The first, Altruism (versus Antagonism), is shared by Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, and Emotionality. The second, Negative Self-Evaluation, is shared by Extraversion and Emotionality.[21] The following table displays the trait and facet labels used by Ashton and Lee.[22]

Costa and McCrae originally developed facet scales for neuroticism, extraversion, and openness to experience to reflect the fact that each broader trait is composed of different aspects of personality.[1] They admit their decisions were somewhat arbitrary and acknowledge that each trait may actually have more or less than six facets. However, they justify their choices with the need for a balance between comprehension and comprehensiveness and research supporting their six facet breakdown of each Big Five personality trait.[1][4] The following table displays the labels used by Costa and McCrae for each personality domain and its constituent facets.[3]
