Toughness can be determined by integrating the stress-strain curve.[1] It is the energy of mechanical deformation per unit volume prior to fracture. The explicit mathematical description is:[3]
The toughness of a material can be measured using a small specimen of that material. A typical testing machine uses a pendulum to deform a notched specimen of defined cross-section. The height from which the pendulum fell, minus the height to which it rose after deforming the specimen, multiplied by the weight of the pendulum, is a measure of the energy absorbed by the specimen as it was deformed during the impact with the pendulum. The Charpy and Izod notched impact strength tests are typical ASTM tests used to determine toughness.
Tensile toughness (or, deformation energy, UT) is measured in units of joule per cubic metre (J·m−3) in the SI system and inch-pound-force per cubic inch (in·lbf·in−3) in US customary units.1.00 N·m.m−3 ≃ 0.000145 in·lbf·in−3 and 1.00 in·lbf·in−3 ≃ 6.89 kN·m.m−3.
In materials science and metallurgy, toughness is the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing.[1] Toughness is the strength with which the material opposes rupture. One definition of material toughness is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before rupturing. This measure of toughness is different from that used for fracture toughness, which describes load bearing capabilities of materials with flaws.[2] It is also defined as a material's resistance to fracture when stressed.

If the upper limit of integration up to the yield point is restricted, the energy absorbed per unit volume is known as the modulus of resilience. Mathematically, the modulus of resilience can be expressed by the product of the square of the yield stress divided by two times the Young's modulus of elasticity. That is,

Toughness is related to the area under the stress–strain curve. In order to be tough, a material must be both strong and ductile. For example, brittle materials (like ceramics) that are strong but with limited ductility are not tough; conversely, very ductile materials with low strengths are also not tough. To be tough, a material should withstand both high stresses and high strains. Generally speaking, strength indicates how much force the material can support, while toughness indicates how much energy a material can absorb before rupturing.
In the SI system, the unit of tensile toughness can be easily calculated by using area underneath the stress–strain (σ–ε) curve, which gives tensile toughness value, as given below:[4]

Another definition is the ability to absorb mechanical energy up to the point of failure. The area under the stress-strain curve is called toughness.

The term has been appropriated to justify authoritarian parenting[7] and boot camps for teenagers which Maia Szalavitz characterizes as abusive.[8] The National Institutes of Health noted that "get tough treatments do not work and there is some evidence that they may make the problem worse".[9] Szalavitz believes tough love rhetoric encourages unnecessarily harsh rules, "brutal confrontations", and a presumption that pain produces growth.[3][2]
The British think tank Demos asserts that tough love, understood as authoritative parenting in contrast to authoritarian parenting, is beneficial in the development of preferred character traits in children up to five years old.[10]

In most uses, there must be some actual love or feeling of affection behind the harsh or stern treatment to be defined as tough love. For example, genuinely concerned parents refusing to support their drug-addicted child financially until he or she enters drug rehabilitation would be said to be practicing tough love.[4][5]

The tough movement construction in English is similar to but distinct from pretty constructions and adjectives modified by too or enough:[14]
Ohkado suggested that the theme construction is a result of NP movement, while the location and goal constructions are a result of wh-movement. This suggests that while both location and goal constructions contain a wh-island, the theme construction does not and therefore allows for clause internal scrambling.

(t stands for trace and indicates the gap left in the constituent's original position; the subscript i is an index to show that the subject originated from the trace position.)
As observed by van der Auwera and Noël (2011),[2] Dutch appears to have a much more limited range of predicates which trigger tough movement than English does:
In clauses without an explicit subject, the subject is assumed to be a null/covert (unpronounced) pronoun, designated PRO, which Chomsky called "arbitrary in reference,"[10] although the referent(s) may be assumed from context. The evidence for the subject being PRO is that it can participate in partial control, for example:[11]: 292–293
Furthermore Chomsky suggested that instead of separate rules for tough movement, comparative deletion, topicalization, clefting, object-deletion, adjective and adjective-qualifier complements, etc., all might be explained by a more general wh-movement analysis.[9]: 110

In a 1993 doctoral thesis Ohkado proposed that Japanese has three types of tough constructions, according to whether the sentence begins with a Theme argument, a Location argument, or a Goal argument .[6] An example of each of these types of constructions can be seen below:

In these two examples, the null PRO is understood to refer to both i and j (both Gilgamesh and Enkidu in the first example; both Finn and Hengest in the second), distinct from the tough movement subject k; partial control is when a controller or antecedent of the subject of an embedded clause is a subset of the understood subject of the embedded clause.[12]

In a thesis supervised by Chomsky, Peter Rosenbaum addressed the construction, identifying "the class of adjectives including "difficult," "easy," and several others." Rosenbaum introduced a transformation analysis, in which the object of the verb phrase moves out of the complement sentence and is raised to the main subject position:[8]

Tough movement occurs in Spanish, as in (6a) and (7a).[3] Equivalent sentences without tough movement also occur, as in (6b) and (7b).
This type of movement also occurs with noun phrases[1] like a delight, a pleasure, a breeze, or a cinch, as well as with the complex verb take a long time:

Getting herself arrested is said without a subject, and yet herself is understood to refer to Betsy. Due to the need for an extra rule to account for this under "Tough Deletion," a movement analysis is preferred.[13]

Unlike English, Dutch raising predicates do not include noun phrases.
In classical government and binding theory it is no longer assumed that the object is moved directly to the subject position. Rather, Chomsky (1977)[9] proposed thatthe subject NP is base-generated in the main clause, and a null operator raises within in the embedded clause:
Ohkado, Kikuyo (1993). Tough constructions in Japanese (MA). McGill University.
In (1) and (2), the (a) examples illustrate tough movement in English. In (1a) this problem is logically the object of solve, and (1a) can be paraphrased as (1b) or (1c). In (2a) Chris is logically the object of please, and (2a) can be paraphrased as (2b) or (2c).
Tough constructions in Japanese are formed by combining verb stems such as 'yomi' to read, and one of the adjectives 'yasui' meaning easy to, or 'nikui' meaning difficult to, resulting in a form like 'yomiyasui' easy to read, or 'yominikui' difficult to read. According to Inoue there are 4 types of tough constructions in Japanese[5] simply labelled as Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV an example of each of these is shown below. Inoue remarked that the difference between these types depended on the verb and broadly categorized Types I and II as containing verbs where the action is controlled by the agent of the sentence, and the verbs in Types III and IV as containing verbs where the action is not controlled by the agent.
An alternative explanation for tough constructions involves no movement, relying instead on "Tough Deletion," wherein the subject appears twice in the underlying form, both in the main subject and embedded object positions, and the latter is then deleted, like so:
Example of a tough construction in Japanese is given in (9a).

The class of words that can trigger tough-movement in Spanish is smaller than in English; in Spanish only adjectives can do so, not noun phrases like in English. According to Sauer (1972),[4] Spanish tough-movement adjectives must in general express some degree of difficulty. However, in certain dialects adjectives like interesante 'interesting' also participate in tough-movement: thus, the sentence in (8) was accepted as grammatical by 7 out of 16 native Spanish speakers:[3]
"At this library, it is easy for Taroo to read the book."
In formal syntax, tough movement refers to sentences in which the syntactic subject of the main verb is logically the object of an embedded non-finite verb. Because the object of the lower verb is absent, such sentences are also sometimes called "missing object constructions". The term tough movement reflects the fact that the prototypical example sentences in English involve the word tough.
Reider (1993)[3] conducted a survey where 16 native speakers of Spanish (eight European and eight Latin American) answered whether they thought 27 sentences showing tough movement with different adjectives were grammatical, and found that Latin American Spanish speakers tended to accept tough movement with more adjectives, but there was considerable variability between speakers; no two speakers had the exact same response for all 27 sentences. This led Reider to propose that rather than a semantic reason for why certain adjectives can trigger tough movement and others cannot, instead it may be encoded separately for each word in a speaker's mental lexicon.

Noam Chomsky noted the existence of such constructions (though not by name) in Current Issues in Linguistic Theory (1964), giving the example 'John is easy to please' and noting that John is the direct object of the verb please. He contrasted it with the sentence 'John is eager to please,' where instead John is the logical subject of please, in order to illustrate that a single static phrase structure tree is inadequate to explain the underlying phenomenon.[7]
