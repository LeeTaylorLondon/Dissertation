Whiel some of these are quite funny, I think it should be stressed that they do not speak for the quality of Wikipedia in general. Wikipedia, by its nature as an encyclopedia is a secondary source, not to compete with primary sources, particularly not with those of scientific nature. Due to the collaborative effort it may well compete with journalistic sources, particularly if you are skeptical about what you read! I think it does a very good job in providing easy-to-understand background if you do not want to go the full way to read the primary sources, and it can be used to scrutinize media.

With so much fake news floating around these days, it's difficult to know just who and what to believe. While Wikipedia is usually a reliable source of factual information, from time to time people hack Wiki and slip some alternative facts in there too. And since it's a free encyclopedia, created entirely by collaborators, it turns out that some of them have quite a knack for humor. From Charlie Sheen being half man, half cocaine to American Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky being a humanoid evolution spawned in the bowels of Poseidon, you never can be too sure if what you're reading is 100% truth. So common sense comes in handy if you are preparing a paper according to Wikipedia's facts.

Outrageous is the seventh level of the Special Zone in Super Mario World. The level takes place in a dark forest, with tree trunks and a canopy of brown leaves present throughout the level.
The entire level can be flown through if the player has a cape. Otherwise, the player will have to first navigate through a barrage of Turtle Cannons, Jumping Boards, many different enemies, and a few Blocks. Thankfully, there is a ? Block that contains either a Super Mushroom or Fire Flower, depending on Mario or Luigi's state. This segment of the level comes to an end once a tall orange Warp Pipe comes into view. From that point on, the player will have to deal with Amazing Flyin' Hammer Brothers and Jumping Piranha Plants in between many gaps and tall pipes. In the middle of this segment, there is a ? Block containing a Yoshi. Just before the Giant Gate, two more Blasters will appear below an Amazing Flyin' Hammer Brother.
Outrageous consists of one long screen that the player has 300 seconds on the timer to traverse. This level has five Dragon Coins in it. It is crowded with Wigglers, Jumping Piranha Plants, and Amazing Flyin' Hammer Brothers. There are also numerous Turtle Cannons that shoot Bullet Bills to block Mario or Luigi's jumps. Fire Snakes are also present.

Spears has only performed the song during The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. It was the last song of the fifth act of the show, titled "Security Cameras". She performed "Breathe on Me" wearing pink lingerie while emulating different sexual practices with her dancers.[34] After it ended, she put on a white trench coat while her dancers wore them in black and performed "Outrageous".[35] The act ended with a skit that segued into the finale performance of "(I Got That) Boom Boom".[36]
"Outrageous" was written and produced by R. Kelly, and was recorded at The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois.[1] Penelope Magnet and Christopher "Tricky" Stewart of production team RedZone were enlisted to produce Spears's vocals.[2] She recorded them at Battery Studios in New York City. The song was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.[1] On September 11, 2003, "Outrageous" was confirmed as one of the tracks from In the Zone.[3] Jive Records hoped the song would be released as the first single from the album, but Spears convinced them to release her collaboration with Madonna, "Me Against the Music".[4] The track was also one of the choices for second single along with "(I Got That) Boom Boom", but Spears selected "Toxic" instead.[5] On June 1, 2004, it was announced that "Outrageous" would be released as the fourth single from the album and would be sent to radio stations on June 29, 2004. It was also announced that the track would be the theme song from the 2004 film Catwoman.[6] "Outrageous" was sent to mainstream radio in the United States on July 20, 2004.[7]

"Outrageous" is a hip hop and R&B song.[8] The beat was compared by Gavin Mueller of Stylus Magazine to R. Kelly's 2003 single "Snake".[9] Jennifer Vineyard of MTV noted that "she whispers and moans [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel".[10] Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine compared the background vocals to those of Punjabi musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.[11] According to the sheetmusic published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, "Outrageous" is composed in the key of D major, with a tempo of 105 beats per minute.[12] The song's lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with Spears referencing in the chorus a number of things that give her pleasure, such as "my world tour" and "my sex drive". Vineyard noted, "the cumulative effect seems like it's designed to put the listener in the lover's shoes—taking full advantage of the aural male gaze".[10] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said the track "includes a telling parallel that reveals a lot about one of music's biggest—as Alanis Morissette would put it—treadmill capitalists: she sings "my sex drive" and "my shopping spree" with the same dripping gusto".[13]

"Outrageous" received mixed reviews from music critics. Mim Udovitch of Blender called the song an "R. Kelly club number, [that] has a hot, odd compulsion and lyrics that are practically big-pimpin', Spears-style".[14] William Shaw of Blender selected it as the ninth best Spears song, highlighting "the nonsense chants" at 1:10.[15] While reviewing Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, Ann Powers commented, "'Outrageous' is R. Kelly's dirty little take on the ideal Janet Jackson song".[16] Spence D. of IGN said of the song that "it's a somewhat derivative Egyptian lover groove number. Yet for all it's [sic] repetitiveness, it's still kind of funky and pervasive".[17] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it "[a] composition that cruises along on autopilot for two minutes and then suddenly switches gears with a delectable Michael Jackson-inspired bridge".[18] Annabel Leathes of the BBC stated that "R. Kelly transform[s] Britney into a grubby Beyoncé".[19] Caryn Ganz of Spin called "Outrageous" a "go-nowhere homage to living fabulously".[20] Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic called it "a forgettable but nonetheless catchy single".[21] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that along with "(I Got That) Boom Boom", "[they] are little more than wobbly, rhythm-based contraptions intended to advance Spears' sex-princess-on-the-loose image".[22] Jamie Gill of Yahoo! Music Radio commented that, "with its cheap, tinny production – it would take a rather senile and unworldly old lady in Tonbridge Wells[sic] to find this even diverting, let alone shocking".[23]

The music video for "Outrageous" was directed by Dave Meyers, who previously worked in the music videos for "Lucky" and "Boys", as well as the Curious commercials.[28] It was shot in outdoors locations in Queens and Manhattan, New York City. The music video was set to premiere on MTV on June 28, 2004.[6] After completion of the scenes with guest star Snoop Dogg, Spears was shooting dance scenes in Manhattan when around 11:30 pm, she fell and injured her left knee.[29][30] She was taken immediately to a local hospital, where doctors performed an MRI scan and found floating cartilage. The following day, Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. Spears was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused the rest of the shoot as well as the remainder of The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[30] "Outrageous" was also scrapped as the theme song from Catwoman.[31] A 45-second music video composed of the scenes that were shot was released in the 2004 DVD Greatest Hits: My Prerogative. The video begins with Snoop Dogg and a group of men playing basketball in an outdoors court, until Spears appears wearing blue baggy shorts.[32] She starts to flirt with him, before jumping into his arms and licking his beard. In the next scene, she performs with her dancers on a street at night.[33]
