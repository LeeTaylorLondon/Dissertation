Polished plate is a type of hand-made glass. It is produced by casting glass onto a table and then subsequently grinding and polishing the glass. This was originally done by hand, and then later by machine. It was an expensive process requiring a large capital investment.[1]
Other methods of producing hand-blown window glass included: broad sheet, blown plate, crown glass and cylinder blown sheet. These methods of manufacture lasted at least until the end of the 19th century.The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as rolled plate, machine drawn cylinder sheet, flat drawn sheet, single and twin ground polished plate, and float glass.
In 1773 English polished plate (by the French process) was produced at Ravenhead.

The Frenchman, Louis Lucas de Nehou, in 1688, in conjunction with Abraham Thevart, succeeded in perfecting the process of casting plate-glass. Mirror plates previous to the invention had been made from blown "sheet" glass, and were consequently very limited in size. De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table rendered the manufacture of very large plates possible.[2]
By 1800 a steam engine was used to carry out the grinding and polishing of the cast glass.

The Polish Wikipedia (Polish: Polskojęzyczna Wikipedia) is the Polish-language edition of Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia. Founded on September 26, 2001, it now has more than 1,559,000 articles, making it the 11th-largest Wikipedia edition overall.[1] It is also the second-largest edition in a Slavic language, after the Russian Wikipedia.

The text of the Polish Wikipedia was first published on a DVD together with the paper edition of the magazine Enter SPECIAL in August 2005. The publisher did not make any attempt to contact the Wikimedia Foundation prior to making the DVD available on the market, and the edition itself turned out to be illegal, as it violated the GNU FDL license. Additionally, the software used on the DVD worked improperly on Microsoft Windows 98.

In July 2005, the tsca.bot bot program was instructed to upload statistics from official government pages about French, Polish, and Italian municipalities to the Polish Wikipedia. In a few months, the bot uploaded more than 40,000 articles.[citation needed] On October 13, 2009, the Polish Wikipedia received a "special recognition for social innovation" at the 2009 Jan Łukasiewicz Award ceremony, which recognises the most innovative Polish IT companies.[4][5] The Polish Wikipedia exceeded 1,000,000 articles on September 24, 2013.[citation needed] In April 2016, the project had 1,140 active editors who made at least five edits in that month.
A second DVD edition was prepared as a joint project of Wikimedia Polska (the Polish branch of the Wikimedia Foundation) and the Polish publisher Helion. It contained articles written before June 4, 2006. The edition was completed on November 24, 2006 and released at the end of July 2007 with a purchase price of 39 zlotys.[6]
