Reduces the detection radius of an infused  Golden Instinct, therefore reducing the area needed to cover to search for the detected item.

Narrow Minded is a great option for Warframes with damage self-buffs that do not rely on Range, such as  Saryn's  Toxic Lash and  Mirage's  Eclipse. Rhino and  Valkyr can also opt to use Narrow Minded to greatly extend the duration of  Roar and  Warcry, respectively, but must be mindful to inform allies to stay very close to them to share the buffs.
Useful for a stealth-centered  Ivara build to greatly extend the duration of her toggled  Prowl.

May be useful on defensive builds for  Limbo, as it allows him to defend objectives using  Cataclysm for longer without interfering with other Warframes, as well as reducing the chance that a stray Nullifier will cancel out the bubble.
Useful for a slowing  Nova build as Molecular Prime size is increased in size by Duration and the amount of slow effect on enemies is caused by greater Ability Strength. Also reduces the range of the  Null Stars flying away accidentally when they are used for damage reduction.

Recommended to use on  Mesa as most of her abilities are not affected by Ability Range, but her  Shooting Gallery and  Shatter Shield durations are greatly increased, at the cost of a smaller stun range for Shooting Gallery. Her  Peacemaker's energy drain also gets greatly reduced, but the minimum FoV will be reduced.
Useful for prolonging the staggering effects of  Yareli's  Aquablades when engaging in melee, as the blades' effective range is unaffected by the Ability Range penalty.

Equip this mod on frames that do not rely on Ability Range, or use  Stretch and/or  Overextended to compensate for the loss in range.

Required for  Loki to sustain extended duration  Invisibility (still vulnerable between recasts) for extended solo stealth runs.
Highly recommended for  Chroma tank builds utilizing Cold  Elemental Ward and  Vex Armor, as both abilities cost a great deal of energy when used simultaneously and the user can be extremely vulnerable between casts. As an added benefit, neither ability requires range if used specifically for tanking purposes.

A must in a  Titania build focusing on  Razorwing, as the minimization of energy drain while not sacrificing Ability Strength is the most important part of the build. Plus, the ability isn't affected by Ability Range.
