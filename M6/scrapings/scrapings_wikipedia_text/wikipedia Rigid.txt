Ridgid tools are targeted at the plumbing, pipe fitting, construction, and HVAC trades. The brand is best known for its distinctive red pipe wrenches,[2][3] but the company manufactures over 300 different types of tools.[1] The company also sells power tools, largely made by TTI, and wet/dry vacs, made by parent company Emerson.[4]

The Ridge Tool Company is an American manufacturing company that makes and distributes tools under the Ridgid brand name. The company was founded in 1923 in North Ridgeville, Ohio.[1] In 1943, it relocated to its current location in Elyria, Ohio, and in 1966, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Emerson Electric.[2]

The above statement does not define a mathematical property.Instead, it describes in what sense the adjective rigid is typically used in mathematics, by mathematicians.
Holomorphic functions are determined by the set of all derivatives at a single point. A smooth function from the real line to the complex plane is not,in general, determined by all its derivatives at a single point, but it is if we require additionally that it be possible to extend the function to one on a neighbourhood of the real line in the complex plane. The Schwarz lemma is an example of such a rigidity theorem.
Structural rigidity, a mathematical theory describing the degrees of freedom of ensembles of rigid physical objects connected together by flexible hinges.
A well-ordered set is rigid in the sense that the only (order-preserving) automorphism on it is the identity function.Consequently, an isomorphism between two given well-ordered sets will be unique.
Linear maps L(X, Y) between vector spaces X, Y are rigid in the sense that any L ∈ L(X, Y) is completely determined by its values on any set of basis vectors of X.
Rigidity results in K-theory show isomorphisms between various algebraic K-theory groups.
In mathematics, a rigid collection C of mathematical objects (for instance sets or functions) is one in which every c ∈ C is uniquely determined by less information about c than one would expect.
In combinatorics, the term rigid is also used to define the notion of a rigid surjection, which is a surjection f:n→m{\displaystyle f:n\to m} for which the following equivalent conditions hold:[1]

f{\displaystyle f} maps initial segments of n{\displaystyle n} to initial segments of m{\displaystyle m}.
This relates to the above definition of rigid, in that each rigid surjection f{\displaystyle f} uniquely defines, and is uniquely defined by, a partition of n{\displaystyle n} into m{\displaystyle m} pieces. Given a rigid surjection f{\displaystyle f}, the partition is defined by n=f−1(0)⊔⋯⊔f−1(m−1){\displaystyle n=f^{-1}(0)\sqcup \cdots \sqcup f^{-1}(m-1)}. Conversely, given a partition of n=A0⊔⋯⊔Am−1{\displaystyle n=A_{0}\sqcup \cdots \sqcup A_{m-1}}, order the Ai{\displaystyle A_{i}} by letting Ai≺Aj⟺minAi<minAj{\displaystyle A_{i}\prec A_{j}\iff \min A_{i}<\min A_{j}}. If n=B0⊔⋯⊔Bm−1{\displaystyle n=B_{0}\sqcup \cdots \sqcup B_{m-1}} is now the ≺{\displaystyle \prec }-ordered partition, the function f:n→m{\displaystyle f:n\to m} defined by f(i)=j⟺i∈Bj{\displaystyle f(i)=j\iff i\in B_{j}} is a rigid surjection.
Mostow's rigidity theorem, which states that the geometric structure of negatively curved manifolds is determined by their topological structure.
By the fundamental theorem of algebra, polynomials in C are rigid in the sense that any polynomial is completely determined by its values on any infinite set, say N, or the unit disk. By the previous example, a polynomial is also determined within the set of holomorphic functions by the finite set of its non-zero derivatives at any single point.

the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - in this case the two sides are the same, and the mirror image of the object is also the same, again after a rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.
The position of a rigid body is the position of all the particles of which it is composed. To simplify the description of this position, we exploit the property that the body is rigid, namely that all its particles maintain the same distance relative to each other. If the body is rigid, it is sufficient to describe the position of at least three non-collinear particles. This makes it possible to reconstruct the position of all the other particles, provided that their time-invariant position relative to the three selected particles is known. However, typically a different, mathematically more convenient, but equivalent approach is used. The position of the whole body is represented by:

The linear position can be represented by a vector with its tail at an arbitrary reference point in space (the origin of a chosen coordinate system) and its tip at an arbitrary point of interest on the rigid body, typically coinciding with its center of mass or centroid. This reference point may define the origin of a coordinate system fixed to the body.

"curvilinear" (=along a curved line, from Latin curvus = curved, and linere = spread).
However, depending on the application, a convenient choice may be:

a point such that the translational motion is zero or simplified, e.g. on an axle or hinge, at the center of a ball and socket joint, etc.
In general, when a rigid body moves, both its position and orientation vary with time. In the kinematic sense, these changes are referred to as translation and rotation, respectively. Indeed, the position of a rigid body can be viewed as a hypothetic translation and rotation (roto-translation) of the body starting from a hypothetic reference position (not necessarily coinciding with a position actually taken by the body during its motion).
For a (rigid) rectangular transparent sheet, inversion symmetry corresponds to having on one side an image without rotational symmetry and on the other side an image such that what shines through is the image at the top side, upside down. We can distinguish two cases:

Thus, the position of a rigid body has two components: linear and angular, respectively.[3]The same is true for other kinematic and kinetic quantities describing the motion of a rigid body, such as linear and angular velocity, acceleration, momentum, impulse, and kinetic energy.[4]

^ In kinematics, linear means "along a straight or curved line" (the path of the particle in space). In mathematics, however, linear has a different meaning. In both contexts, the word "linear" is related to the word "line". In mathematics, a line is often defined as a straight curve. For those who adopt this definition, a curve can be straight, and curved lines are not supposed to exist. In kinematics, the term line is used as a synonym of the term trajectory, or path (namely, it has the same non-restricted meaning as that given, in mathematics, to the word curve). In short, both straight and curved lines are supposed to exist. In kinematics and dynamics, the following words refer to the same non-restricted meaning of the term "line":"linear" (= along a straight or curved line),"rectilinear" (= along a straight line, from Latin rectus = straight, and linere = spread),"curvilinear" (=along a curved line, from Latin curvus = curved, and linere = spread).In topology and meteorology, the term "line" has the same meaning; namely, a contour line is a curve.
^ In general, the position of a point or particle is also known, in physics, as linear position, as opposed to the angular position of a line, or line segment (e.g., in circular motion, the "radius" joining the rotating point with the center of rotation), or basis set, or coordinate system.

The acceleration in reference frame N of the point R moving in body B while B is moving in frame N is given by
For two points P and Q that are fixed on a rigid body B, where B has an angular velocity NωB{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }}} in the reference frame N, the velocity of Q in N can be expressed as a function of the velocity of P in N:[7]
If C is the origin of a local coordinate system L, attached to the body,the spatial or twist acceleration of a rigid body is defined as the spatial acceleration of C (as opposed to material acceleration above):
the sheet surface with the image is not symmetric - in this case the two sides are different, but the mirror image of the object is the same, after a rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.
A sheet with a through and through image is achiral. We can distinguish again two cases:
By differentiating the equation for the Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body in N with respect to time, the acceleration in reference frame N of a point Q fixed on a rigid body B can be expressed as
Velocity (also called linear velocity) and angular velocity are measured with respect to a frame of reference.
In the study of special relativity, a perfectly rigid body does not exist; and objects can only be assumed to be rigid if they are not moving near the speed of light. In quantum mechanics, a rigid body is usually thought of as a collection of point masses. For instance, molecules (consisting of the point masses: electrons and nuclei) are often seen as rigid bodies (see classification of molecules as rigid rotors).
Any point that is rigidly connected to the body can be used as reference point (origin of coordinate system L) to describe the linear motion of the body (the linear position, velocity and acceleration vectors depend on the choice).
ω(t){\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}(t)} represents the angular velocity of the rigid body
the center of mass of the whole system, which generally has the simplest motion for a body moving freely in space;
The total kinetic energy is simply the sum of translational androtational energy.
Vehicles, walking people, etc., usually rotate according to changes in the direction of the velocity: they move forward with respect to their own orientation. Then, if the body follows a closed orbit in a plane, the angular velocity integrated over a time interval in which the orbit is completed once, is an integer times 360°. This integer is the winding number with respect to the origin of the velocity. Compare the amount of rotation associated with the vertices of a polygon.
If the point R is moving in the rigid body B while B moves in reference frame N, then the velocity of R in N is
where rPQ{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {PQ} }} is the position vector from P to Q.[7], with coordinates expressed in N (or a frame with the same orientation as N.) This relation can be derived from the temporal invariance of the norm distance between P and Q.

Angular velocity is a vector quantity that describes the angular speed at which the orientation of the rigid body is changing and the instantaneous axis about which it is rotating (the existence of this instantaneous axis is guaranteed by the Euler's rotation theorem). All points on a rigid body experience the same angular velocity at all times.During purely rotational motion, all points on the body change position except for those lying on the instantaneous axis of rotation. The relationship between orientation and angular velocity is not directly analogous to the relationship between position and velocity.Angular velocity is not the time rate of change of orientation, because there is no such concept as an orientation vector that can be differentiated to obtain the angular velocity.

Possible motions in the absence of external forces are translation with constant velocity, steady rotation about a fixed principal axis, and also torque-free precession.
r0{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{0}} represents the position of the point/particle with respect to the reference point of the body in terms of the local coordinate system L (the rigidity of the body means that this does not depend on time)
where Q is the point fixed in B that instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest.[8]This equation is often combined with Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body.
Roy Featherstone (1987). Robot Dynamics Algorithms. Springer. ISBN 0-89838-230-0. This reference effectively combines screw theory with rigid body dynamics for robotic applications. The author also chooses to use spatial accelerations extensively in place of material accelerations as they simplify the equations and allow for compact notation.
In this case, rigid bodies and reference frames are indistinguishable and completely interchangeable.

The configuration space of a rigid body with one point fixed (i.e., a body with zero translational motion) is given by the underlying manifold of the rotation group SO(3). The configuration space of a nonfixed (with non-zero translational motion) rigid body is E+(3), the subgroup of direct isometries of the Euclidean group in three dimensions (combinations of translations and rotations).

As mentioned above, all points on a rigid body B have the same angular velocity NωB{\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }} in a fixed reference frame N, and thus the same angular acceleration NαB.{\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}^{\mathrm {B} }.}
where NαB{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {{}^{\mathrm {N} }\!{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}^{\mathrm {B} }}} is the angular acceleration of B in the reference frame N.[7]
In physics, a rigid body (also known as a rigid object[2]) is a solid body in which deformation is zero or so small it can be neglected. The distance between any two given points on a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces or moments exerted on it. A rigid body is usually considered as a continuous distribution of mass.
There are several ways to numerically describe the orientation of a rigid body, including a set of three Euler angles, a quaternion, or a direction cosine matrix (also referred to as a rotation matrix). All these methods actually define the orientation of a basis set (or coordinate system) which has a fixed orientation relative to the body (i.e. rotates together with the body), relative to another basis set (or coordinate system), from which the motion of the rigid body is observed. For instance, a basis set with fixed orientation relative to an airplane can be defined as a set of three orthogonal unit vectors b1, b2, b3, such that b1 is parallel to the chord line of the wing and directed forward, b2 is normal to the plane of symmetry and directed rightward, and b3 is given by the cross product b3=b1×b2{\displaystyle b_{3}=b_{1}\times b_{2}}.
A(t){\displaystyle A(t)\,} is the orientation matrix, an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1, representing the orientation (angular position) of the local coordinate system L, with respect to the arbitrary reference orientation of another coordinate system G. Think of this matrix as three orthogonal unit vectors, one in each column, which define the orientation of the axes of L with respect to G.
The (linear) momentum is independent of the rotational motion. At any time it is equal to the total mass of the rigid body times the translational velocity.
a(t,r0){\displaystyle \mathbf {a} (t,\mathbf {r} _{0})} represents the total acceleration of the point/particle
The linear velocity of a rigid body is a vector quantity, equal to the time rate of change of its linear position. Thus, it is the velocity of a reference point fixed to the body.During purely translational motion (motion with no rotation), all points on a rigid body move with the same velocity.However, when motion involves rotation, the instantaneous velocity of any two points on the body will generally not be the same. Two points of a rotating body will have the same instantaneous velocity only if they happen to lie on an axis parallel to the instantaneous axis of rotation.

The velocity of point P in reference frame N is defined as the time derivative in N of the position vector from O to P:[6]
where Q is the point fixed in B that is instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest.[8]This relation is often combined with the relation for the Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body.

where O is any arbitrary point fixed in reference frame N, and the N to the left of the d/dt operator indicates that the derivative is taken in reference frame N.The result is independent of the selection of O so long as O is fixed in N.
The angular momentum with respect to the center of mass is the same as without translation: at any time it is equal to the inertia tensor times the angular velocity. When the angular velocity is expressed with respect to a coordinate system coinciding with the principal axes of the body, each component of the angular momentum is a product of a moment of inertia (a principal value of the inertia tensor) times the corresponding component of the angular velocity; the torque is the inertia tensor times the angular acceleration.
the angular position (also known as orientation, or attitude) of the body.
In kinematics, linear means "along a straight or curved line" (the path of the particle in space). In mathematics, however, linear has a different meaning. In both contexts, the word "linear" is related to the word "line". In mathematics, a line is often defined as a straight curve. For those who adopt this definition, a curve can be straight, and curved lines are not supposed to exist. In kinematics, the term line is used as a synonym of the term trajectory, or path (namely, it has the same non-restricted meaning as that given, in mathematics, to the word curve). In short, both straight and curved lines are supposed to exist. In kinematics and dynamics, the following words refer to the same non-restricted meaning of the term "line":"linear" (= along a straight or curved line),"rectilinear" (= along a straight line, from Latin rectus = straight, and linere = spread),"curvilinear" (=along a curved line, from Latin curvus = curved, and linere = spread).In topology and meteorology, the term "line" has the same meaning; namely, a contour line is a curve.
In general, the position of a point or particle is also known, in physics, as linear position, as opposed to the angular position of a line, or line segment (e.g., in circular motion, the "radius" joining the rotating point with the center of rotation), or basis set, or coordinate system.
