The Bland Group Ltd. is made up of a number of small and medium-sized operating companies based in Gibraltar, the United Kingdom and Morocco.
During the twenty-first century, the Bland Group opted to secure stakes in several companies related to the development and operation of hovercraft. These include manufacturer Griffon Hovercraft, services and charter operator Hoverwork Ltd, technical specialists Hovercraft Consultants Ltd, and scheduled operator Hovertravel.[4][5] Under the Bland Group's direction, several of these entities have been merged or otherwise closely cooperate for mutual benefits; other changes have included lean manufacturing investments and a focus on after-sales services to customers.[6]

The Bland Group was affected by the deterioration of relations between Spain and Gibraltar, particularly the closure of the land border in June 1969.[1] Throughout the 1970s, the firm made efforts to diversify into the wider transportation and tourism sectors. Investment in overseas ventures increased as well, at the expense of its traditional ferry services; the last car ferry to be built for the Bland Group was completed in 1954.[1] Prior to the 1960s, the Upper Rock was out of bounds to all but military personnel. To better access this area, the Bland Group secured permission from the Ministry of Defence to construct the Gibraltar Cable Car. Further access to the frontier was permitted in 1985; the public availability of this landmass has help shape both the Bland Group and the wider economy of Gibraltar itself more towards the tourism sector.[2]
In 1931, the Bland Group opted to start its own airline to serve the local market; this venture was initially named Gibraltar Airways.[1] It originally operated a single Saro Windhover flying boat, providing an aerial link between Gibraltar and Tangiers capable of carrying up to six passengers. Following the building of a runway at Gibraltar during the Second World War,Gibraltar Airways took advantage of this development during peacetime to introduce larger land-based aircraft.[1] It was also involved in the ground-handling and facilities management of Gibraltar International Airport in a civil context, as well as influencing its subsequent expansion.[1]
During 1810, English merchant Marcus Henry Bland arrived in Gibraltar, shortly thereafter, he established what would become the Bland Group.[1] His decision to found the company in Gibraltar was in part driven by its location, it being the first guaranteed friendly port for British shipping after leaving the British homelands. The business's initial activities was as a shipping agency, but it soon branched out into other related services.[2]

Since 1891, the Gaggero family has been a dominant force in the management of the business.[3] Then-owner John Bland lacked any direct heirs and thus opted to sell the Bland Group to his clerk, Joseph Gaggero.[2] By 1904, Emmanuel Gaggero was in charge of the Bland Group's towing and salvage operations, opting to invest in fast vessels that could outrun competitors to respond to distress calls from third party shipping. During the early 1900s, the Bland Group continued to expand its fleet, focusing on commercial trade between North Africa, Spain, and the United Kingdom.[1] During the First World War, the company's fleet came under attack as a result of Germany's decision to initiate unrestricted submarine warfare; two of its vessels, the Gibel Yedid I and the Gibel Hamam I were sunk, while a third, the Gibel Derif, successfully evaded a submarine attack.[1]

During the interwar period, the Bland Group continued to expand by sea, coal becoming a staple cargo.[1] In addition to investing in a series of new vessels to serve its historic routes between Gibraltar, Spain, Morocco, and Algeria, the firm opted to establish Transatlantic shipping routes between Gibraltar and the United States in this era. In 1928, George Gaggero directed the introduction of a pioneering car ferry service across the Straits.[1] During the Second World War, many of the Bland Group's facilities, including its shipping agency, repair yard, and coal bunkers, operated under the direction of the British Government's War Office. Following the conflict, the firm continued its traditional services; during the 1950s, its car ferries were claimed to have been shipping in excess of 100,000 cars per year across the Straits.[1]
James Gaggero is chairman of the board of directors.[citation needed]
Over time, Gibraltar Airways' fleet came to numerous jetliners which were operated upon numerous routes; its services were predominantly orientated towards the United Kingdom.[1] In 1989, the airline moved its headquarters to Britain, being based at Gatwick Airport. Gibraltar Airways was renamed multiple times, being known as "GibAir" throughout much of its operating life and as GB Airways during its final decades of independent operation.[1] In 1995, the airline became a franchisee of British Airways. At its peak in 2007, GB Airways operated a total of 16 Airbus A320 family airliners, and was reportedly carrying three million passengers annually.[1] During 2008, it was announced that the Bland Group had sold GB Airways to British budget airline EasyJet; its staff and aircraft were integrated into the operations of its new parent company.[1]

Ownership of the company was transferred to Marcus' grandsons, Marcus Horatio Bland and John Bland; four generations of the Bland family were involved in the Bland Group's management and ownership.[2] In 1861, the firm was involved in the purchase of the Adelia, a 69-ton tug, which has become known as the first Bland ship; it regularly carried traffic between Gibraltar and Tangier, Morocco in its lifetime.[1] The Bland Group, having identified lucrative commercial opportunities in the shipping industry, embarked on a rapid expansion in the sector through the latter half of the nineteenth century. Having initially focused on transporting freight across the Straits, the firm branched into combined cargo-and-passenger transport using a fleet of multi-purpose vessels; other activities ranged from postal runs on behalf of the Royal Gibraltar Post Office to towing and salvage operations.[1]
Prior to Bland, English case law on the non-treatment of patients was restricted to newborn babies. There have been several recorded cases of disabled neonates being "allowed to die". A leading case was that of Re B (a minor).[1] That case involved a baby with Down syndrome complicated by intestinal obstruction which, if left untreated without surgery, would be fatal. The parents felt that it would be in the child's best interests if she were left to die. This was a decision upheld by Lord Justice Dunn at first instance, who lauded the parents' decision as being "an entirely reasonable one".

On 28 June 2017, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that David Duckenfield, the police commander, would be charged with manslaughter by gross negligence in relation to the deaths of the other 95 victims, but a charge could not apply in relation to Bland because he died outside of the time limit that was applicable for the time of the alleged offence.[8]

In R v Arthur[4] a baby was born in 1981 with uncomplicated Down Syndrome and was rejected by the parents. Leonard Arthur, a paediatrician, wrote in his notes that the "Parents do not wish it to survive. Nursing care only." The baby died 69 hours later. During the trial, the defence provided evidence that the child was not physically healthy, resulting in a reduced charge of attempted murder, for which Arthur was acquitted.

On 21 December 1993, Bradford coroner James Turnbull recorded a verdict of accidental death on Tony Bland.[5] The same verdict was recorded on the other 95 victims (94 who died on the day of the disaster and a 95th who died a few days later) at the main Hillsborough inquest in March 1991, much to the dismay of the bereaved families who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing and for manslaughter charges to be brought against the police who had been patrolling the match.[6] On 26 April 2016, during the second inquest on all 96 victims, a verdict of Unlawful Killing was issued on all 96 victims.[7]

He was transferred to the care of J. G. Howe, a consultant geriatrician and neurologist at the Airedale General Hospital near his home in Keighley. He had some experience in treating those with PVS. Several attempts were made by Howe and his team, along with Bland's father, sister and mother, to try to elicit some response from him and for some signs of interaction. However, all attempts failed. He showed no sign of being aware of anything that took place around him.
This case is another which delegated to the Bolam standard. This was a test introduced by the courts in Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee. The essence of the Bolam standard is such as to remove liability from medical staff if the treatment they have provided to a patient under the particular circumstances would have been followed by a responsible body of medical personnel, exercising due skill and care in the process. Under Bolam, a doctor need only show that he was following an accepted medical practice – even if that practice was only followed by a minority of medical professionals. This was one of the arguments put forward on behalf of Dr Howe; that it would be intolerable if Dr Howe was charged with murder for following what he submitted to be generally regarded as good medical practice.

Tony Bland was one of two people injured at Hillsborough to have been diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. The other was 22-year-old Andrew Devine, from the Liverpool area, who also suffered massive brain damage as a result of being deprived of oxygen due to crush injuries. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, his parents were warned by doctors that he was likely to die within a few months. In 1994, five years after the disaster and one year after the death of Tony Bland, Devine's family claimed to have seen him following a moving object with his eyes. By March 1997, Devine was able to communicate to others using a touch-sensitive buzzer to answer "yes" or "no" to questions asked.[11] By the time of the disaster's 20th anniversary in April 2009, it was reported that he continued to show signs of awareness around him but his condition had barely improved since he was first reported to have emerged from the coma 12 years earlier.[12] Devine died in July 2021, 32 years after the disaster, with Liverpool coroner Andre Rebello recording a verdict of unlawful killing, making him the 97th victim.[13]

EEG and CT scans revealed that whilst the brain stem remained intact, there was no cortical activity. Indeed, scans subsequently shown to the court showed more space than substance in the relevant part of his brain. His body was being kept alive by artificial nutrition, hydration and constant care. The medical professionals treating him stated that there was no reasonable possibility that he would ever emerge from his vegetative state.

In the aftermath of Bland's death, a priest and anti-abortion campaigner, James Morrow, started a legal challenge to have the doctor who withdrew his treatment charged with murder, but this was rejected by the High Court in April 1994.

Such was the importance of the case, and its legal ramifications, that it attracted a number of expert witnesses to give evidence. These included Professor Bryan Jennett who, along with Professor Fred Plum, coined the term 'persistent vegetative state' in 1972. Professor Jennett expressed the view that it would be in accordance with good medical practice in the case of Anthony Bland to withdraw the nasogastric artificial feeding. He considered that there was no benefit to continue with the treatment as there was no prospect of recovery of cognitive function.
It is difficult now [in 2006] to convey my shock on receiving his intimidating reply. Having stated that he [the Coroner] had no jurisdiction over any living person, he advised that I would risk a murder charge should I withdraw treatment. He made it clear that he "... could not countenance, condone, approve or give consent to any action or inaction which could be or could not be construed as being designed or intended to shorten or terminate the life of this young man. This particularly applies to the withholding of the necessities of life, such as food and drink." He requested a reply by return indicating that I had understood his opinion, and whether I would withdraw treatment.
any subsequent treatment given should be for the sole purpose of enabling him to end his life in dignity and free from pain and suffering
This demonstrated that a doctor who deliberately withdrew life-prolonging treatment under any circumstances, and where the patient subsequently died, could be charged with murder. There was a subtle exception. If a patient suffered complications but the doctors felt that it would serve no purpose to apply additional treatments, such as antibiotics to fight infection, as might happen in a case of PVS, and the patient subsequently died as a result of the complication, then they were not liable under the criminal law. Theoretically, however, they could still find themselves being sued for negligence by the family of the deceased.
In August 1989, four months after Bland was injured, Howe contacted Popper, the Sheffield coroner, who was both legally and medically qualified. He informed Popper of the plan to withdraw all treatment including food and water. This decision had been taken following full consultation with the family and in accordance with their wishes. Howe later said:

Laing, J 2008 'Food and Fluids: Human Law, Human Rights and Human Interests' in Artificial Nutrition and Hydration C. Tollefsen, ed., Springer Press, pp. 77-100
Although Bland survived the initial crush, he had suffered severe brain damage and eventually became the disaster's 96th victim on 3 March 1993, aged 22, after being in a coma for nearly four years. He never regained consciousness and a legal ruling in November 1992 allowed doctors to withdraw his treatment at the request of his family, as there had been no sign of improvement in his condition and the doctors treating him advised that there was no reasonable possibility that he would ever emerge from his persistent vegetative state, and was unlikely to survive more than five years.[citation needed]
A long-time critic of the Bland case, Dr Jacqueline Laing argues that the implications of the judicial decision deserve revisiting given recent Freedom of Information Act requests revealing financial incentives and staggering compliance[clarification needed][9] in rolling out the 2008 NHS End-Of-Life Care strategy. She warns that Bland has been dangerously extended by the Mental Capacity Act 2005 so that novel third parties now have power to remove treatment.[10]

Following the obtaining of the legal advice, which concurred with that of the coroner, the Airedale National Health Service Trust, with the support of Bland's family and Howe, made an application to court to withdraw all life-prolonging treatment. As Bland was unable to speak for himself and was, for legal purposes, deemed an incompetent, the Official Solicitor was assigned as his guardian ad litem. The Official Solicitor opposed the Trust's application because if the Trust were allowed to pursue the actions proposed by Howe, it would amount in law to the crime of murder.

Neuropathological findings in cases of Persistent Vegetative State, Catholic Quarterly, February 1995
Anthony David Bland (21 September 1970 – 3 March 1993) was a supporter of Liverpool F.C. injured in the Hillsborough disaster. He suffered severe brain damage that left him in a persistent vegetative state as a consequence of which the hospital, with the support of his parents, applied for a court order allowing him to "die with dignity". As a result, he became the first patient in English legal history to be allowed to die by the courts through the withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment including food and water.
Acting on Anthony Bland's behalf, the Official Solicitor appealed this decision.
I am confident that from my knowledge of other patients, neuropsychology, previous cases from the literature and from animal experimentation that the patient has no awareness nor can he suffer pain or experience pleasure. Further the prospect of improvement can also confidently be answered since based on what we know of the degree of damage to his brain, the comparison of his case with those recorded in the literature (particularly considering the nature of his damage and the duration of his illness) and the type of systems and signs he exhibits, there is no hint or hope or any prospect of improvement.
Bland was an 18-year-old Liverpool supporter who travelled with two friends to Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough football ground for an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. During the game, a crush behind the Liverpool goal ensued due to the police losing control of the situation outside the ground. A crush had formed at the outer gates, and the Liverpool fans were eventually let in through a side gate by order of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. However, he failed to close the tunnel access first and thousands more Liverpool fans were sent down this tunnel into pens 3 and 4 which were already overcrowded due to the failure of police officers and club stewards to direct the fans to the appropriate areas. This resulted in the death of 94 people on that day, and a 95th victim in hospital a few days later.

Airedale NHS Trust applied to the courts for a declaration to the effect that:
This declaration, apart from the latter part of the declaration[clarification needed] (which was deemed inappropriate[clarification needed]), was granted. The court considered that it was in the patient's best interests for treatment to be withheld and that its discontinuance was in accordance with good medical practice.

Bland suffered serious injuries in the crush at the Leppings Lane terrace. He suffered crushed ribs and two punctured lungs, causing an interruption in the supply of oxygen to his brain. As a result, he sustained catastrophic and irreversible damage to the higher centres of the brain, which had left him in a persistent vegetative state (PVS).
The case brought up a number of moral and legal issues. As a result, the number of previous cases referred to is extensive.
Other experts in the field of neurology gave evidence. Amongst those was Professor Peter O'Behan who examined Bland on behalf of the Official Solicitor. Like the experts who gave evidence for the Airedale Trust, Prof. O'Behan's evidence was pessimistic. He stated:
