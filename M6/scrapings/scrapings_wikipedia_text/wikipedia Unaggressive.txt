Most of the described species are poorly known and rarely encountered. The most widely distributed, and most commonly encountered, species is T. loriae (itself a possible species complex), which accounts for 66% of all Toxicocalamus specimens in museum collections. T. loriae is frequently encountered in the Highlands, where large numbers have been collected in village gardens along the Wahgi River valley of Simbu Province, PNG.The next most frequently encountered and widely distributed species are T. preussi and T. stanleyanus. All the other species are much less well known and localised in distribution.

Toxicocalamus loriae (Boulenger, 1898) [10] – common worm-eating snake, Loria forest snake
Most species of Toxicocalamus are relatively small, the largest specimen known being the holotype of the recently described Toxicocalamus ernstmayri, which measures 1.1 m (43 in) snout-to-vent length (SVL) and 1.2 m (47 in) in total length (TTL). The second longest is the holotype of T. grandis, which measures 0.88 m (35 in) SVL, 0.98 m (39 in) TTL. Most species are under 0.80 m (31 in) TTL, and several are the thickness of bootlaces. In general females have longer bodies than males, but much shorter tails.

Although most species of Toxicocalamous are believed to be diurnal, they are fossorial, or semi-fossorial, in habit and rarely encountered.[3]
Many species of Toxicocalamus are localised in their distribution and associated with particular islands or mountain ranges. Several species are poorly known, with four known only from their holotypes. Toxicocalamus is probably not closely related to the Australian Elapidae, being endemic to the island of New Guinea,northern coastal offshore islands, i.e. Seleo Is. (Sandaun Province, PNG); Walis Is. and Tarawai Is. (East Sepik Province, PNG), and Karkar Is. (Madang Province, PNG), and the archipelagoes of Milne Bay Province to the southeast, i.e. d'Entrecasteaux Archipelago (Goodenough Is., Fergusson Is., and Normanby Is.), Woodlark Is., and the Louisiade Archipelago (Misima Is., Sudest Is., and Rossel Is.).[3][4][5]

Members of genus Toxicocalamus are venomous, with fixed front-fangs (a dental arrangement known as proteroglyphous), but are not known to be a threat to humans, being unaggressive, of modest size, and secretive. However, the venom of T. longissimus is believed to be fairly toxic, since it contains three-finger toxins (3FTx), Type-I phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP),[2] while T. buergersi possesses long venom glands than extend backwards into the body cavity.[1]

The prey of snakes in the genus Toxicocalamus appears to consist almost entirely of earthworms, particularly the giant earthworms of the Megascolecidae,[5] hence the adoption of the term "worm-eating snakes" for species within this genus.

Nota bene: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Toxicocalamus. These former genera, Apistocalamus, Apisthocalamus, Pseudapistocalamus, Pseudapisthocalamus, Ultrocalamus, and Vanapina, are now synonyms of Toxicocalamus.

During peak sexual activity, males engage in combat. This starts with one male rubbing his chin along the back of the other. The second male then raises his head as high as possible. As they both do the same, their necks intertwine. When the heads are level, they turn towards each other and push. Their bodies intertwine as they switch positions. They become oblivious to everything else, continuing even after they fall off a surface or into water. Sometimes, they intertwine and squeeze so tightly that their scales stand out from the pressure. They have also been observed to strike at each other with mouths closed. Occasionally, the combatants tire and break off the fight by "mutual consent", resting for a while before resuming once more. The event is settled when one of the two succeeds in pushing the other's head to the ground and raising his own by 20–30 cm. In captivity, combat may occur four or five times a week until courtship and copulation end.[5] Females can have 50 to 60 babies at a time. The young are born live.[20]

The color pattern is striking in the open, but in nature, typically among dead leaves under trees, it provides a high degree of camouflage; in a well-kept cage with a suitable base of dried leaves, overlooking several fully exposed specimens completely is easy.[citation needed] The pattern consists of a series of pale, subrectangular blotches running down the center of the back, interspaced with dark, yellow-edged, hourglass markings. The flanks have a series of fawn or brown rhomboidal shapes, with light vertical central bars. The belly is pale with irregular brown or black blotches. The head is white or cream with a fine, dark central line, black spots on the rear corners, and a dark blue-black triangle behind and below each eye.[12] The iris colour is cream, yellow-white, orange,[12] or silvery.[15]

The head is large and triangular, while the neck is greatly narrowed, only about one-third the width of the head.[5] A pair of "horns" is present between the raised nostrils—tiny in B. gabonica.[12] The eyes are large and moveable,[5] set well forward,[12] and surrounded by 15–21 circumorbital scales.[5] The species has 12–16 interocular scales across the top of the head. Four or five scale rows separate the suboculars and the supralabials, with 13–18 supralabials and 16–22 sublabials.[5] The fangs may reach a length of 55 mm (2.2 in),[4] the longest of any venomous snake.[5]

Originally a name given by the Portuguese, Gabon (Gabão) refers to the estuary on which the town of Libreville was built, in Gabon, and to a narrow strip of territory on either bank of this arm of the sea.As of 1909, Gaboon referred to the northern portion of French Congo, south of the equator and lying between the Atlantic Ocean and 12°E longitude.[11]
In Tanzania, this species is found in secondary thickets, cashew plantations, and agricultural land under bushes and in thickets. In Uganda, they are found in forests and nearby grasslands. They also do well in reclaimed forest areas - cacao plantations in West Africa and coffee plantations in East Africa. They have been found in evergreen forests in Zambia. In Zimbabwe, they only occur in areas of high rainfall along the forested escarpment in the east of the country. In general, they may also be found in swamps, as well as in still and moving waters. They are commonly found in agricultural areas near forests and on roads at night.[5]
Adults are typically 125–155 cm (4 to 5 ft) in total length (body and tail) with a maximum total length of 205 cm (81 in) for a specimen collected in Sierra Leone. The sexes may be distinguished by the length of the tail in relation to the total length of the body: around 12% for males and 6% for females. Adults, especially females, are very heavy and stout. One female measured at 174 cm (69 in) in total length, a head width of 12 cm (4.20 in), a width or circumference of 37 cm (14.65 in), and a weight of 8.5 kg (19 lb).[5]

Primarily nocturnal, Gaboon vipers have a reputation for being slow-moving and placid. They usually hunt by ambush, often spending long periods motionless, waiting for suitable prey to pass by, though they have been known to hunt actively, mostly during the first six hours of the night. In Kumasi, Ghana, they were regularly killed by ranch hands around some stables in an open field with the forest some 500 meters away—a sign that they were hunting rats in the grassland. They are usually very tolerant snakes, even when handled, and rarely bite or hiss, unlike most vipers. However, bites by bad-tempered individuals do occur.[12]
Bites from this species are extremely rare, because they are seldom aggressive and their range limited to rainforest areas.[4] Since they are sluggish and unwilling to move even when approached, the humans they bite are usually those accidentally stepping on them, and even then they may not be bitten.[21] When a bite does occur, it should always be considered a serious medical emergency. Even an average bite from an average-sized specimen is potentially fatal.[4] Antivenom should be administered as soon as possible to save the affected limb, or indeed the victim's life.[16]

In their description of B. gabonica, Spawls et al. (2004) give atotal length of 80–130 cm (32.0 to 51.5 in), with a maximum total length of 175 cm (69.3 in), saying the species may possibly grow larger still. They acknowledge reports of specimens over 1.8 m (6 ft), or even over 2 m (6.5 ft) in total length, but claimno evidence supports this.[12] A large specimen of 1.8 m (5.9 ft) total length, caught in 1973, was found to have weighed 11.3 kg (25 lb) with an empty stomach.[13] It is the heaviest venomous snake in Africa.[14]
In humans, a bite from a Gaboon viper causes rapid and conspicuous swelling, intense pain, severe shock, and local blistering. Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements, defecation, urination, swelling of the tongue and eyelids, convulsions, and unconsciousness.[5] Blistering, bruising, and necrosis may be extensive. Sudden hypotension, heart damage, and dyspnoea may occur.[12] The blood may become incoagulable, with internal bleeding that may lead to haematuria and haematemesis.[4][12] Local tissue damage may require surgical excision and possibly amputation to any affected limb.[4] Healing may be slow, and fatalities during the recovery period are not uncommon.[12]

From how sensitive monkeys were to the venom, Whaler (1971) estimated 14 mg of venom would be enough to kill a human being, equivalent to 0.06 mL of venom, or 1/50 to 1/1000 of what can be obtained in a single milking. Marsh and Whaler (1984) wrote that 35 mg (1/30 of the average venom yield) would be enough to kill a man of 70 kilograms (150 lb).[5] Branch (1992) suggested that 90–100 mg would be fatal in humans.
Midbody, the 28–46 dorsal scale rows are strongly keeled except for the outer rows on each side. The lateral scales are slightly oblique. The ventral scales number 124–140, rarely more than 132 in males, rarely less than 132 in females. With 17–33 paired subcaudal scales, males have no fewer than 25, and females no more than 23. The anal scale is single.[5]

Parry (1975) described how this species has a wider range of eye movement than other snakes. Along a horizontal plane, eye movement can be maintained even if the head is rotated up or down to an angle of up to 45°. If the head is rotated 360°, one eye will tilt up and the other down, depending on the direction of rotation. Also, if one eye looks forward, the other looks back, as if both are connected to a fixed position on an axis between them. In general, the eyes often flick back and forth in a rapid and jerky manner. When asleep,no eye movement occurs and the pupils are strongly contracted. The pupils dilate suddenly and eye movement resumes when the animal awakens.[5]

A study by Marsh and Whaler (1984) reported a maximum yield of 9.7 mL of wet venom, which translated to 2400 mg of dried venom. They attached "alligator" clip electrodes to the angle of the open jaw of anesthetized specimens (length 133–136 cm, girth 23–25 cm, weight 1.3–3.4 kg), yielding 1.3–7.6 mL (mean 4.4 mL) of venom. Two to three electrical bursts within a space of five seconds apart were enough to empty the venom glands. The Gaboon vipers used for the study were milked between seven and 11 times over a 12-month period, during which they remained in good health and the potency of their venom remained the same.[5]

Numerous descriptions have been givenof their generally unaggressive nature. Sweeney (1961) wrote they are so docile that they "can be handled as freely as any nonvenomous species", although this is absolutely not recommended. In Lane (1963), Ionides explained he would capture specimens by first touching them lightly on the top of the head with a pair of tongs to test their reactions. Hissing and anger were rarely displayed, so the tongs were usually set aside and the snakes firmly grasped by the neck with one hand and the body supported with the other as he picked them up and carried them to a box for containment. He said the snakes hardly ever struggled.[5]

Lenk et al. (1999) discovered genetic differences between the two conventionally recognized subspecies of B. g. gabonica and B. g. rhinoceros. According to their research, these two subspecies are as genetically different from each other as they are from B. nasicornis. Consequently, they regard the western form as a separate species, B. rhinoceros.[9]

The snake's venom is cytotoxic and cardiotoxic.[22] In mice, the LD50 is 0.8–5.0 mg/kg intravenously, 2.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally, and 5.0–6.0 mg/kg subcutaneously.[23] Since their venom glands are enormous, each bite produces the second-largest quantity of venom of any venomous snake; this is partially because, unlike many African vipers, such as the puff adder, the Gaboon viper does not release after a bite, which enables it to inject larger amounts of venom[citation needed]. Yield is probably related to body weight, as opposed to milking interval.[5] Brown (1973) gives a venom yield range of 200–1000 mg (of dried venom).[23] A range of 200–600 mg for specimens 125–155 cm in length has also been reported.[5] Spawls and Branch (1995) state from 5 to 7 mL (450–600 mg) of venom may be injected in a single bite.[4]

The Gaboon viper is usually found in rainforests and nearby woodlands, mainly at low altitudes,[15] but sometimes as high as 1500 m above sea level.[5] Spawls et al. (2004) mention a maximum altitude of 2100 m.[12] According to Broadley and Cock (1975), it is generally found in environments that are parallel to those occupied by its close relative, B. arietans, which is normally found in more open country.[16]

Because of their large, heavy body size, the adults have no trouble eating prey as large as fully grown rabbits. When prey happens by, they strike from any angle. They can quickly reposition their fangs if they happen to miss or strike an unsuitable area of their prey.[18] Once they strike their prey, they hang on to it with their large fangs rather than letting it go and waiting for it to die. This behaviour is very different from that of other species of vipers. These snakes feed on a variety of birds, mammals, and amphibians such as doves, guineafowl, francolins,[19] and many different species of rodents, including field mice and rats, as well as hares, rabbits, frogs, and toads.[19]More unlikely prey items, such as tree monkeys, the Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys), the brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus) and even the small royal antelope (Neotragus) have been reported.[5][19]
If threatened, Gaboon vipers may hiss loudly as a warning, doing so in a deep and steady rhythm, slightly flattening the head at the expiration of each breath.[5][12][17] Despite this, they are unlikely to strike unless severely provoked;[5] however, they are one of the fastest-striking snakes in the world, so care should be taken in handling them. It is best to avoid handling them in most circumstances.

The Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica), also called the Gaboon adder, is a viper species found in the rainforests and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa.[1][3][2] Like all other vipers, it isvenomous. It is the largest member of the genus Bitis,[4][5] and it has the longest fangs of any venomous snake – up to 2 inches(5 cm) in length – and the highest venom yield of any snake.[5][6] No subspecies are recognized.[3][7]

Although he canvasses disruption of international economic, political and military stability, including hacked nuclear missile launches, Bostrom thinks the most effective and likely means for the superintelligence to use would be a coup de main with weapons several generations more advanced than the current state of the art. He suggests nano-factories covertly distributed at undetectable concentrations in every square metre of the globe to produce a world-wide flood of human-killing devices on command.[24][25] Once a superintelligence has achieved world domination (a "singleton"), humanity would be relevant only as resources for the achievement of the A.I.'s objectives ("Human brains, if they contain information relevant to the AI’s goals, could be disassembled and scanned, and the extracted data transferred to some more efficient and secure storage format").[24]

A machine with general intelligence far below human level, but superior mathematical abilities is created.[24] Keeping the A.I. in isolation from the outside world, especially the internet, humans preprogram the A.I. so it always works from basic principles that will keep it under human control. Other safety measures include the A.I. being "boxed" (run in a virtual reality simulation) and being used only as an "oracle" to answer carefully defined questions in a limited reply (to prevent its manipulating humans).[24] A cascade of recursive self-improvement solutions feeds an intelligence explosion in which the A.I. attains superintelligence in some domains. The superintelligent power of the A.I. goes beyond human knowledge to discover flaws in the science that underlies its friendly-to-humanity programming, which ceases to work as intended. Purposeful agent-like behavior emerges along with a capacity for self-interested strategic deception. The A.I. manipulates humans into implementing modifications to itself that are ostensibly for augmenting its feigned modest capabilities, but will actually function to free the superintelligence from its "boxed" isolation (the "treacherous turn").[24]

Born as Niklas Boström in 1973[14] in Helsingborg, Sweden,[8] he disliked school at a young age, and ended up spending his last year of high school learning from home. He sought to educate himself in a wide variety of disciplines, including anthropology, art, literature, and science.[1] He once did some turns on London's stand-up comedy circuit.[8]

Bostrom believes that superintelligence, which he defines as "any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest," is a potential outcome of advances in artificial intelligence. He views the rise of superintelligence as potentially highly dangerous to humans, but nonetheless rejects the idea that humans are powerless to stop its negative effects.[11][12][failed verification] In 2017, he co-signed a list of 23 principles that all A.I. development should follow.[13]

Bostrom has provided policy advice and consulted for an extensive range of governments and organizations. He gave evidence to the House of Lords, Select Committee on Digital Skills.[51] He is an advisory board member for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute,[52] Future of Life Institute,[53] Foundational Questions Institute[54] and an external advisor for the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.[55][56]
In 1863 Samuel Butler's essay "Darwin among the Machines" predicted the domination of humanity by intelligent machines, but Bostrom's suggestion of deliberate massacre of all humanity is the most extreme of such forecasts to date. One journalist wrote in a review that Bostrom's "nihilistic" speculations indicate he "has been reading too much of the science fiction he professes to dislike".[25] As given in his later book, From Bacteria to Bach and Back, philosopher Daniel Dennett's views remain in contradistinction to those of Bostrom.[32] Dennett modified his views somewhat after reading The Master Algorithm, and now acknowledges that it is "possible in principle" to create "strong A.I." with human-like comprehension and agency, but maintains that the difficulties of any such "strong A.I." project as predicated by Bostrom's "alarming" work would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized, and at least 50 years away.[33] Dennett thinks the only relevant danger from A.I. systems is falling into anthropomorphism instead of challenging or developing human users' powers of comprehension.[34] Since a 2014 book in which he expressed the opinion that artificial intelligence developments would never challenge humans' supremacy, environmentalist James Lovelock has moved far closer to Bostrom's position, and in 2018 Lovelock said that he thought the overthrow of humanity will happen within the foreseeable future.[35][36]

He has suggested that technology policy aimed at reducing existential risk should seek to influence the order in which various technological capabilities are attained, proposing the principle of differential technological development. This principle states that we ought to retard the development of dangerous technologies, particularly ones that raise the level of existential risk, and accelerate the development of beneficial technologies, particularly those that protect against the existential risks posed by nature or by other technologies.[48]
Bostrom's theory of the Unilateralist's Curse[49] has been cited as a reason for the scientific community to avoid controversial dangerous research such as reanimating pathogens.[50]

In January 2015, Bostrom joined Stephen Hawking among others in signing the Future of Life Institute's open letter warning of the potential dangers of A.I.[28] The signatories "... believe that research on how to make AI systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that concrete research should be pursued today".[29] Cutting-edge A.I. researcher Demis Hassabis then met with Hawking, subsequent to which he did not mention "anything inflammatory about AI", which Hassabis, took as 'a win'.[30] Along with Google, Microsoft and various tech firms, Hassabis, Bostrom and Hawking and others subscribed to 23 principles for safe development of A.I.[13] Hassabis suggested the main safety measure would be an agreement for whichever A.I. research team began to make strides toward an artificial general intelligence to halt their project for a complete solution to the control problem prior to proceeding.[31] Bostrom had pointed out that even if the crucial advances require the resources of a state, such a halt by a lead project might be likely to motivate a lagging country to a catch-up crash program or even physical destruction of the project suspected of being on the verge of success.[24]

Aspects of Bostrom's research concern the future of humanity and long-term outcomes.[18][19] He discusses existential risk,[1] which he defines as one in which an "adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential." In the 2008 volume Global Catastrophic Risks, editors Bostrom and Milan M. Ćirković characterize the relation between existential risk and the broader class of global catastrophic risks, and link existential risk to observer selection effects[20] and the Fermi paradox.[21][22]

In later work, he has described the phenomenon of anthropic shadow, an observation selection effect that prevents observers from observing certain kinds of catastrophes in their recent geological and evolutionary past.[38] Catastrophe types that lie in the anthropic shadow are likely to be underestimated unless statistical corrections are made.

Employing online humans as paid dupes, and clandestinely hacking computer systems including automated laboratory facilities, the superintelligence mobilizes resources to further a takeover plan. Bostrom emphasizes that planning by a superintelligence will not be so stupid that humans could detect actual weaknesses in it.[24]

In 2005 Bostrom published the short story "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant" in the Journal of Medical Ethics.[45] A shorter version was published in 2012 in Philosophy Now.[46] The fable personifies death as a dragon that demands a tribute of thousands of people every day. The story explores how status quo bias and learned helplessness can prevent people from taking action to defeat aging even when the means to do so are at their disposal. YouTuber CGP Grey created an animated version of the story which has garnered over eight million views as of 2020.

In 1998, Bostrom co-founded (with David Pearce) the World Transhumanist Association[41] (which has since changed its name to Humanity+). In 2004, he co-founded (with James Hughes) the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, although he is no longer involved in either of these organisations. Bostrom was named in Foreign Policy's 2009 list of top global thinkers "for accepting no limits on human potential."[44]

In response to Bostrom's writing on artificial intelligence, Oren Etzioni wrote in an MIT Review article, "predictions that superintelligence is on the foreseeable horizon are not supported by the available data."[57] Professors Allan Dafoe and Stuart Russell wrote a response contesting both Etzioni's survey methodology and Etzioni's conclusions.[58]

In 2005, Bostrom founded the Future of Humanity Institute,[1] which researches the far future of human civilization. He is also an adviser to the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.[19]
In his 2014 book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Bostrom reasoned that the creation of a superintelligence represents a possible means to the extinction of mankind.[23] Bostrom argues that a computer with near human-level general intellectual ability could initiate an intelligence explosion on a digital time-scale with the resultant rapid creation of something so powerful that it might deliberately or accidentally destroy humanity.[24] Bostrom contends the power of a superintelligence would be so great that a task given to it by humans might be taken to open-ended extremes, for example a goal of calculating pi might collaterally cause nanotechnology manufactured facilities to sprout over the entire Earth's surface and cover it within days. He believes an existential risk to humanity from superintelligence would be immediate once brought into being, thus creating an exceedingly difficult problem of finding out how to control such an entity before it actually exists.[24]

Bostrom believes that the mishandling of indexical information is a common flaw in many areas of inquiry (including cosmology, philosophy, evolution theory, game theory, and quantum physics). He argues that an anthropic theory is needed to deal with these. He introduces the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA) and the Self-Indication Assumption (SIA), shows how they lead to different conclusions in a number of cases, and points out that each is affected by paradoxes or counterintuitive implications in certain thought experiments. He suggests that a way forward may involve extending SSA into the Strong Self-Sampling Assumption (SSSA), which replaces "observers" in the SSA definition with "observer-moments".

Bostrom points to the lack of agreement among most philosophers that A.I. will be human-friendly, and says that the common assumption is that high intelligence would have a "nerdy" unaggressive personality. However, he notes that both John von Neumann and Bertrand Russell advocated a nuclear strike, or the threat of one, to prevent the Soviets acquiring the atomic bomb. Given that there are few precedents to guide an understanding what, pure, non-anthropocentric rationality, would dictate for a potential singleton A.I. being held in quarantine, the relatively unlimited means of superintelligence might make for its analysis moving along different lines to the evolved "diminishing returns" assessments that in humans confer a basic aversion to risk.[24] Group selection in predators working by means of cannibalism shows the counter-intuitive nature of non-anthropocentric "evolutionary search" reasoning, and thus humans are ill-equipped to perceive what an artificial intelligence's intentions might be. Accordingly, it cannot be discounted that any superintelligence would inevitably pursue an 'all or nothing' offensive action strategy in order to achieve hegemony and assure its survival.[24] Bostrom notes that even current programs have, "like MacGyver", hit on apparently unworkable but functioning hardware solutions, making robust isolation of superintelligence problematic.[24]

To counter or mitigate an A.I. achieving unified technological global supremacy, Bostrom cites revisiting the Baruch Plan in support of a treaty-based solution and advocates strategies like monitoring and greater international collaboration between A.I. teams in order to improve safety and reduce the risks from the A.I. arms race.[24] He recommends various control methods, including limiting the specifications of A.I.s to, e.g., oracular or tool-like (expert system) functions[26] and loading the A.I. with values, for instance by associative value accretion or value learning, e.g., by using the Hail Mary technique (programming an A.I. to estimate what other postulated cosmological superintelligences might want) or the Christiano utility function approach (mathematically defined human mind combined with well-specified virtual environment). To choose criteria for value loading, Bostrom adopts an indirect normativity approach and considers Yudkowsky's[27] coherent extrapolated volition concept, as well as moral rightness and forms of decision theory.[24]
