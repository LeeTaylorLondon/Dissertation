Sané was born to Senegalese diplomats, and moved to France at the age of four. He chose to be a footballer, much to the chagrin of his father, and played football at amateur level. In 1982, he was called up for military service, and according to the law he could be based close to his home as a promising sportsman. For this to happen, the FFF had to send over the necessary papers, but due to Sané being on his summer holiday at the time, he was unable to contact his parents. The application was missed, and Sané was ordered to serve in Germany.[5]

SANE is a UK mental health charity working to improve quality of life for people affected by mental illness.
"Charity warns of 'mental illness timebomb' as calls increase by 200%"
SANE was established in 1986 to improve the quality of life for people affected by mental illness, following the overwhelming public response to a series of articles published in The Times entitled "The Forgotten Illness". Written by the charity's founder and Chief Executive, Marjorie Wallace, the articles exposed the neglect of people suffering from mental illness and the poverty of services and information for individuals and families. From its initial focus on schizophrenia (the name started as an acronym for "Schizophrenia: A National Emergency"[1]), SANE expanded and is now concerned with all mental illnesses.
