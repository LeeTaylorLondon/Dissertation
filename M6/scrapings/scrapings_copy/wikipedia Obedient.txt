After July 1953 she was used for Air-Sea rescue duties during air operations by aircraft carriers in the English Channel. After acceptance into the Reserve Fleet at Chatham in December that year she briefly commissioned for further service for trials in February 1956 but then returned to Reserve at Chatham. A proposal to convert this ship and Obdurate for use as anti-submarine frigates was not implemented and she was laid-up in Reserve at Hartlepool in 1957.[3] The ship was put on the Disposal List in 1961 and sold to the British Iron & Steel Corporation (BISCO) for demolition by Hughes Bolckow. She arrived in tow at the Breakers yard in Blyth on 19 October 1962.
