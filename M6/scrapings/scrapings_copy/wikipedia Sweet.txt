Sweet released only one more album, 1982's Blame It on Love, which featured the song "Voo Doo". The video for the song was played on MTV, and she performed the song on the musical TV show Solid Gold.[2] An album she recorded tracks for in 1982-83 remains unreleased.

Born in Akron, Ohio,[2][3]Sweet began her singing career at the age of three, when she won an electric garage door opener in a local talent contest after singing "I'm a Little Dutch Girl."[4] She began recording commercials at the age of six, toured with Mickey Rooney, and performed in Las Vegas as the opening act for Bill Cosby at the age of 12.[2][3][5] She began recording country music in 1974, but with little success beyond one minorhit.[2] Switching to rock and roll, she signed to Stiff Records and released her first album, Fool Around, in 1978, dropping out of high school to concentrate on her career, although she was still required to devote time to her studies.[2][6][7] Sweet was backed by The Records on the Stiff Records tour in 1978.[2] The album was a critical success, but sales were poor, although she did have some success with the single "B-A-B-Y" (a cover of the 1966 Carla Thomas song), which was a top-40 hit in the UK.[8] The record label generated some controversy by pushing a Lolita-like image for her.[2] Her follow-up album, Protect the Innocent, produced by Martin Rushent and Alan Winstanley,[9] was largely ignored by the public and the music press, although it was popular with her fans and launched a well-received North American tour in 1980 with her band The Toys. She signed to Columbia Records in 1981, releasing the album ... And Then He Kissed Me and its hit single "Everlasting Love", a duet with Rex Smith.[2] The album also includes "Shadows of the Night," later a hit for Pat Benatar.
Sweet opened for the Jerry Garcia Band on his 1980 winter tour including 2/28/80 at Kean College. It was a early and late show and the great Robert Hunter, lyricist for Garcia, sang and played with the band. The show is an official live album "After Midnight" and features a Eleanor Rigby tease.

In 1982, Sweet had a starring role in the low-budget musical film Rock 'n' Roll Hotel, which also featured Judd Nelson and was filmed in Richmond, Virginia, at the then-inoperative Jefferson Hotel. Shooting in Richmond with local extras began in October 1982 and was halted abruptly in December. The film's original 3D version, with scenes in the style of early MTV music videos, received only two screenings in 1983, in Los Angeles and New York. It was never released theatrically, even after it was eventually re-cut and completed in 1986 under the supervision of Sweet's father, Dick.[12]

The Sweet is a compilation album released as Sweet's debut album in the US and Canada, substituting for the 1971 UK album Funny How Sweet Co-Co Can Be. (The band's second album, Sweet Fanny Adams was also not given a US release, but tracks from that and the band's third album Desolation Boulevard were combined on the US version of that album to compensate for this.)[citation needed]
All songs written and composed by Brian Connolly, Steve Priest, Andy Scott and Mick Tucker except where noted.
