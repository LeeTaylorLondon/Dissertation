Lazy is the adjective for laziness, a lack of desire to expend effort.
Using a single source file instead allows the state to be shared between multiple functions, while still hiding it from non-related functions.
// This has concurrency issues.Here the read to types is not synchronized,
This is typically accomplished by augmenting an accessor method (or property getter) to check whether a private member, acting as a cache, has already been initialized.If it has, it is returned straight away. If not, a new instance is created, placed into the member variable, and returned to the caller just-in-time for its first use.

A fairly straightforward 'fill-in-the-blanks' example of a Lazy Initialization design pattern, except that this uses an enumeration for the type
* type. Instantiates new ones as needed. Uses double-checked locking
Here is an example in Ruby, of lazily initializing an authentication token from a remote service like Google. The way that @auth_token is cached is also an example of memoization.
// Note: constructor private forcing one to use static |GetFruit|.
Note that lazy initialization can also be used in non-object-oriented languages.

The following is an example of a class with lazy initialization implemented in ActionScript:
Using lazy initialization to instantiate the object the first time it is requested (lazy initialization pattern)
Here is an example of lazy initialization in PHP 7.4:
// Check again, after having acquired the lock to make sure
// the instance was not created meanwhile by another thread
In computer programming, lazy initialization is the tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed. It is a kind of lazy evaluation that refers specifically to the instantiation of objects or other resources.
If objects have properties that are rarely used, this can improve startup speed. Mean average program performance may be slightly worse in terms of memory (for the condition variables) and execution cycles (to check them), but the impact of object instantiation is spread in time ("amortized") rather than concentrated in the startup phase of a system, and thus median response times can be greatly improved.
//not an expensive item to create, but you get the point
# get_token_from_http_response, uri and params are defined later in the class
In the field of theoretical computer science, lazy initialization[3] (also called a lazy array) is a technique to design data structures that can work with memory that does not need to be initialized. Specifically, assume that we have access to a table T of n uninitialized memory cells (numbered from 1 to n), and want to assign m cells of this array, e.g., we want to assign T[ki] := vi for pairs (k1, v1), ..., (km, vm) with all ki being different. The lazy initialization technique allows us to do this in just O(m) operations, rather than spending O(m+n) operations to first initialize all array cells. The technique is simply to allocate a table V storing the pairs (ki, vi) in some arbitrary order, and to write for each i in the cell T[ki] the position in V where key ki is stored, leaving the other cells of T uninitialized. This can be used to handle queries in the following fashion: when we look up cell T[k] for some k, we can check if k is in the range {1, ..., m}: if it is not, then T[k] is uninitialized. Otherwise, we check V[T[k]], and verify that the first component of this pair is equal to k. If it is not, then T[k] is uninitialized (and just happened by accident to fall in the range {1, ..., m}). Otherwise, we know that T[k] is indeed one of the initialized cells, and the corresponding value is the second component of the pair.

The Fruit class itself doesn't do anything here, The class variable _typesDictionary is a Dictionary/Map used to store Fruit instances by typeName.
The 'non-lazy' alternative is to use an initialization method that is run when the object is created and then use a simpler accessor method to fetch the value.

These have the usual semantics, i.e. ifThenElse a b c evaluates (a), then if and only if (a) evaluates to true does it evaluate (b), otherwise it evaluates (c). That is, exactly one of (b) or (c) will be evaluated. Similarly for EasilyComputed || LotsOfWork, if the easy part gives True the lots of work expression could be avoided. Finally, when evaluating SafeToTry && Expression, if SafeToTry is false there will be no attempt at evaluating the Expression.

In lazy programming languages such as Haskell, although the default is to evaluate expressions only when they are demanded, it is possible in some cases to make code more eager—or conversely, to make it more lazy again after it has been made more eager. This can be done by explicitly coding something which forces evaluation (which may make the code more eager) or avoiding such code (which may make the code more lazy). Strict evaluation usually implies eagerness, but they are technically different concepts.
From version 2.2 forward, Python manifests lazy evaluation by implementing iterators (lazy sequences) unlike tuple or list sequences. For instance (Python 2):

In the function .mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}numberFromInfiniteList, the value of infinity is an infinite range, but until an actual value (or more specifically, a specific value at a certain index) is needed, the list is not evaluated, and even then it is only evaluated as needed (that is, until the desired index.) Provided the programmer is careful, the program completes normally. However, certain calculations may result in the program attempting to evaluate an infinite number of elements; for example, requesting the length of the list or trying to sum the elements of the list with a fold operation would result in the program either failing to terminate or running out of memory.

In Haskell, marking constructor fields strict means that their values will always be demanded immediately. The seq function can also be used to demand a value immediately and then pass it on, which is useful if a constructor field should generally be lazy. However, neither of these techniques implements recursive strictness—for that, a function called deepSeq was invented.

The number of beta reductions to reduce a lambda term with call-by-need is no larger than the number needed by call-by-value or call-by-name reduction.[17][18] And with certain programs the number of steps may be much smaller, for example a specific family of lambda terms using Church numerals take an infinite amount of steps with call-by-value (i.e. never complete), an exponential number of steps with call-by-name, but only a polynomial number with call-by-need. Call-by-need embodies two optimizations - never repeat work (similar to call-by-value), and never perform unnecessary work (similar to call-by-name).[19] Lazy evaluation can also lead to reduction in memory footprint, since values are created when needed.[20]

Lazy evaluation is often combined with memoization, as described in Jon Bentley's Writing Efficient Programs.[4] After a function's value is computed for that parameter or set of parameters, the result is stored in a lookup table that is indexed by the values of those parameters; the next time the function is called, the table is consulted to determine whether the result for that combination of parameter values is already available. If so, the stored result is simply returned. If not, the function is evaluated and another entry is added to the lookup table for reuse.

In computer windowing systems, the painting of information to the screen is driven by expose events which drive the display code at the last possible moment. By doing this, windowing systems avoid computing unnecessary display content updates.[15]
MATLAB implements copy on edit, where arrays which are copied have their actual memory storage replicated only when their content is changed, possibly leading to an out of memory error when updating an element afterwards instead of during the copy operation.[16]
Conversely, in an eager language the above definition for ifThenElse a b c would evaluate (a), (b), and (c) regardless of the value of (a). This is not the desired behavior, as (b) or (c) may have side effects, take a long time to compute, or throw errors. It is usually possible to introduce user-defined lazy control structures in eager languages as functions, though they may depart from the language's syntax for eager evaluation: Often the involved code bodies need to be wrapped in a function value, so that they are executed only when called.

// create the initial state (e.g. a vector of "negafibonacci" numbers)
In programming language theory, lazy evaluation, or call-by-need,[1] is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which also avoids repeated evaluations (sharing).[2][3]
In Python 3.x the range() function[28] returns a generator which computes elements of the list on demand. Elements are only generated when they are needed (e.g., when print(r[3]) is evaluated in the following example), so this is an example of lazy or deferred evaluation:
Delayed evaluation is used particularly in functional programming languages. When using delayed evaluation, an expression is not evaluated as soon as it gets bound to a variable, but when the evaluator is forced to produce the expression's value. That is, a statement such as x = expression; (i.e. the assignment of the result of an expression to a variable) clearly calls for the expression to be evaluated and the result placed in x, but what actually is in x is irrelevant until there is a need for its value via a reference to x in some later expression whose evaluation could itself be deferred, though eventually the rapidly growing tree of dependencies would be pruned to produce some symbol rather than another for the outside world to see.[10]
In C# and VB.NET, the class System.Lazy is directly used.
In practice, lazy evaluation may cause significant performance issues compared to eager evaluation. For example, on modern computer architectures, delaying a computation and performing it later is slower than performing it immediately. This can be alleviated through strictness analysis.[19] Lazy evaluation can also introduce memory leaks due to unevaluated expressions.[21][22]
This allows the previous example to be rewritten to be far more efficient.Where the original ran in time exponential in the number of iterations, the memoized version runs in linear time:
Incremental computing – a related concept whereby computations are only repeated if their inputs change. May be combined with lazy evaluation.

Lazy evaluation allows control structures to be defined normally, and not as primitives or compile-time techniques. For example one can define if-then-else and short-circuit evaluation operators:[11][12]
// yield the next value and suspend execution until resumed
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

However, there is an optimisation implemented in some compilers called strictness analysis, which, in some cases, allows the compiler to infer that a value will always be used. In such cases, this may render the programmer's choice of whether to force that particular value or not, irrelevant, because strictness analysis will force strict evaluation.
Note that Java's lambda expressions are just syntactic sugar.Anything you can write with a lambda expression can be rewritten as a call to construct an instance of an anonymous inner class implementing the interface,[a] and any use of an anonymous inner class can be rewritten using a named inner class, and any named inner class can be moved to the outermost nesting level.
Each iteration of the loop links a to a new object created by evaluating the lambda expression inside the loop.Each of these objects holds a reference to another lazy object, b, and has an eval method that calls b.eval() twice and returns the sum.The variable b is needed here to meet Java's requirement that variables referenced from within a lambda expression be effectively final.

Each class that implements the Lazy interface must provide an eval method, and instances of the class may carry whatever values the method needs to accomplish lazy evaluation.For example, consider the following code to lazily compute and print 210:
Delayed evaluation has the advantage of being able to create calculable infinite lists without infinite loops or size matters interfering in computation. The actual values are only computed when needed.For example, one could create a function that creates an infinite list (often called a stream) of Fibonacci numbers. The calculation of the n-th Fibonacci number would be merely the extraction of that element from the infinite list, forcing the evaluation of only the first n members of the list.[13][14]
As another example, the list of all Fibonacci numbers can be written in the Haskell programming language as:[14]
In Java, lazy evaluation can be done by using objects that have a method to evaluate them when the value is needed.The body of this method must contain the code required to perform this evaluation.Since the introduction of lambda expressions in Java SE8, Java has supported a compact notation for this. The following example generic interface provides a framework for lazy evaluation:[24][25]

Laziness can be useful for high performance scenarios. An example is the Unix mmap function, which provides demand driven loading of pages from disk, so that only those pages actually touched are loaded into memory, and unneeded memory is not allocated.

Lazy evaluation was introduced for lambda calculus by Christopher Wadsworth[5] and employed by the Plessey System 250 as a critical part of a Lambda-Calculus Meta-Machine, reducing the resolution overhead for access to objects in a capability-limited address space.[6] For programming languages, it was independently introduced by Peter Henderson and James H. Morris[7] and by Daniel P. Friedman and David S. Wise.[8][9]

Also, pattern matching in Haskell 98 is strict by default, so the ~ qualifier has to be used to make it lazy.[23]

In the .NET Framework it is possible to do lazy evaluation using the class System.Lazy.[29] The class can be easily exploited in F# using the lazy keyword, while the force method will force the evaluation. There are also specialized collections like Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.Seq that provide built-in support for lazy evaluation.

Java lambda expressions are not exactly equivalent to anonymous classes, see Anonymous function#Differences_to_Anonymous_Classes
Another example of laziness in modern computer systems is copy-on-write page allocation or demand paging, where memory is allocated only when a value stored in that memory is changed.[15]
In JavaScript, lazy evaluation can be simulated by using a generator. For example, the stream of all Fibonacci numbers can be written, using memoization, as:
^ Bentley, Jon Louis. Writing Efficient Programs. Prentice-Hall, 1985. ISBN 978-0139702440
This is an inefficient program because this implementation of lazy integers does not memoize the result of previous calls to eval.It also involves considerable autoboxing and unboxing. What may not be obvious is that, at the end of the loop, the program has constructed a linked list of 11 objects and that all of the actual additions involved in computing the result are done in response to the call to a.eval() on the final line of code.This call recursively traverses the list to perform the necessary additions.
Lazy evaluation is difficult to combine with imperative features such as exception handling and input/output, because the order of operations becomes indeterminate.
