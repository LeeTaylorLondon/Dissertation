In the film Forrest Gump of 1994, one edition of Curious George (one with a yellow cover but no other title than Curious George) is used as Forrest's favorite book, which his mother reads to him. In the opening scene a feather comes floating down to Forrest's feet and he stores it in this book. At the end of the film it falls out of the book and rises floating through the air again.

VEE Corporation, the company behind Sesame Street Live, is mounting Curious George Live.[23] It is a brand new national tour featuring song and dance and Curious George himself. It is based on the PBS animated series.
He is always referred to as "The Man" or fully "The Man with the Yellow Hat". But aside from those two names, he is unnamed in the original series and telefilm books. When people speak to George about the Man, they often refer to him as "Your friend". In H. A. Rey's book titled "See the Circus" published in 1946, "The Man with the Yellow Hat" was referred to as "Ted". Later, in Curious George (2006), the Man, who is voiced by Will Ferrell, is also referred to as "Ted" throughout the film, and his last name is revealed as being "Shackleford" in a deleted scene. In the TV series he is voiced by Jeff Bennett.
"'Minions' and Illumination Create a Blockbuster Animation Unit for Universal"
George is described as "a good little monkey, and always very curious". Despite being referred to as a monkey throughout the series, he is depicted without a tail. In the first book, George is caught by "The Man in the Yellow Hat" and taken from Africa to America where the two live together. George and the Man in the Yellow Hat become friends and are shown going on adventures together.
Curious George appeared in 1941. This book begins with George living in Africa and tells the story of his capture by the Man with the Yellow Hat, who takes him on a ship to "the big city" where he will live in a zoo. The second book, Curious George Takes a Job (1947), begins with George living in the zoo, from which he escapes and has several adventures before the Man with the Yellow Hat finds him and takes George to live at his house. The remaining five stories describe George's adventures while living at the house of the Man with the Yellow Hat. (Although the Man with the Yellow Hat is unnamed in both the original books and telefilm books, he receives his name in the Curious George TV series and is known as "Theodore Shackleford".)
A computer/traditionally animated film, Curious George, featuring Will Ferrell as the voice of the originally unnamed Man with the Yellow Hat, was released on February 10, 2006. In this film (in which The Man is referred to as "Ted"), Curious George secretly follows The Man onto the ship to the city on his own accord. Frank Welker provided the vocal effects of Curious George. Ron Howard serves as the film's producer.

Jarrod, the titular character and protagonist from the NBC series The Pretender, read Curious George books in Season One and developed a fascination with them. He likened himself to George and Sydney Green, the psychiatrist whom he saw as a surrogate father, to the Man with the Yellow Hat.

In 1983, animator John Clark Matthews produced a 16mm stop-motion animated short called Curious George Goes to the Hospital based on the book of the same name. In 1984, they created another short, again based on the book of the same name. Produced by Churchill Films, the films were created with puppet-figures.[14] Matthews later used a similar technique for his films of Frog and Toad.[15]

George's first appearance was as a monkey named "Fifi" in the book Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys, which was first published in France during 1939 in the late years.[1] The popularity of the character led the Reys to feature "George" in his own series.

A new Curious George series debuted on September 4, 2006, on PBS Kids as part of the PBS Kids Preschool Block. Although Curious George ended its original run on April 1, 2015, the series is still airing on PBS Kids in reruns.

A revival of the series was released on the streaming service Peacock on July 15, 2020.[10]Season 10 premiered on PBS on October 5, 2020.
Aside from George himself, the only recurring character in the original adventures is the Man with the Yellow Hat who is George's best friend. The Man often facilitates George's adventures by taking him somewhere, and even more often resolves the tension by intervening just in time to get George out of a tight spot. He is always seen wearing a bright yellow suit and a wide brimmed yellow hat. The Man is never mentioned by name in the original adventures or in any subsequent content over more than six decades.

The original series was written by the husband-and-wife team of Hans Augusto (H. A.) Rey and Margret Rey. The Jewish couple fled Paris in June 1940, on bicycles they'd made themselves, carrying the Curious George manuscript with them.[2][3]At first, only H. A. Rey was credited for the work in order to distinguish the Reys' books from the large number of children's books written by female authors. The first seven books were illustrated by H.A. Rey.[4] Later, Alan J. Shalleck was credited for the illustrations and Hans Rey and Margret Rey for the writing. The Reys produced many other children's books, but the Curious George series was the most popular. Each book has been in continuous print since it was first published.

Curious (Yellow) was a pop, alternative rock band formed in 1987 by Swedish-born Karin Jansson, a singer-songwriter and guitarist, formerly of feminist punk band Pink Champagne. Curious (Yellow) had releases on Red Eye Records – an EP, I Am Curious and an album Charms and Blues. Both were produced by Steve Kilbey of The Church, who was Jansson's domestic partner. The band's name and that of their first release are references to the 1967 Swedish cult film I Am Curious (Yellow).
By 1990, a second line-up had formed with Jansson and White joined by Mike Caen (Dragon) on guitar, Jim Bowman on guitar and Mark Dawson on drums. They released two singles, "Taken By Surprise" (August) and "Love Itself" (November), and an album Charms and Blues in September.[1] It was produced by the band and Kilbey, and issued on Red Eye Records and Polydor.[3] In the Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop, Ian McFarlane described the album as "combined airy ambience with melancholy pop".[1] The CD version of the album included "Down the Wishing Well" as a bonus track.[3]
The EP was produced by Kilbey, who also provided keyboards, programming, guitar and backing vocals.[3] The group performed locally and then toured Australia's east coast with fellow Red Eye artists The Bhagavad Guitars, The Crystal Set, and The Mexican Spitfires.[1] Jansson and Kilbey co-wrote The Church's hit single "Under the Milky Way" (February 1988),[1] and Curious (Yellow) often included their version in live performances. After Hall joined the Lime Spiders in December, the first line-up disbanded.
Curious (Yellow) was formed in Sydney in 1987 by Karin Jansson as a pop, alternative rock band.[1] Jansson was a guitarist in Swedish feminist punk band, Pink Champagne from 1979 to 1984.[2] That group had released two full-length albums, Vackra pojke! (Beautiful Boy!, 1981) and Kärlek eller ingenting (Love or Nothing, 1983).[2] She relocated to Australia in 1986 and was the domestic partner of Steve Kilbey – vocalist and bass guitarist of Australian alternative rockers, The Church.[1] Jansson recorded demos of her own songs and others she wanted to perform live.

The first line-up of Curious (Yellow) was Jansson with Mike Knapp on drums, and Phil Hall on guitar – both formerly of the punk band Dropbears – and Les White (aka Lez White) of New Zealand pop-rock group Th' Dudes on bass guitar.[1][3] In March 1988, Curious (Yellow) released an extended play I Am Curious on Red Eye Records.[1] Both the band's name and the EP title are a reference to the 1967 Swedish film "I Am Curious (Yellow)".[1]
