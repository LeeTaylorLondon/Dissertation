Bobby Mallon as Kid who gets paddled by the gang
Free Wheeling is a 1932 Our Gang short comedy film directed by Robert F. McGowan.It was the 117th (29th talking episode) Our Gang short that was released.
Free Wheeling was edited by a few minutes on the syndicated Little Rascals television packages in 1971 due to its racism toward African Americans. The film was restored on AMC airing from 2001 to 2003.The "free wheeling" downhill scenes involving the runaway car were filmed on Outpost Drive in Hollywood, California.
Confined to a neck brace, poor little rich boy Dickie would like to play with the neighborhood kids, but his overprotective mother will not let him. On the sly, however, Dickie sneaks out of his bedroom in search of adventure in the company of his best pal, Stymie. Purchasing a ride on the donkey-driven "taxicab" piloted by Breezy Brisbane, the boys, along with hitchhikers Spanky and Jacquie Lyn, experience enough thrills and excitement to last a lifetime when the taxi begins rolling down a steep hill minus brakes.[2]
