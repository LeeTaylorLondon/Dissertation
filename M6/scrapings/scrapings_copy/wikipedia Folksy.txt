I use the reduction printmaking method in which the printable area of the lino is gradually cut away as each colour is printed and by the end there is no printable surface left. This is why the prints are limited editions as it is not possible to print any more. This is printed in 5 colours. I have used Schminke water based ink on 300gsm Snowdon paper. This print is one of a limited edition of 12. Each print is numbered and signed. There may be slight differences in the prints due to their handmade nature but this is what gives them their unique character. The print size is 15 x 20cm and paper size is 21 x 30cm (A4).

The copper shows through this, giving the golden brown tones. I added scatterings of white enamel and black enamel to the centre of the dish. Then, while the dish was red hot, in my kiln, I drew a steel point through the surface to generate the random, swirled pattern you see. The dish is counter-enamelled black on the reverse.
