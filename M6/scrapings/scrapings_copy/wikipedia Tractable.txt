In 1929, three of the companies merged to form the engineering consultancy Electrobel, which constructed several Belgian power plants. The fourth, 'Mutuelle des Tramways' changed its name to 'Traction & Electricité' and later to 'Tractionel'. The two entities established their core business with projects such as the extension and upgrade of the Belgian power grid after the Second World War and the installation of Belgium’s nuclear power plants from 1969. More infrastructures; pipelines, dams, hydropower stations and complex buildings were also commissioned locally and abroad. In 1977, Coyne et Bellier (France), known for hydroelectric dams, joined the Electrobel group.[2]
The company was founded in 1952. In 1992 it became a fully owned and integrated member of the world wide net of TRACTEBEL ENGINEERING, an engineering arm of SUEZ ENERGY SERVICES (SES) and GDF SUEZ group.[4]
