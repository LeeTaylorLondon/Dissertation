He is identified by the ragged and patched Smurf clothes that he wears, including a Smurf hat that completely covers over his eyes. In the 1981 television series, his face is perpetually grimy, his hat is grubby and disheveled, and one of his pants' footings is perpetually torn, revealing his toes.
