Jonathan Crow of Allmovie gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and said, "Unloved is uninvolving and overly talky."[2] David Stratton of the Variety magazine said, "[Moriguchi] gives a good performance as the exacting heroine, while Nakamura and Matsuoka lend solid support as the two wildly contrasted guys."[3]

The lyrics are reportedly a mocking reference to The Cure's frontman Robert Smith, with whom lead singer Morrissey had a public feud with.
The song features a simple, repeating riff, playing throughout. A brief bass part can be heard before the vocal part kicks in, bringing the bass back to obscurity.
The song has never been covered live by Morrissey to date. However, he has been noted to quote the lyric "And if I seem a little strange, that's because I am." on occasion during concerts.

The track was considered for inclusion on the setlist, and was later soundchecked. At the last minute, an unmoveable piano was discovered in the wings of the concert venue's stage. It was then decided that Unloveable would be passed over in favour of performing Asleep live.
