The discussion so far has derived the independent feature model, that is, the naive Bayes probability model. The naive Bayes classifier combines this model with a decision rule. One common rule is to pick the hypothesis that is most probable so as to minimize the probability of misclassification; this is known as the maximum a posteriori or MAP decision rule. The corresponding classifier, a Bayes classifier, is the function that assigns a class label y^=Ck{\displaystyle {\hat {y}}=C_{k}} for some k as follows:

Sometimes the distribution of class-conditional marginal densities is far from normal. In these cases, kernel density estimation can be used for a more realistic estimate of the marginal densities of each class. This method, which was introduced by John and Langley,[9] can boost the accuracy of the classifier considerably.[12][2]

Here is a worked example of naive Bayesian classification to the document classification problem.Consider the problem of classifying documents by their content, for example into spam and non-spam e-mails. Imagine that documents are drawn from a number of classes of documents which can be modeled as sets of words where the (independent) probability that the i-th word of a given document occurs in a document from class C can be written as
ln⁡p(S∣D)p(¬S∣D)=ln⁡p(S)p(¬S)+∑iln⁡p(wi∣S)p(wi∣¬S){\displaystyle \ln {p(S\mid D) \over p(\neg S\mid D)}=\ln {p(S) \over p(\neg S)}+\sum _{i}\ln {p(w_{i}\mid S) \over p(w_{i}\mid \neg S)}}

With a multinomial event model, samples (feature vectors) represent the frequencies with which certain events have been generated by a multinomial (p1,…,pn){\displaystyle (p_{1},\dots ,p_{n})} where pi{\displaystyle p_{i}} is the probability that event i occurs (or K such multinomials in the multiclass case). A feature vector x=(x1,…,xn){\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} is then a histogram, with xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} counting the number of times event i was observed in a particular instance. This is the event model typically used for document classification, with events representing the occurrence of a word in a single document (see bag of words assumption). The likelihood of observing a histogram x is given by:
Naive Bayes classifiers are available in many general-purpose machine learning and NLP packages, including Apache Mahout, Mallet, NLTK, Orange, scikit-learn and Weka.
To estimate the parameters for a feature's distribution, one must assume a distribution or generate nonparametric models for the features from the training set.[9]

On discriminative vs. generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes
Another common technique for handling continuous values is to use binning to discretize the feature values and obtain a new set of Bernoulli-distributed features. Some literature suggests that this is required in order to use naive Bayes, but it is not true, as the discretization may throw away discriminative information.[4]

If a given class and feature value never occur together in the training data, then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero, because the probability estimate is directly proportional to the number of occurrences of a feature's value. This is problematic because it will wipe out all information in the other probabilities when they are multiplied. Therefore, it is often desirable to incorporate a small-sample correction, called pseudocount, in all probability estimates such that no probability is ever set to be exactly zero. This way of regularizing naive Bayes is called Laplace smoothing when the pseudocount is one, and Lidstone smoothing in the general case.

Despite the fact that the far-reaching independence assumptions are often inaccurate, the naive Bayes classifier has several properties that make it surprisingly useful in practice. In particular, the decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one-dimensional distribution. This helps alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality, such as the need for data sets that scale exponentially with the number of features. While naive Bayes often fails to produce a good estimate for the correct class probabilities,[15] this may not be a requirement for many applications. For example, the naive Bayes classifier will make the correct MAP decision rule classification so long as the correct class is predicted as more probable than any other class. This is true regardless of whether the probability estimate is slightly, or even grossly inaccurate. In this manner, the overall classifier can be robust enough to ignore serious deficiencies in its underlying naive probability model.[16] Other reasons for the observed success of the naive Bayes classifier are discussed in the literature cited below.

(This technique of "log-likelihood ratios" is a common technique in statistics.In the case of two mutually exclusive alternatives (such as this example), the conversion of a log-likelihood ratio to a probability takes the form of a sigmoid curve: see logit for details.)

The assumptions on distributions of features are called the "event model" of the naive Bayes classifier. For discrete features like the ones encountered in document classification (include spam filtering), multinomial and Bernoulli distributions are popular. These assumptions lead to two distinct models, which are often confused.[10][11]
"Why does Naive Bayes work better when the number of features >> sample size compared to more sophisticated ML algorithms?"
Rennie et al. discuss problems with the multinomial assumption in the context of document classification and possible ways to alleviate those problems, including the use of tf–idf weights instead of raw term frequencies and document length normalization, to produce a naive Bayes classifier that is competitive with support vector machines.[13]

Thus, the probability ratio p(S | D) / p(¬S | D) can be expressed in terms of a series of likelihood ratios.The actual probability p(S | D) can be easily computed from log (p(S | D) / p(¬S | D)) based on the observation that p(S | D) + p(¬S | D) = 1.
Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression,[3]: 718  which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.
Convergence is determined based on improvement to the model likelihood P(D∣θ){\displaystyle P(D\mid \theta )}, where θ{\displaystyle \theta } denotes the parameters of the naive Bayes model.
This means that under the above independence assumptions, the conditional distribution over the class variable C{\displaystyle C} is:

In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the simplest Bayesian network models,[1] but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve high accuracy levels.[2]

Consider a generic multiclass classification problem, with possible classes Y∈{1,...,n}{\displaystyle Y\in \{1,...,n\}}, then the (non-naive) Bayes classifier gives, by Bayes theorem:
Hierarchical Naive Bayes Classifiers for uncertain data (an extension of the Naive Bayes classifier).
Despite their naive design and apparently oversimplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many complex real-world situations. In 2004, an analysis of the Bayesian classification problem showed that there are sound theoretical reasons for the apparently implausible efficacy of naive Bayes classifiers.[5] Still, a comprehensive comparison with other classification algorithms in 2006 showed that Bayes classification is outperformed by other approaches, such as boosted trees or random forests.[6]

This training algorithm is an instance of the more general expectation–maximization algorithm (EM): the prediction step inside the loop is the E-step of EM, while the re-training of naive Bayes is the M-step. The algorithm is formally justified by the assumption that the data are generated by a mixture model, and the components of this mixture model are exactly the classes of the classification problem.[14]

where pki{\displaystyle p_{ki}} is the probability of class Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}} generating the term xi{\displaystyle x_{i}}. This event model is especially popular for classifying short texts. It has the benefit of explicitly modelling the absence of terms. Note that a naive Bayes classifier with a Bernoulli event model is not the same as a multinomial NB classifier with frequency counts truncated to one.
The multinomial naive Bayes classifier becomes a linear classifier when expressed in log-space:[13]
In many practical applications, parameter estimation for naive Bayes models uses the method of maximum likelihood; in other words, one can work with the naive Bayes model without accepting Bayesian probability or using any Bayesian methods.

When dealing with continuous data, a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a normal (or Gaussian) distribution. For example, suppose the training data contains a continuous attribute, x{\displaystyle x}. The data is first segmented by the class, and then the mean and variance of x{\displaystyle x} is computed in each class. Let μk{\displaystyle \mu _{k}} be the mean of the values in x{\displaystyle x} associated with class Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}}, and let σk2{\displaystyle \sigma _{k}^{2}} be the Bessel corrected variance of the values in x{\displaystyle x} associated with class Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}}. Suppose one has collected some observation value v{\displaystyle v}. Then, the probability density of v{\displaystyle v} given a class Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}}, i.e., p(x=v∣Ck){\displaystyle p(x=v\mid C_{k})}, can be computed by plugging v{\displaystyle v} into the equation for a normal distribution parameterized by μk{\displaystyle \mu _{k}} and σk2{\displaystyle \sigma _{k}^{2}}.

Finally, the document can be classified as follows.It is spam if p(S∣D)>p(¬S∣D){\displaystyle p(S\mid D)>p(\neg S\mid D)} (i. e., ln⁡p(S∣D)p(¬S∣D)>0{\displaystyle \ln {p(S\mid D) \over p(\neg S\mid D)}>0}), otherwise it is not spam.

The problem with the above formulation is that if the number of features n is large or if a feature can take on a large number of values, then basing such a model on probability tables is infeasible. The model must therefore be reformulated to make it more tractable. Using Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability can be decomposed as:
JNBC Naive Bayes Classifier running in-memory or using fast key-value stores (MapDB, LevelDB or RocksDB).
In the statistics literature, naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes.[4] All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method.[3][4]
Given a way to train a naive Bayes classifier from labeled data, it's possible to construct a semi-supervised training algorithm that can learn from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data by running the supervised learning algorithm in a loop:[14]
The link between the two can be seen by observing that the decision function for naive Bayes (in the binary case) can be rewritten as "predict class C1{\displaystyle C_{1}} if the odds of p(C1∣x){\displaystyle p(C_{1}\mid \mathbf {x} )} exceed those of p(C2∣x){\displaystyle p(C_{2}\mid \mathbf {x} )}". Expressing this in log-space gives:
Discriminative classifiers have lower asymptotic error than generative ones; however, research by Ng and Jordan has shown that in some practical cases naive Bayes can outperform logistic regression because it reaches its asymptotic error faster.[17]

where μ=5.855{\displaystyle \mu =5.855} and σ2=3.5033⋅10−2{\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}=3.5033\cdot 10^{-2}} are the parameters of normal distribution which have been previously determined from the training set. Note that a value greater than 1 is OK here – it is a probability density rather than a probability, because height is a continuous variable.
Assume for the moment that there are only two mutually exclusive classes, S and ¬S (e.g. spam and not spam), such that every element (email) is in either one or the other;

In the case of discrete inputs (indicator or frequency features for discrete events), naive Bayes classifiers form a generative-discriminative pair with multinomial logistic regression classifiers: each naive Bayes classifier can be considered a way of fitting a probability model that optimizes the joint likelihood p(C,x){\displaystyle p(C,\mathbf {x} )}, while logistic regression fits the same probability model to optimize the conditional p(C∣x){\displaystyle p(C\mid \mathbf {x} )}.[17]
For the classification as female the posterior is given by

The following example assumes equiprobable classes so that P(male)= P(female) = 0.5. This prior probability distribution might be based on prior knowledge of frequencies in the larger population or in the training set.

The left-hand side of this equation is the log-odds, or logit, the quantity predicted by the linear model that underlies logistic regression. Since naive Bayes is also a linear model for the two "discrete" event models, it can be reparametrised as a linear function b+w⊤x>0{\displaystyle b+\mathbf {w} ^{\top }x>0}. Obtaining the probabilities is then a matter of applying the logistic function to b+w⊤x{\displaystyle b+\mathbf {w} ^{\top }x}, or in the multiclass case, the softmax function.

Abstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model: it assigns probabilities p(Ck∣x1,…,xn){\displaystyle p(C_{k}\mid x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} for each of the K possible outcomes or classes Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}} given a problem instance to be classified, represented by a vector x=(x1,…,xn){\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} encoding some n features (independent variables).[8]
Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. There is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter.A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features.

A class's prior may be calculated by assuming equiprobable classes, i.e., p(Ck)=1K{\displaystyle p(C_{k})={\frac {1}{K}}}, or by calculating an estimate for the class probability from the training set:
Since posterior numerator is greater in the female case, the prediction is that the sample is female.

Naïve (pronounce: "na-EEV") is a French word which is used in English to mean that someone is very simple and does not understand about the dangers around them.Someone who is naïve does not have enough experience of life to know about things he or she ought to know; for example, they may be very trusting, not realizing that some people in the world are evil and that some situations are perilous.
Naïve art is art which is created by people who have not been trained as artists.

The word naïve is used in other special ways in the arts and sciences.It often means "lack of experience", but it does not necessarily mean it in a critical way.
The word is sometimes spelt in English without the French double dot on the letter i, "naive", due to the default settings for typing in English lacking it. It is an adjective.The noun is naïveté, but is sometimes spelt naïvety in English.It is similar in meaning to the word "innocent" and is not always a negative quality in that being naïve implies a lack of acquired prejudice.
Naïve realism is the way that most people see and understand the world.
In ecology it can mean animals that have not learned to be afraid of other animals that might attack and eat them.
