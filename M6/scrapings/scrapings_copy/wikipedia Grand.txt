^ a b Interview: Zak Penn's The Grand (ComingSoon.net Blog) – ComingSoon.net
Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson) is a recovering drug addict who, after many relapses, decides to move into a rehabilitation facility full-time. Having been married 75 times, he is a serial husband and is always on the lookout for number 76. He enters The Grand, a Texas Hold 'Em poker tournament in Las Vegas created by his grandfather Lucky Faro (Barry Corbin). His main motivation is to win the $10 million prize to cover a loan he got to keep open his family's casino, The Rabbit's Foot, which his grandfather left him when he died and that he has mismanaged since.
The Grand is a 2008 improv comedy film directed by Zak Penn. The film has an ensemble cast including Ray Romano, Woody Harrelson, Chris Parnell, Werner Herzog, Jason Alexander, Dennis Farina, David Cross, Gabe Kaplan, Michael Karnow and Cheryl Hines along with several real Las Vegas poker stars.[1]

According to Penn, the film is styled after those of Christopher Guest,[2] in which each actor is given direction concerning their character and the actors are left to improvise each individual scene. The plot of The Grand was somewhat more open-ended than Guest's work, however. The focus of the film is a poker tournament played at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas between the characters in which real poker matches were played by the actors as the scenes were filmed. The film's script did not specify the winner of the tournament, and the ending of the film was determined by the actual game played on set.[2]

The rest of the players "won" their seats in an online poker tournament. They include the Schwartzman twins, Larry (David Cross) and Lainie (Cheryl Hines), who have been forced into a sibling rivalry throughout their lives by their father, Seth (Gabe Kaplan). Another player, Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell), is a genius who still lives with his mother (Estelle Harris). Other contestants include Andy Andrews (Richard Kind), a math teacher, Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina), a wily old veteran of Vegas, and "The German" (Werner Herzog), a cheater who ritualistically sacrifices small animals to gain luck at cards.
