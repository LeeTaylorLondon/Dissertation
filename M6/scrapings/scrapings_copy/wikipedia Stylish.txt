In December 2016 Hindman began releasing updates to Stylish for Chrome[19] which returned a perfect replica of the user's browsing activity to Userstyles.[20] On 3 January 2017 he announced a "partnership" with SimilarWeb in which "Stylish users [would] be joining SimilarWeb’s market research panel.".[21] A Firefox web extension (3.0.1) was released on 10 November, after a final update (2.1.1) to the Stylish XUL+XPCOM add-on on 31 October to migrate user styles to a webextension-compatible database.[8][22]

A userscript manager such as Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey can add a local style sheet to a web page by adding the style sheet content to an HTML  tag and adding the tag to the page.[32] User styles from Userstyles.org can be downloaded as user scripts for use with a userscript manager.

Stylish was originally developed by Jason Barnabe as an XUL/XPCOM add-on for Mozilla Firefox. A Chrome extension followed in 2010,[5] which was released for Blink-based Opera 15 in 2013[6][7] and as a Firefox WebExtension in 2017.[8][9] Similar extensions for Safari[10] and for Presto-based Opera[11] are distributed as 'Stylish' by other developers with Barnabe's approval.[12][13]

In September 2016 Jason Barnabe, the creator of Stylish and userstyles.org, announced that, having lost interest in the project, he had "chosen Justin Hindman as the next leader of Stylish and userstyles.org."[15] Hindman had no prior connection to either Stylish or userstyles.org,[16] and it soon became clear that Barnabe had simply sold them to Hindman[17] in a straw purchase for Israeli analytics company SimilarWeb.[18]

In July 2018, after these issues were publicized by a software engineer,[23] Stylish was pulled from both the Chrome Web Store and Mozilla Add-ons, as well as being automatically uninstalled for all existing users.[24][25][26] Stylish returned to Mozilla Add-ons on 16 August[27] and to the Chrome Web Store on 5 November[19] with the same logic but sporting a new opt-in page asking users to agree to the data collection when the extension was installed.[28][29] Firefox now reports fewer users of Stylish than its more popular alternative, Stylus.[30][31]
