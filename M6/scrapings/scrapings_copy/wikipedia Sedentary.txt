In archaeology a number of criteria must hold for the recognition of either semi or full sedentism.

Non-agricultural sedentism requires good preservation and storage technologies, such as smoking, drying, and fermentation, as well as good containers such as pottery, baskets, or special pits in which to securely store food whilst making it available. It was only in locations where the resources of several major ecosystems overlapped that the earliest non-agricultural sedentism occurred. For example, people settled where a river met the sea, at lagoon environments along the coast, at river confluences, or where flat savanna met hills, and mountains with rivers.

The shift to sedentism is coupled with the adoption of new subsistence strategies, specifically from foraging (hunter-gatherer) to agricultural and animal domestication. The development of sedentism led to the rise of population aggregation and formation of villages, cities, and other community types.

According to Israeli archaeologist Ofer Bar-Yosef, they are as follows:[3][4]
In North America, evidence for sedentism emerges around 4500 BC.[citation needed]

Forced sedentism or sedentarization occurs when a dominant group restricts the movements of a nomadic group. Nomadic populations have undergone such a process since the first cultivation of land; the organization of modern society has imposed demands that have pushed aboriginal populations to adopt a fixed habitat.

At the end of the 19th and throughout the 20th century many previously nomadic tribes turned to permanent settlement. It was a process initiated by local governments, and it was mainly a global trend forced by the changes in the attitude to the land and real property and also due to state policies that complicated border crossing. Among these nations are Negev Bedouin in Jordan, Israel and Egypt,[11] Bashkirs, Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, Evenks, Evens, Sakha in the Soviet Union, Tibetan nomads in China,[12] Babongo in Gabon, Baka in Cameroon,[13] Innu in Canada, Gypsies in Romania and Czechoslovakia, etc.
In cultural anthropology, sedentism (sometimes called sedentariness; compare sedentarism[1]) is the practice of living in one place for a long time. As of 2023[update], the large majority of people belong to sedentary cultures. In evolutionary anthropology and archaeology, sedentism takes on a slightly different sub-meaning, often applying to the transition from nomadic society to a lifestyle that involves remaining in one place permanently. Essentially, sedentism means living in groups permanently in one place.[2] The invention of agriculture led to sedentism in many cases, but the earliest sedentary settlements were pre-agricultural.

Exotic climate preferences can only be obtained through Origins, conquest of a unique species, the A New Species event on a matching celestial body or when theOmnicodex relic creates a species on a matching celestial body.
Traits are purchased from a points pool, with 2 points being available at the start of the game. Some traits are negative and have a negative cost, refunding points into the pool. Each species is limited to a maximum of 5 traits; traits that cost 0 points do not count against this limit but can only be acquired from certain origins, events, or ascension perks.
Cyborg traits can only be added to species with the  Cybernetic trait if the empire has theIntegrated Anatomy tradition.
Not affected by Happiness unless the Artificial Intelligence policy is not set to Outlawed
Silicate traits are only available to species with the Lithoid archetype or empires that researched the  Silicate Transgenesis technology. The Lithoid trait is always present on Lithoid species.
−1% Pop Growth Speed per pops above 37 (max −10%)
These traits are required for special cases of species and cannot be removed from the creation menu.
Botanical traits are only available to species with the Fungoid or Plantoid archetype or empires that researched the  Botanical Transgenesis technology. Radiotrophic is also available to species with the Lithoid archetype, or for all empires that completed the Radioactive Flora terraforming event.
+1% Pop Growth Speed per pops below 37 (max +30%)
Leviathan traits can only be added by empires that researched the  Leviathan Transgenesis technology and defeated certain guardians.
Empires that are not  Machine Intelligence must research higher tiers of robot technologies before they can add some of the more powerful traits to  Mechanical Pops.
Origin traits can only be given by certain empire Origins.

Those advanced traits are made available for genetic modification with the  Genetic Resequencing tradition. Biological ascension traits are only half as likely as standard traits to be inherited by hybrid species. TheExotic Metabolism trait also requires the  Toxoids DLC.
Special traits that cost trait points can be removed via the  Genetic Resequencing tradition. Special traits that do not cost trait points have a fixed chance of being inherited by hybrid species.
Pre-Sapient species have exclusive traits that cannot otherwise be chosen when creating or modifying a species. They retain these traits after being uplifted as a sapient species and do not cost any trait points.

All robot species have either the  Mechanical or the  Machine trait.  Mechanical Pops can exist within  Machine Intelligence empires via conquest but  Machine Pops cannot exist outside  Machine Intelligence empires. All such species can then be given new traits through Robomodding once the  Machine Template System technology is researched, a few of them being restricted to  Mechanical or  Machine species. Robotic traits can be both positive and negative, which are mutually exclusive with each other, and both of them can be added and removed at will once the technology to enable Robomodding becomes available.
TheHive-Minded trait can only be added by hive mind empires and can only be removed by empires that are not hive minds. Pops with this trait in an non-Hive Mind empire will slowly die while pops without the Hive-Minded trait in a Hive Mind empire can only be displaced, purged or used as livestock.
Traits are mostly fixed at the start of the game. Altering traits during the game is generally possible only later in the game through some select events or by using genetic engineering. Certain  Biology (for Biological species) and  Industry (for Robotic species) technologies and Ascension Perks add additional  Trait Points that can be used to alter all or some of a species'  Pops; modifications can range from altering their planet  Habitability to adding an additional positive trait or removing a negative one.
Can be employed in Servant jobs if under AI Servitude
Cannot be employed in Ruler, Specialist or Complex Drone jobs
Replaces half of the Food or Minerals upkeep with Energy
Initial traits are available when first creating a species. They can all be changed later via genetic modification. Initial traits can be both positive and negative, with the two being mutually exclusive. Traits that affect  Happiness cannot be added to species with the  Hive-Minded trait.
The  Adaptive and  Rapid Breeders traits are not normally available to species with the  Lithoid trait but can be added with the  Genetic Resequencing tradition.
Some traits affect how strongly a pop isattracted to certain factions.
Overtuned traits can only be added or removed by empires with the  Overtuned origin. Empires with the  Genetic Resequencing tradition can also remove them. Overtuned traits provide bonuses similar to initial traits for less points but also reduce leader lifespan.
Each organic species has a climate preference trait that determines their base  Habitability on the various types of planets, usually that corresponding to the type of their homeworld. Habitability traits can be changed through genetic modification, but a pop can never have more than one Habitability trait. The Habitability of other celestial body types is unaffected by these traits.
