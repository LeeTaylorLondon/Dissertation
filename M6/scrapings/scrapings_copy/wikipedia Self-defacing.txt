’Self-deprecation’ is more properly ‘self-depreciation’, since the former (from Latin precari prayer) means ‘to pray against oneself’ and the latter (from Latin precium value) means to devalue oneself.

Engaging in self deprecation allows individuals to appear more likable by showing off their flaws and deflecting praise.[9]People tend to have more negative impressions of individuals who seem boastful and who talk positively about themselves. They are often perceived as arrogant, but this doesn't occur when one describes themselves in a negative way.[9] A person might self-deprecate after achieving something in fear of their accomplishment threatening the self-concept of others. People with higher statuses (i.e., is wealthy, has many accomplishments, are physically attractive) are perceived more positively if they self-deprecate by highlighting their own personal flaws and downplay their successes.[9]
In traditional British-English culture, self-deprecation is considered to be an element of modesty. Modesty is considered a virtue, often contrasted to the North American demonstration of self-confidence, often taken for boasting.[10] This is characteristic such as in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, where "blowing one's own trumpet" is frowned upon.[11] In stereotypical English behavior, belittling themselves means appearing polite by putting someone else first.[10]

Self-deprecation, or self-depreciation, is the act of reprimanding oneself by belittling, undervaluing, disparaging oneself,[1] or being excessively modest.[2][3] It can be used as a way to make complaints, express modesty, invoke optimal reactions or add humour. It may also be used as a way for individuals to appear more likable and agreeable.[4]Self-deprecation often reflects low self-esteem and is associated with depression and anxiety and has become increasingly popular on social media, especially among Gen Z.[5]

Boasting on social media, just like in real life, is often perceived negatively and is another reason why users gravitate towards self-deprecation to appear more likable.[9]People also tend to like a person more if positive information about them is presented by a third party rather than from themselves, even if it is the same information. Furthermore, using self-deprecating hash tags allows individuals to be perceived as less arrogant and more humorous.[9]

Social media can be public yet personal and has norms most users follow to avoid being criticized.These types of self-deprecating jokes can let people feel free from the pressure of needing to appear perfect. It lets users display their less-desirable traits or habits while preventing feelings of embarrassment.[19]

Self-deprecation was recommended by philosophers of Stoicism as a response to insults. Instead of getting defensive, people should join in by insulting themselves even more. According to the Stoics, this will remove the sting from the insult. It will also disappoint the interlocutor because the person failed to show upset in response to words that were supposed to hurt them, thereby reducing the chance that they will try to upset the person like that again.[6] People prefer self-criticism over being criticized by others.[7]
However, researchers believe it can have an overall negative effect on users.It can result in them feeling that they don't deserve praise and undermining their own authority.[8]

So there are nations that are do not value self deprecation? Which ones? You should have a source since you claim certain nations i.e. only examples given are European when you have civilizations that have been around for 4-5 000 years and surely must have been somewhat modest (Chinese, Indian, Persian, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, etc.The irony is, when you claim certain nations are excessively modest, you are contradicting yourself by 'blowing their trumpet' for them when they in fact trying to avoid this and that is the whole point.— Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.79.143.139 (talk) 01:22, 19 May 2015 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Cyberbot II has detected that page contains external links that have either been globally or locally blacklisted.Links tend to be blacklisted because they have a history of being spammed, or are highly innappropriate for Wikipedia.This, however, doesn't necessarily mean it's spam, or not a good link.If the link is a good link, you may wish to request whitelisting by going to the request page for whitelisting.If you feel the link being caught by the blacklist is a false positive, or no longer needed on the blacklist, you may request the regex be removed or altered at the blacklist request page.If the link is blacklisted globally and you feel the above applies you may request to whitelist it using the before mentioned request page, or request it's removal, or alteration, at the request page on meta.When requesting whitelisting, be sure to supply the link to be whitelisted and wrap the link in nowiki tags.The whitelisting process can take its time so once a request has been filled out, you may set the invisible parameter on the tag to true.Please be aware that the bot will replace removed tags, and will remove misplaced tags regularly.
I believe you are misrepresenting Wikipedia:NOTDICDEF. A dictionary entry is no more prescriptive than a mathematics entry that explains the limits of a theorem's applicability: so the article would still be descriptive. Second, the subject of this article is still the actual humor, not about the correct word for it. But I learned recently that self-deprecating outnumbers self-depreciating 50:1. Self-depreciating is still more correct--and deserves mention--but self-deprecating seems to have permanently invaded on the other's meaning.—Preceding unsigned comment added by 97.116.0.248 (talk) 22:28, 24 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Self-deprecation is often perceived as being a characteristic of certain nations, such as Great Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, where "blowing one's own trumpet" is frowned upon.
Self-deprecating humor purports to be self critical, but sometimes the "negative" that is pointed out is not so negative. For example "oh, my skin is so white I can't get a tan", in a culture where whiteness is generally seen to confer status is an example of self-deprecating humor that is not (to borrow a term from above) self-depreciating. 71.190.66.244 (talk) 19:10, 24 April 2010 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Someone changed this article to "self depreciation".I see now it has been (rightfully) changed back.But to clear this up for anyone who may have had any doubts, I want to reiterate: Self deprecation is the common term.The only Google results I could find for self "depreciation" are about some kind of psychological condition, and a few message board posts where people apparently meant to type "deprecation".See also the Google Fight link for this.71.35.143.8 (talk) 15:29, 23 July 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
As self-deprecation does not seem to simply be a form of comedy, perhaps it would be productive to split the pages as this subject amasses more content, adding a header similar to the one on the Hmannan Yazawin page.

See Self-deprecation (Psychology) for an article about the general psychological term."I am not at all an expert in comedy, so I will leave the details to such experts.98.81.1.151 (talk) 00:42, 19 August 2013 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Somebody has unilaterally merged the articles Self-deprecation and Self-hatred improperly, without following the standard Wikipedia WP:MERGE protocol for open discussion before a proposed merge. The Self-deprecation article appears to have been truncated and stuffed into a sub-subsection of the Self-hatred article.

Both are basically synonymous, the former being simply a $20 word and the latter one in a 5-cent-word. For example, many discussions of the "self-hating Jew" stereotype use the term "self-deprecation".

Based on the definitions of these words, self-deprecating should be the mental condition since it means "self-hate" and self-depreciating should be the type of humor in which you belittle yourself. Historical usage also confirms this. Until the late 19th century self-depreciating was the standard form. dictionary.com actually has a usage note that explains the mistaken origins of self-deprecation. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia should adhere to the most correct English, even if common usage had distorted the meaning of self-deprecation.—Preceding unsigned comment added by 97.116.0.248 (talk) 18:52, 16 August 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
