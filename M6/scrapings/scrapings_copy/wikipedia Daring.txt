The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Daring had a single 3-inch (76.2 mm) QF gun between her funnels and two 40-millimetre (1.6 in) QF 2-pounder Mk II guns mounted on the side of her bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes.[2] One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.[3]
In December 1934 she sailed to join the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in the Far East and served there until the outbreak of war. Upon the ship's arrival at Singapore, Lord Mountbatten was transferred to command HMS Wishart and Commander Geoffrey Barnard assumed command.[6][7]

HMS Daring was a D-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship spent the bulk of her career on the China Station. She was briefly commanded by Louis Mountbatten before World War II. Daring escorted convoys in the Red Sea in October–November 1939 and then returned to the UK in January 1940 for the first time in five years. While escorting a convoy from Norway, she was sunk by the German submarine U-23 in February 1940.
The ship and her sisters Duncan, Diana, and Dainty were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet shortly before World War II began in September 1939. Daring was kept in the Red Sea for escort and patrol work until November 1939. She was overhauled in Malta from 25 November to 20 December. The ship escorted the Union-Castle Line ocean liner SS Dunnottar Castle to Belfast in early 1940 and was under repair at Portsmouth until 25 January. Daring joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in Scapa Flow on 10 February 1940 for escort duties. While escorting Convoy HN12 from Norway, she was torpedoed on 18 February in position .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap}58°39′N 01°40′W﻿ / ﻿58.650°N 1.667°W﻿ / 58.650; -1.667Coordinates: 58°39′N 01°40′W﻿ / ﻿58.650°N 1.667°W﻿ / 58.650; -1.667 by U-23, under the command of Otto Kretschmer. Daring capsized and sank very quickly after having her stern blown off; 157 of the ship's company were lost. The five survivors were rescued by the submarine HMS Thistle, which had witnessed the attack.[8]

Daring was ordered on 2 February 1931 under the 1930 Naval Estimates, and was laid down at John I Thornycroft's yard at Woolston, Southampton on 18 June 1931. She was launched on 7 April 1932 and completed on 25 November 1932, at a total cost of £225,536, excluding equipment supplied by the Admiralty, such as weapons, ammunition and wireless equipment. The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September–October 1933.[4] Lord Louis Mountbatten assumed command on 29 April 1934,[5] and Daring was given a refit at Sheerness Dockyard from 3 September to 24 October to prepare the ship for service on the China Station.[6]

Daring displaced 1,375 long tons (1,397 t) at standard load and 1,890 long tons (1,920 t) at deep load. The ship had an overall length of 329 feet (100.3 m), a beam of 33 feet (10.1 m) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches (3.8 m). She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of 36,000 shaft horsepower (27,000 kW) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph). Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. Daring carried a maximum of 473 long tons (481 t) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5,870 nautical miles (10,870 km; 6,760 mi) at 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). The ship's complement was 145 officers and men.[1]

The first Darings were designed by Arthur Robb,[2] based on his 5.5 Metre yacht Vision which was built for and won silver in the 1956 Olympics. 35 yachts of the class were built in the years up to 1992. In 2008 a new hull mould was commissioned to match the original lines but with a redesigned ergonomic deck and cockpit. One new yacht was built and several more obtained new hulls while keeping the original name, number, rigging and keel.

The Class Association has a number of strong affiliations, including with the International One Design fleet. This provides for the winner of Cowes Week each year to compete at Bermuda International Invitational Race Week in IODs. Further the class has links with foreign yacht clubs which will annually compete a team racing challenge in home or foreign waters. Competitors in the past have included the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club, the Royal Freshwater Bay Yacht Club in Perth, Western Australia and the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club on Long Island, USA.
The season runs for approximately 80 races from April through to October, with highlights including Cowes Classics Week and Cowes Week in June and August. The Daring Class Association manages the class rules carefully to ensure affordability, uniformity and close racing. The class is not often raced against other designs of yachts, as the class racing is usually competitive and well attended, however occasionally pursuit races are competed with other classes of yacht in the Solent.
To date all Darings are based in Cowes apart from three (8, Day Dreamer; 18, Deva; 20, Afroessa) sold to owners in Beirut, Cumbria and Majorca respectively. Most Darings' names begin with "D".

The Daring is a One-Design keelboat which is based in Cowes on the Isle of Wight and races throughout the season around the Solent. Its construction is GRP, with some older yachts possessing original wooden decks.
