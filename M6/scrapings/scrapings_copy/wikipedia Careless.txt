He happily tells his sister, Amalia (Betsy Blair), with whom he lives, of the encounter. She tells him not to do anything stupid, and asks if the lady is honest.
A colleague drops hints that Angiolina may not be quite the "little angel" that her name suggests. Photos in her home also suggest that she has known a number of men previously. Progressive observations of Angiolina, around Trieste, reveal her with multiple men.
He meets the younger Angiolina (Claudia Cardinale), a beautiful and vivacious lady, whom he perceives as free and innocent. He will educate her in the ways of the world and reduce her naivety.
Meanwhile, his sister Amalia develops an infatuation with the talented Stefano. When Emilio stops Stefano from seeing her any more, it leads to tragic consequences...

Rachel Slater in Australian Women's Book Review noted: "Death and grief are central to this novel, and in particular the concept of public versus private grief and the questions around how art can deal with a subject of such magnitude...Careless offers an intimate yet shared portrayal of grief in all its complexities and reminds us that our promises of care can never really be kept."[3]

In survey data, careless responses are those that are defined to have not been entirely authentic or to be lacking in relevance to the topic being examined in the study. Also referred to as random response, this is an area of concern in research studies and data collection due to the possible impacts that error data could have on the significance conclusion to be drawn later. Attention and interest are both factors that have a possible influence on the validity of an individual's responses. Careless data can lead to lower reliability which will ultimately decrease the intensity of correlation, if one exists.A method known as data screening is recommended as a means of discerning between response data that is valid and that which is careless.[8]

Data is information or evidence that is gathered from an environment or sample to be processed and interpreted to find and provide results for a particular study. Research data has an important role in the field of psychology, providing insight to be analyzed, shared, and stored for future reference.[6]

Carelessness has been hypothesized to be one possible cause of accident-proneness.
Particularly, survey data collection refers to the gathering of information from subjects in a sample by empirical research methods in order to attain a comprehensive examination of a situation or specific study from the individuals. The validity of the a responses of the subjects in the sample is important, as they provide the basis for which a conclusion can be drawn in that study.[7]
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that is known to impact performance in school due to the culmination of its symptoms of exhibiting abnormalities in their levels of attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.[4] The concern regarding students making careless mistakes in school being driven in the direction of ADHD, without any other logical explanation, is not entirely invalid. In addition, making careless mistakes is a symptom of ADHD that is commonly studied. Although largely studied for its prevalence in children and adolescents, there is still limited knowledge about the origin of the disorder.[5]

Carelessness refers to the lack of awareness during a behaviour that can result in unintended consequences. The consequences way of carelessness are often undesirable and tend to be mistakes.[1] A lack of concern or an indifference for the consequences of the action due to inattention may partake in the origin of carelessness.[2]

In any education environment, careless mistakes are those errors that occur in areas within which the student has had training. Careless mistakes are common occurrences for students both within and outside of the learning environment. They are often associated with a lapse in judgment or what are known as mind slips because the students had know-how to have avoided making the mistakes, but did not for undeterminable reasons. Given that students that are competent of the subject and focused are most likely to make careless mistakes,[3] concerns for students exhibiting careless mistakes often turn toward neurological disorders as the cause.
