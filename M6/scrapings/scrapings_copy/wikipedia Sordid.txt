Despite their limited success, Sordid Humor's music has survived in the choices of college DJs. They are notable for bringing together three musicians of Counting Crows: Adam Duritz, who sang backing vocals on "Barbarossa" and several other tracks on Light Music, David Immerglück, who played bass on several tracks of the album, and David Bryson who produced several of their tracks. Duritz would later incorporate lyrics from Sordid Humor songs"Private Archipelago", "Doris Day", and "Jumping Jesus" in Counting Crows performances, and Counting Crows would include a cover of "Jumping Jesus" on their album Underwater Sunshine.
Marty Jones also played bass on "Light Music".He is the namesake for the Counting Crows song "Mr. Jones".

Barnes' unique vocal style and unusual phrasing was the trademark of Sordid Humor, and he went on to lend his vocals and alt-rock guitar style to Engine 88, and a solo project called the Blimp. Sordid Humor played a textured rock with layers of guitars and vocals that, at the time, could best be classified as college rock, releasing several independent releases before breaking up in 1992.
