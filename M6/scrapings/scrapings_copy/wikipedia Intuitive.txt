Unlike most diets, intuitive eating does not try to ban or restrict certain foods, with its mindset being that food should not be looked at as “good or bad.” Practitioners are instead encouraged to listen to their body and eat what feels right for them.[6]
A review found that intuitive eating correlated with self-esteem and self-compassion.[4]

The term "intuitive eating," coined by registered dietitians Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch, first appeared in a 1990's peer reviewed journal article.[5] In 2012, Tribole's and Resch's book "Intuitive Eating a Revolutionary Program that Works" was published, identifying the ten components of intuitive eating and displaying the scientific research that has been conducted on the diet as of far.[1]
Intuitive eating may be equally effective as a diabetes self-management education (DSME) and a lifestyle weight loss program, although further research is needed.[7]

Intuitive eating is a weight-neutral approach to diet in which a person eats in response to cues of hunger and satisfaction.[2][3] Focusing on "weight control" is discouraged with this approach.[4] Additionally, intuitive eating aims at changing users' views about what they know about diet (notably, canceling toxic diet culture), health, and wellness, looking at these elements through a more holistic approach.[1] And, intuitive eating helps to create a positive attitude and relationship towards food, physical activity, and the body.[4]
Additionally, registered dietitians comment that those who have certain health conditions, may be prescribed by their doctor to follow a particular diet, eliminating the choice to follow an intuitive eating diet. Critics of the diet have also stated that because intuitive eating is so broad with no given diet plan/food restrictions, it can be hard for some, not knowing what to actually eat and how much to eat- it can be a steep learning curve to accurately respond to one's hunger and fullness cues.[11]

A 2022 review found that intuitive eating helped to decrease dieting and concerns about weight.[3]
Intuitive eating has been shown to be equally effective to diet intervention for short-term weight loss, and to decrease weight significantly more than in control groups that had no diet intervention.[5] Long-term weight loss from intuitive eating might be possible, but this possibility is not yet well-studied.[5]
According to Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch’s book “Intuitive Eating a Revolutionary Program that Works", intuitive eating follows 10 guidelines.[3][1] These guidelines are to reject the diet mentality, honor your hunger, make peace with food, challenge to food police, feel your fullness, discover the satisfaction factor, cope with your emotions without using food, respect your body, exercise, and honor your health.

A 2019 study revealed that women who followed intuitive eating patterns were able to let go of the concept of "good" and "bad" foods that are commonly promoted by diet culture, allowing them to eat a more balanced, sustainable, and non-restrictive diet.[9]

Intuitive eating has shown growth as a possible method for losing weight and yielding health benefits. However, researchers warn that there still is not enough sufficient researched evidence to support that intuitive eating can assist with weight loss long-term, or even maintain lost weight. Furthermore, doctors and registered dietitians warn that this 'non-diet' diet approach will yield different results for different people who choose to follow this method of eating- no two bodies are the same and will react the same to this diet.[10]
In overweight or obese pregnant women, intuitive eating can also help lower glucose levels.[7]

At that point Freund, Moll, and Robert Younge (also from Acuson) wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital.Early investors included the Mayfield Fund, Sierra Ventures, and Morgan Stanley.[citation needed]
The company refined the SRI System into a prototype known originally as "Lenny" (after the young Leonardo da Vinci), which was ready for testing in 1997. As the company's prototypes became more advanced, they were named using da Vinci themes. One was named "Leonardo", and another was "Mona". The final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da Vinci Surgical System, and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized. After further testing, Intuitive Surgical began marketing this system in Europe in 1999, while awaiting FDA approval in the United States.[citation needed][4]
The company raised $46 million in an initial public offering in 2000.That same year, the FDA approved use of the da Vinci Surgical System for general laparoscopic surgery, which can be used to address gallbladder disease and gastroesophageal disease.In 2001, the FDA approved use of the system for prostate surgery.The FDA has subsequently approved the system for thoracoscopic surgery, cardiac procedures performed with adjunctive incisions, and gynecologic procedures.[5]
In June 2018, Intuitive Surgical settled class action lawsuits against it for a payment of $43 million.[15][16]

For the fiscal year 2017, Intuitive Surgical reported earnings of US$660 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.129 billion, an increase of 15.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Intuitive Surgical's shares traded at over $307 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$58 billion in November 2018.[9]
The initiative was followed up by a wave of similar class-action lawsuits shortly afterwards, including those filed by Kaleida Health and Franciscan Health.[17][18]

In 1994, Dr. Frederic Moll became interested in the SRI System, as the device was known at the time. At the time, Moll was employed by Guidant. He tried to interest Guidant in backing it but to no avail. In 1995 Moll was introduced to John Freund who had recently left Acuson Corporation. Freund negotiated an option to acquire SRI's intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named Intuitive Surgical Devices, Inc.
Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is an American corporation that develops, manufactures, and markets robotic products designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients through minimally invasive surgery, most notably with the da Vinci Surgical System.The company is part of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500. As of 31 December 2021[update], Intuitive Surgical had an installed base of 6,730 da Vinci Surgical Systems, including 4,139 in the U.S., 1,199 in Europe, 1,050 in Asia, and 342 in the rest of the world.[2]
The da Vinci Surgical System is a robotic surgical system. The system is controlled by a surgeon from a console. It is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures.[12][13]

Shortly before going public, Intuitive Surgical was sued for patent infringement by Computer Motion, Inc, its chief rival.Computer Motion had actually gotten into the robotic surgery field earlier than Intuitive Surgical, with its own system, the ZEUS Robotic Surgical System.Although the ZEUS system was approved in Europe, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved it for any procedure at the time that the FDA first approved the da Vinci system.The uncertainty created by the litigation between the companies was a drag on each company's growth. In 2003, Intuitive Surgical and Computer Motion agreed to merge, thus ending the litigation between them.[6]The ZEUS system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da Vinci system. Computer Motion was led by Chairman Robert Duggan from 1990 until 2003, when the two companies merged.[7]

Before the buyout of Computer Motion, the stock of Intuitive was selling at around $14 per share, adjusted for stock splits. After the merger, the stock price rose significantly (and by 2015 it was at about $500),[8] primarily because of the growth in systems sold (60 in 2002 compared with 431 in 2014) and the number of surgical procedures performed (less than 1,000 in 2002 compared with 540,000 in 2014).[citation needed]

The research that eventually led to the development of the da Vinci Surgical System was performed in the late 1980s at a non-profit research institute SRI International.[3]In 1990, SRI received funding from the National Institutes of Health.SRI developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield.

A da Vinci Surgical System costs approximately $1.5 million.[14] The new da Vinci SI released in April 2009 cost about $1.75 million. In addition, there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery. In 2008, The New York Times reported that most hospitals and clinics have a hard time recovering the cost of the robot.[13]

In 2021, Intuitive was sued for alleged abuse of its monopolist position. Specifically, replacement part manufacturer Rebotix Repair accused Intuitive of anticompetitive behaviour in the robots' aftermarket business and overcharging of hospitals for replacement parts.[citation needed]

Making a formal medical diagnosis is not a practice for many medical intuitives.[citation needed] In a few cases medical intuitives have been hired by hospitals, clinics and medical offices, particularly in California.[4] Many medical professionals and psychologists attribute perceived anecdotal successes by medical intuitives to a combination of wishful thinking, confirmation bias, the placebo effect, and regression fallacy associated with self-limiting conditions.[5][6]

A medical intuitive is an alternative medicine practitioner who claims to be able to use their intuitive abilities to find the cause of a physical or emotional condition through the use of insight rather than modern medicine.[1] Other terms for such a person include medical clairvoyant or medical psychic.
McCartney, Francesca (2005), Body of Health: the new science of intuition medicine for energy & balance, New World Library, p. 23m.
In 2009 Steven Novella, writing on Science Based Medicine, calls medical intuitive diagnosis as "purely magical thinking" and refers to a Huffington Post article about it as "a promotion of a dubious pseudoscientific medical claim".[8]

A few educational institutions offer graduate degrees that include "research-based training" and certifications for medical intuitives.[4] Other medical intuitives may be licensed medical professionals and their ability to accurately diagnose diseases and heal may not be supported by scientific evidence.[7]

The practice of claiming to use intuition or clairvoyance for medical information dates back to Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802–1866), whose intuitive healing practice began in 1854. Edgar Cayce (1877–1945) was known as one of the most well known medical clairvoyants.[2] William M. Branham, the father of the Pentecostal Latter Rain Movement, was said by his followers to be able to discern the health condition of people that attended his services, and in many cases heal them of their affliction.[3]
