This calculator is for determining the percent increase from the Biting, Precise, and Equilibrium perks; in addition, Erethdor's grimoire is included due to its similarity with the Biting perk. Only ability damage range percents are taken into consideration.

The Precise perk now has an increased minimum damage of 1.5% per rank of your maximum damage, up from 1%.

These combinations give approximately 1% more damage than a common Precise 5 or Precise 3 and Equilibrium 2 gizmos.

As such, Precise increases the ability damage of abilities with a 1:5 ratio as follows:
(there exists a combination with chance≥12000){\displaystyle \left({\text{there exists a combination with chance}}\geq {\frac {1}{2000}}\right)}
The table below lists the average hit increase of abilities that have a different ratio of ability damage.

An ideal weapon gizmo for off-hand and two-handed weapons contains one of the following perk combinations:
Many sources of damage (such as bleeds, poison, Aftershock, Summoning familiars, and Crackling) are unaffected by Biting, Precise, Equilibrium, and Erethdor's grimoire. For that reason, the damage increases shown in this calculator will likely be higher than the overall damage increase seen during combat.

Most abilities' minimum hits are 20% of their maximum hit, but some abilities also mention minimum hits. The minimum and maximum hit numbers can be changed, but leaving them between 20% and 100% gives correct damage increase numbers for most abilities.

The table above applies to abilities with a damage range of 20%–100%, excluding Dismember. The average hit of abilities which cause bleeds are calculated with a different formula; furthermore they are unaffected by the damage increase of Invention perks.

The suggested combination for P4E2 is 5 Precise components. For P5E1, use 2 Precise components and 3 Armadyl component. Since these gizmos are very rare (and thus expensive), it is recommended to attain level 120 Invention and to drink an extreme invention potion (or super invention for players with lower Herblore) before attempting them. As the damage increase is small, it may be more cost effective to improve gear in other areas before pursuing these combination gizmos.
The suggested combination for P6E2 is 5 Precise components and 4 Armadyl components. For P6AS1, use 7 Armadyl components and 2 Ilujankan components. For P6R1, use 7 Armadyl components and 2 Timeworn components. For P6Geno, use 9 Historic components. Since these gizmos are very rare (and thus expensive), it is recommended to attain level 120 Invention and to drink an extreme invention potion (or super invention for players with lower Herblore) before attempting them. As the damage increase is small, it may be more cost effective to improve gear in other areas before pursuing these combination gizmos.
Typically, abilities have ability damage ranges from 20% to 100%; this can be represented as a ratio 1:5. As an example, Havoc's ability damage range is 25–125%; this can be calculated as 20–100%, as the percentage range ratio is 1:5.
P4E2 is slightly better than P5E1 for Magic due to four-tick auto attacks.
An ideal ancient weapon gizmo for off-hand and two-handed weapons contains one of the following perk combinations:

Precise is an perk for Invention that increases the minimum hit of abilities and auto attacks by a percentage of its maximum hit. It can be created in weapon gizmos. Damage-over-time abilities are not affected by Precise.
