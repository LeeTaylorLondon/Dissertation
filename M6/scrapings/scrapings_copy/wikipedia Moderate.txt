Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) is formed by a group of politicians who splintered off of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) in 1960. The party advocated a moderate social-democratic politics and supported the U.S.-Japan Alliance.[5] The party supported neoliberalism from the 1980s, and was disbanded in 1994.[6]

Moderates social-democrats of the JSP formed the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) with conservative-liberal Sakigake and other moderates of the LDP.[7] Most of the DPJ's mainstream factions moved to the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), but the former DPJ's right-wing moved to the Democratic Party for the People after 2019.[8]
In recent years, the term political moderates has gained traction as a buzzword. The existence of the ideal moderate is disputed because of a lack of a moderate political ideology. Voters who describe themselves as centrist often mean that they are moderate in their political views, advocating neither extreme left-wing nor right-wing politics.

Japan's right-wing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has traditionally been divided into two main factions: the based on bureaucratic "conservative mainstream" (保守本流) and the hawkish nationalist "conservative anti-mainstream" (保守傍流). Among them, "conservative mainstream" is also considered a moderate wing within the LDP. The LDP's faction Kōchikai, is considered a moderate wing.[3] The current LDP has conflicts between moderate patriotist and extreme nationalist supporters.[4]

Gallup polling indicated that American voters identified as moderate between 35–38% of the time during the 1990s and 2000s.[9] Voters may identify with moderation for a number of reasons: pragmatic, ideological, or otherwise. It has also been suggested that individuals vote for centrist parties for purely statistical reasons.[10]
Moderate is an ideological category which designates a rejection of radical or extreme views, especially in regard to politics and religion.[1][2] A moderate is considered someone occupying any mainstream position avoiding extreme views. In American politics, a moderate is considered someone occupying a centre position on the left–right political spectrum.

The Moderates were a municipal political organisation operating in Scotland in the early 20th century. The group was based on tacit anti-Labour co-operation between local Unionist Party, Liberal and Independents politicians. The Moderates dominated Glasgow Corporation until the 1933 election, when the rise of the Scottish Protestant League split the Moderate vote and allowed Labour to gain control of the council for the first time.[1]

The Moderates in Glasgow would later become the Progressives in 1936, following the establishment of the Edinburgh Progressive party in 1928. Whilst the terms Progressive and Moderate grew increasingly interchangeable, Even as late as 1969 various Councillors were contesting local elections on a moderate - as opposed to Progressive - platform.
