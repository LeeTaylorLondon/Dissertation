According to 'Winston Spencer Churchill, The Last Lion - Alone' by William Manchester, Walter Lippmann in 1933 writing for the New York Herald tribune wrote quite disturbing things about Hitler.

The article does not mention that Lippmann opposed the Korean war, McCarthyism and the Vietnam war. This puts a different focus on him than the present biography, which paints the picture of an anti-communist, elitist, conservative person. See http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAlippmann.htm
From the article: "Following the removal from office of Henry A. Wallace in September 1946, Lippman became the leading public advocate of the need to respect a Soviet sphere of influence in Europe, in juxtaposition to the containment strategy being advocated at the time by people like George F. Kennan." Containment certainly allowed them their sphere of influence in what became the Warsaw Pact nations. So what were the geographic limits of the sphere of influence proposed by Lippmann? - Jmabel | Talk 00:56, 11 November 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]

As it reads now (June 2021) part of the World War I section says that Lippman joined the Army (and Army intelligence) in June 1918, where he assisted Col. House, and by his connection with Col House was involved in drafting the Fourteen Points, which had been declared, however, the previous January. Presumably, the two established a connection while Lippmann was still a civilian, but this is not made clear in the article. —— Shakescene (talk) 18:06, 23 June 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Throughout the world, in the name of progress, men who call themselves communists, socialists, fascists, nationalists, progressives, and even liberals, are unanimous in holding that government with its instruments of coercion must by commanding the people how they shall live, direct the course of civilization and fix the shape of things to come. . . . The premises of authoritarian collectivism have become the working beliefs, the self-evident assumptions, the unquestioned axioms, not only of all the revolutionary regimes, but of nearly every effort which lays claim to being enlightened, humane, and progressive. So universal is the dominion of this dogma over the minds of contemporary men that no one is taken seriously as a statesman or a theorist who does not come forward with proposals to magnify the power of public officials and to extend and multiply their intervention in human affairs. Unless he is authoritarian and collectivist, he is a mossback, a reactionary, at best an amiable eccentric swimming hopelessly against the tide. It is a strong tide. Though despotism is no novelty in human affairs, it is probably true that at no time in twenty-five hundred years has any western government claimed for itself a jurisdiction over men's lives comparable with that which is officially attempted in totalitarian states. But it is even more significant that in other lands where men shrink from the ruthless policy of these regimes, it is commonly assumed that the movement of events must be in the same direction. Nearly everywhere the mark of a progressive is that he relies at last upon the increased power of officials to improve the condition of men.

Quote:Lippmann had wide access to the nation's decision makers and had no sympathy for communism. But the Golos spy ring used Mary Price, his secretary, to garner information on items Lippmann chose not to write about or names of Lippmann's sources, often not carried in stories, but of use to the Soviet Ministry for State Security. He examined the coverage of newspapers and saw many inaccuracies and other problems. ... this paragraph makes no sense to me (e. g. I don't find the facts that he was an anticommunist and spied upon by the Russians incompatible, or why they wanted to spy on him for examining newspaper coverage), maybe someone could improve it.

The paragraph I have deleted cannot be seen as adherent to Wikipedian standards. It is phrased with evident personal contempt instead of Wikipedian neutrality. It is entirely dependent on a single source which is, if anything, even more vitriolic and cannot be assessed as meeting normal academic standards.

Lippmann's views as a very young man can be characterized as liberal.He was involved in a number of socialist activities during his college years, but his views changed rather dramatically and fairly quickly.It's certainly fair, I think, to characterize him as elitist.But his subsequent disillusion with and distrust of "the common man" are pretty clearly precursors of Straussianism, especially as it relates to "esoteric knowledge"".

Can the photo really be from "about 1920"? If so, Lippmann should be in his early thirties, which seems implausible.

If Lippmann is seen as a founder of the concept of 'liberal democracy', how can his work also be described as thr basis of contemporary US neoconservatism? It ssems like somewhat of a contradiction. He could have been an elitist as well as a liberal, no?

Thirteen years after solving that last case, the former detectives have drifted apart and lead broken lives, haunted by the memories of the night they spent in the mansion on the lake: budding genius Kerri is an alcoholic tormented by nightmares and has been unable to finish her schooling; nerd Nate is regularly checking himself into mental institutions; tomboy Andy is a vagrant wanted in several states and dealing with aggressive behavior; and golden boy Peter went on to become a successful Hollywood actor whose career was cut short by suicide. Andy has traced all of their problems back to that last case, believing that there was more to it than just a guy in a costume. When the man they exposed as the Sleepy Lake monster makes parole, she assaults him only to confirm that there was something more to the case. Andy then sets off to reunite the surviving members of the gang (including Tim, a Weimaraner descended from the original canine member of the team and Peter as a hallucination that only Nate can see and hear), and together they return to the town of Blyton Hills to solve the case for good.
The title references a catchphrase from the Scooby-Doo series. At the climax, when the heroes have caught the villain and exposed his plot, the villain would often say "And I'd have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for those meddling kids!"

Jason Sheehan from NPR qualified it as "a brilliant idea wedded to beautiful and perfectly-pitched execution."[13] Brian Truitt of USA Today gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it "as cleverly witty as its title...filled with high jinks both terrorizing and hilarious."[6] Sam Reader in their review for Barnes & Noble's Sci-fi and Fantasy Blog praised the depth of the story, saying that the novel "isn't really about the mystery (though it's a good one), but the characters investigating it...These characters may be running through a plot that sounds like a parody, but they are anything but caricatures. When they finally do get closure, it means almost as much (if not more) than solving the mystery."[14]

Cantero first pitched the idea to his editors at Doubleday in 2014 as "Enid Blyton meets Lovecraft". When they did not recognize Blyton's name, he changed that reference to the Scooby Gang.[1][2][3] Although the members of the Blyton Summer Detective Club are based in stereotypes present in many children detective series (the team composition of two boys, two girls, and a dog fits both Blyton's The Famous Five series and Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?), the protagonist, Andy Rodriguez, a butch Latina lesbian, was still modeled after George, the tomboy from the Famous Five.[1] Nancy Drew, Trixie Belden, and the Hardy Boys are also referenced in different ways.[4]

Some stylistic choices divided critics: While Publishers Weekly praised the prose as "fast and funny"[15] and NPR said that the language tricks "would be maddening if they weren't so much fun",[13] Christian Bone of Starburst thought that "Cantero's chosen prose style may prove contentious" and that "some might think it suits the playful tone of the story, but it can also be distracting and take you out of the narrative."[16] James Floyd Kelly of Geek Dad warned that the novel was "not for kids: definitely rated R for language, sexual situations, and horror/violence."[17]

A scene set in a psychiatric hospital features a brief appearance by A. Z. Kimrean, the lead in Cantero's following novel, This Body's Not Big Enough for Both of Us. The latter novel was already written, but unpublished, in Spanish while Cantero was writing Meddling Kids.[3][7] A bonus scene at the end of the paperback edition shows Kimrean arriving in San Francisco, where This Body's Not Big Enough for Both of Us takes place.[8]

Meddling Kids received mostly positive reviews, with critics drawing comparisons with Buffy the Vampire Slayer[9] and "1980s-centric projects" like Stranger Things or Stephen King's It.[10][11][12]
