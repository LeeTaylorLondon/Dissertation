Imagination is the ability to form images of things or events in one's mind. When someone imagines something, they are trying to picture something in their mind that they are not experiencing at the moment or that is not really happening.

Islamic philosophy is the imaginal realm known as Alam al-Mithal, the imaginal world. According to Avicenna, the imagination mediated between, and thus unified, human reason and divine being.This mediating quality manifested in two directions: on the one hand, reason, rising above itself, could attain to the level of active imagination, an activity shared with the lower divine beings.On the other hand, to manifest the concrete forms of the world, divinity created a range of intermediate beings, the angelic co-creators of the universe.[14]: 11  According to philosophers of this tradition, the trained imagination can access a "nonspatial fabric" which mediates between the empirical/sensory and the cognitional/spiritual realms.[15]
Through Averroes, mainstream Islamic philosophy lost its relationship to the active imagination. The Sufi movement, as exemplified by Ibn Arabi, continued to explore contemplative approaches to the imaginal realm.[14]
Henry Corbin considered imaginal cognition to be a "purely spiritual faculty independent of the physical organism and thus surviving it".[16] Islamic philosophy in general, and Avicenna and Corbin in particular, distinguish sharply between the true imaginations that stem from the imaginal realm, and personal fantasies, which have a fictional character and are "imaginary" in the common sense of this word. Corbin termed the imagination, which transcended fantasy imaginatio vera.
For Jung, however, this technique had the potential to allow communication between the conscious and unconscious aspects of the personal psyche with its various components and inter-dynamics and between the personal and "collective" unconscious; and therefore was to be embarked upon with due care and attentiveness.Indeed, he warned with respect to "'active imagination' ... The method is not entirely without danger, because it may carry the patient too far away from reality".[8] The post-Jungian Michael Fordham was to go further, suggesting that "active imagination, as a transitional phenomenon ... can be, and often is, both in adults and children put to nefarious purposes and promotes psychopathology. This probably takes place when the mother's impingements have distorted the 'cultural' elements in maturation, and therefore it becomes necessary to analyze childhood and infancy if the distortion is to be shown up."[9]
An active imagination is a conscious method of experimentation. It employs creative imagination as an organ for "perceiving outside your mental boxes." For the first hundred years of active imagination, it was applied primarily by individuals for exploring their sub- and unconscious; hence its value in psycho-therapeutic settings. Until the "inner child" theme in the 1970s, active imagination was most closely associated with C. G. Jung's experiments with himself and with clients emphasizing its therapeutic value. In the 1980s, active imagination found uses in commercial disciplines, for example, architecture and molecular biology (how do those complex molecules fit together?). Where active imagination seeks to perceive what is already present, fantasy intends to create where nothing yet exists.

In partial answer to this critique, James Hillman and Sonu Shamdasani discuss at length the dangers of viewing active imagination solely as an expression of personal content.They propose the technique is easily misunderstood and misdirected when applied to the strictly biographical and should never be used to bridge the personal with the dead.Instead, they suggest, active imagination in Jung's usage was an exposition of the unvoiced influences of the collective unconscious, shedding the terminology of psychology to work directly through mythic images:

As developed by Carl Jung between 1913 and 1916,[3] active imagination is a meditation technique wherein the contents of one's unconscious are translated into images, narratives, or personified as separate entities. It can serve as a bridge between the conscious "ego" and the unconscious.This often includes working with dreams and the creative self via imagination or fantasy. Jung linked active imagination with the processes of alchemy. Both strive for oneness and inter-relatedness from a set of fragmented and dissociated parts.This process found expression for Jung in his Red Book.

The steps following Imagination he termed Inspiration and Intuition. In Inspiration, a meditant clears away all personal content, including even the consciously chosen content of a symbolic form, while maintaining the activity of imagination itself, thus becoming able to perceive the imaginal realm from which this activity stems.In the next step, Intuition, the meditant leverages the connection to the imaginal or angelic realm established via the cognitive imagination while releasing the images mediated via this connection.By ceasing the activity of imaginative consciousness while allowing one's awareness to remain in contact with the archetypal realm, the possibility opens up for an awareness deeper than the imaginal to be conveyed to the open soul by the mediating agents of this realm.[13]

Corbin suggested that by developing our imaginal perception, we can go beyond mere symbolic representations of archetypes to the point where "new senses perceive directly the order of [supersensible] reality".[17]: 81 To accomplish this passage from symbol to reality requires a "transmutation of the being and the spirit"[18] Corbin describes the imaginal realm as "a precise order of reality, corresponding to a precise mode of perception", the "cognitive Imagination" (p. 1).[19] He considered the imaginal realm to be identical with the realm of angels described in many religions, which manifests not only through imaginations but also in people's vocation and destiny.[17]: 96

The imaginal concept was further developed in the Communication Sciences domain. Samuel Mateus (2013) suggested a close link between the imaginary, society, and publicity. The "public imaginal" was named after the dynamic, symbolic, and complex set of diverse and heterogeneous imaginaries that permeate societies.[20]

It was during Advent of the year 1913 – December 12, to be exact – I resolved upon the decisive step.I was sitting at my desk once more, thinking over my fears.Then I let myself drop.Suddenly it was as though the ground literally gave way beneath my feet, and I plunged into the dark depths.[5]

Further describing his early personal experience with an active imagination, Jung describes how desires and fantasies of the unconscious mind naturally rise to become conscious.Once they are recognized-realized by the individual, dreams may become "weaker and less frequent," whereas they may have been quite vivid and recurring beforehand.[6]
Symbols of Transformation (1967, a revision of Psychology of the Unconscious, 1912)
SS: ... In reflecting on himself, he does not come across at rock bottom his own personal biography, but it's an attempt to uncover the quintessentially human.These dialogues are not dialogues with his past, as you're indicating [...] But with the weight of human history. [...] And this task of discrimination is what he spent the rest of his life engaged in.Yes, in some sense what happened to him was wholly particular but, in the other sense, it was universally human and that generates his project of the comparative study of the individuation process.[10]
Coleridge made a distinction between imagination expressing realities of an imaginal realm above our mundane personal existence and "fancy", or fantasy, which respresents the creativity of the artistic soul. For him, "imagination is the condition for cognitive (conscious?) participation in a sacramental universe".[2]

Jung's use of active imagination was one of several techniques defining his distinctive contribution to the practice of psychotherapy in the period 1912–1960.An active imagination is a method for visualizing unconscious issues by letting them act themselves out.Active imagination can be done by visualization (which is how Jung himself did it), which can be considered similar in technique to shamanic journeying.Active imagination can also be done by automatic writing or by artistic activities such as dance, music, painting, sculpting, ceramics, crafts, etc.Jung considered how, "The patient can make himself creatively independent through this method ... by painting himself he gives shape to himself".[7] Doing active imagination permits the thoughtforms of the unconscious, or inner "self", and of the totality of the psyche, to act out whatever messages they are trying to communicate to the conscious mind.

Active imagination removes or highlights traits and characteristics that are often present in the dream. Without a broader perspective, the person working with active imagination may start to see them as their traits.[11] Thus in this continuing effort to stress the importance of what Maslow would come to call the transpersonal, much of Jung's later work was conceived as a comparative historical study of the active imagination and the individuation process in various cultures and epochs, conceived as a normative pattern of human development and the basis of general scientific psychology.
Jung, quoted in Anthony Stevens, Jung (Oxford 1994) p. 109
Hadamard (1954)[21] and Châtelet (1991)[22] suggest that imagination and conceptual experiment play central roles in mathematical creativity. Important scientific discoveries have been made through imaginative cognition, such as Kekulé's famous discovery of the carbon ring structure of benzene through a dream of a snake eating its tail. Other examples include Archimedes, in his bathtub, imagining that his body is nothing but a gourd of water and Einstein imagining himself to be a photon on a horizon of velocities.

The key to active imagination is restraining the conscious waking mind from exerting influence on internal images as they unfold.For example, if a person were recording a spoken visualization of a scene or object from a dream, Jung's approach would ask the practitioner to observe the scene, watch for changes, and report them, rather than consciously filling the stage with one's desired changes.One would then respond genuinely to these changes and report any further changes in the scene.This approach ensures that the unconscious contents express themselves without undue influence from the conscious mind. At the same time, however, Jung was insistent some form of active participation in active imagination was essential: "You yourself must enter into the process with your personal reactions:  ... as if the drama being enacted before your eyes were real".[4]
The theosophy of post-Renaissance Europe embraced imaginal cognition. From Jakob Böhme to Swedenborg, active imagination played a large role in theosophical works. In this tradition, the active imagination serves as an "organ of the soul, thanks to which humanity can establish a cognitive and visionary relationship with an intermediate world".[1]

Corbin (1964) suggests that it is by developing this faculty of cognitive imagination that we can overcome the "divorce between thinking and being" [19]: 4

Rudolf Steiner suggested cultivating imaginative consciousness through meditative contemplation of texts, objects, or images. The resulting imaginal cognition he believed to be an initial step on a path leading from rational consciousness toward ever-deeper spiritual experience.[12]: 302–311

While at Ziff-Davis, Hamling had become familiar with Fantastic Adventures, the fantasy companion to Ziff-Davis's Amazing Stories, and he was a fan of Charles F. Myers' "Toffee" stories, which had appeared in Fantastic Adventures from the late 1940s.These were humorous stories about a man and his beautiful imaginary girlfriend, Toffee,[14] with what sf historian Joe Sanders calls an "exaggerated pose of naughtiness": nakedness was implied but never directly described, and sex was only hinted at.[7]Hamling printed several "Toffee" stories in Imagination,[14] and when he launched Imaginative Tales, he reprinted Shades of Toffee, a book-length story that had appeared in the June 1950 Fantastic Adventures, in the first issue.[15][16][17]The first six issues included novels in the same vein by either Charles Myers or Robert Bloch,[18] and short fiction soon began to appear.[19] With the seventh issue, dated September 1955, Hamling converted Imaginative Tales to more closely resemble Imagination, printing science fiction rather than fantasy.[18]

Frank M. Robinson, a science fiction writer who was friends with Hamling, suggested changing the title from Imaginative Tales to Caravan and printing men's adventure fiction. Hamling knew Hugh Hefner, the publisher of Playboy, and Hefner set up a lunch with Playboy's distributor to talk over the idea. The distributor was unimpressed, and Hamling instead pitched the idea of a magazine that would compete with Playboy.[9] The result was Rogue,[9] which was more profitable than either of Hamling's science fiction titles.[notes 1][9][11]
^ In Robinson's memoir, he recalls the conversation as having taken place after the title change to Space Travel, but he must be mistaken since Rogue's first issue is dated December 1955.[9][10]

By the late 1950s, paperbacks were displacing magazines on newsstands, and there was widespread resistance among dealers to stocking new magazines. A further blow came in 1957 with the collapse of American News Company, the most important US magazine distributor. The resulting disruption spelled the end for many sf titles. Hamling retitled Imaginative Tales to Space Travel with the July 1958 issue, hoping to cash in on public interest in the early years of the space program. There was no impact on sales, though Ashley attributes this to the lack of interest among book dealers in new magazines.[12] At the end of 1958, both the science fiction titles were axed, and Hamling invested the money in Rogue instead.[11]
American science fiction (sf) magazines first appeared in the 1920s with the launch of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. World War II and its attendant paper shortages interrupted the expanding market for the genre, but by the late 1940s, the market had begun to recover again.[2] From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954.[3] One of these new titles was Imagination, launched at the end of 1950 by Raymond Palmer, who had recently left Ziff-Davis, where he had edited Amazing Stories. In September 1950, Ziff-Davis made the decision to move to New York from Chicago, and Palmer quickly sold Imagination to William Hamling, a Ziff-Davis editor who did not want to relocate and who, like Palmer, chose instead to become an independent publisher.[4][5] In 1954, Hamling started a fantasy magazine as a companion to Imagination. He titled it Imaginative Tales; science fiction historian Mike Ashley comments that this was surprisingly late for Hamling to start a second title since it might have been more profitable earlier in the sf magazine boom, which was fading by late 1954.[6]

Non-fiction features appeared once Hamling gave up on the novels-only format: a letter column, editorials, and an sf movie news column, "Scientifilm Marquee", contributed by Forrest Ackerman. With the title change to Space Travel, science articles by Henry Bott and Guenther Schmidt were added.[7]

All 26 issues were digest-sized, edited by William Hamling and published by Hamling's Greenleaf Publishing Company, based in Evanston, Illinois. The schedule was bimonthly and was completely regular. Issues were initially labelled with a number only, and no volume; from the sixth issue this changed to a volume/number format. There were five volumes, all with six issues except the second volume, which had two. The first issue was 160 pages, and all remaining issues were 128 pages. The price was 35 cents throughout the run.[7]
Mike Ashley describes the contents from this point on as "unremarkable space opera";[6] regular contributors included some of the same writers who wrote for Imagination, including Geoff St. Reynard and Dwight V. Swain.[18][7]Hamling obtained stories from Edmond Hamilton, who Sanders considers "the most readable of the novelists",[7] but he also printed Raymond Palmer's "The Metal Emperor"—"a dreadful Shaveristic adventure" according toAshley,[6] and "possibly the worst story published in either of Hamling's magazines", according to Sanders.[7]Henry Slesar's first sale, "The Brat", appeared in the November 1955 issue.[20] Other writers included many authors who had been regular contributors to Amazing Stories—Hamling was familiar with these writers from his time at Ziff-Davis.[18]
When Hamling announced the magazine, in an editorial in Imagination, he said "We actually don't know whether it's a magazine or paperback in magazine form", adding that it would usually carry book-length works.[7] The format of the magazine was initially similar to that of Galaxy Science Fiction Novels, a series of digest-sized novels started in 1950 as a companion to Galaxy Science Fiction.[7][8]
Imaginative Tales was an American fantasy and science fiction magazine launched in September 1954 by William Hamling's Greenleaf Publishing Company. It was created as a sister magazine to Imagination, which Hamling had acquired from Raymond A. Palmer's Clark Publishing.Imaginative Tales began as a vehicle for novel-length humorous fantasy, early issues featuring stories by Charles F. Myers and Robert Bloch.After a year, Hamling switched the focus to science fiction and it became similar in content to Imagination, publishing routine space operas. In 1958, with public interest in space high, Hamling changed the title to Space Travel, but there was little effect on sales.Magazine circulation was suffering because of the rise of the paperback, and the liquidation in 1957 of American News Company, a major magazine distributor, made it even harder for small magazines to survive.Hamling eventually ceased publication of both Imaginative Tales and Imagination in 1958, preferring to invest the money in Rogue, a men's magazine he had started in imitation of Playboy in 1955.
