It is usual for speakers of the House of Commons to be made privy councillors, in which case they keep the style for life. By custom, the leader of the Official Opposition is appointed to the Privy Council, granting them the style (being the only non-government MP accorded such privilege). In the past, certain provincial premiers (e.g., Peter Lougheed, Bill Davis, Joey Smallwood and Tommy Douglas) were elevated to the Privy Council and gained the style, but such practice is rare.

"The Honourable – style or title". Encyclopædia Britannica. Archived from the original on 6 February 2021. Retrieved 4 August 2022. (...) The Heralds' College officially reported on the petition on October 31, 1835, stating (...) that "the style of 'The Honourable' is given to the Judges and to the Barons of the Exchequer, with others; because, by the Decree of the tenth of King James the First, for settling the place and precedency of the Baronets, the Judges, and Barons of the Exchequer, were declared to have place and precedence before the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons."(...) The analogy held only in so far as both styles were applicable to those who belonged to the less exalted ranks of the titled classes, for the title "honourable" was not definitely confined to certain classes until later. The terms honorabilis and honorabilitas were in use in the Middle Ages as a form of politeness rather than as a specific title. More than two centuries later John Selden, in his Titles of Honor (1614), does not include "honourable" among the courtesy titles given to the children of peers.The style was, in fact, used extremely loosely until well on into the 18th century.(...) British baronets, for instance, claimed that they had been styled "the honourable" until the end of the 18th century, and in 1835 they petitioned for the style as a prefix to their names. The Heralds' College officially reported on the petition on October 31, 1835, stating that the presented evidence did not prove the right of baronets to the style and that its use "has been no more warranted by authority than when the same style has been applied to Field Officers in the Army and others.".(...) It is not, indeed, until 1874 that there is any clear evidence of an authoritative limitation of the title. In this year the wives of Lords of Appeal were granted style and precedence as baronesses, but it was provided that their children were not "to assume or use the prefix of Honourable, or to be entitled to the style, rank or precedence of the children of a Baron." In 1898, however, this was revoked, and it was ordained "that such children shall have and enjoy on all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of hereditary Barons together with the rank and precedence." By these acts of the Crown, the prefix "honourable" would seem to have been restricted as a definite title of honour, yet in legal documents the sons of peers are still styled merely "esquire". This latter fact points to the time when the prefix "honourable" was a mark of deference paid by others rather than a style assumed by right.
In international diplomatic relations, representatives of foreign states are often styled as The Honourable. Deputy chiefs of mission, chargés d'affaires, consuls-general and consuls are always given the style. All heads of consular posts, whether they are honorary or career postholders, are accorded the style according to the State Department of the United States.[1] However, the style Excellency instead of The Honourable is used for ambassadors and high commissioners.

A rough equivalent of the style Honourable would be Hochwohlgeboren 'high well-born', which was used until 1918 for all members of noble families not having any higher style. Its application to bourgeois dignitaries became common in the 19th century, though it has faded since and was always of doubtful correctness.

High state officials other than governor, such as lieutenant governor[24] and state attorneys general[25] are also accorded the style Honorable. State court judges and justices of the peace, like federal judges, also are accorded the style Honorable.[26] Practices vary on whether appointed state official, such as the heads of state cabinet-level departments are given the title.[18][17] There is also no universal rule for whether county or city officials other than the mayor (such as city council, board of aldermen, board of selectmen, planning and zoning commission, and code enforcement board members, or city manager or police chief or fire chief) are given the title; as these may be different state by state.[27]

Opinions vary on whether the term the Honorable is accorded for life.[18] According to the protocols of the U.S. Department of State, all persons who have been in a position that entitled them to The Honorable continue to retain that honorific style for life.[28] However, the State Department is not an authority on state and local officials such as mayors, members of state legislatures, and high state officials. The prefix is not used for people who have died.[17][29][30]

^ "The Honourable – style or title". Encyclopædia Britannica. Archived from the original on 6 February 2021. Retrieved 4 August 2022. (...) The Heralds' College officially reported on the petition on October 31, 1835, stating (...) that "the style of 'The Honourable' is given to the Judges and to the Barons of the Exchequer, with others; because, by the Decree of the tenth of King James the First, for settling the place and precedency of the Baronets, the Judges, and Barons of the Exchequer, were declared to have place and precedence before the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons."(...) The analogy held only in so far as both styles were applicable to those who belonged to the less exalted ranks of the titled classes, for the title "honourable" was not definitely confined to certain classes until later. The terms honorabilis and honorabilitas were in use in the Middle Ages as a form of politeness rather than as a specific title. More than two centuries later John Selden, in his Titles of Honor (1614), does not include "honourable" among the courtesy titles given to the children of peers.The style was, in fact, used extremely loosely until well on into the 18th century.(...) British baronets, for instance, claimed that they had been styled "the honourable" until the end of the 18th century, and in 1835 they petitioned for the style as a prefix to their names. The Heralds' College officially reported on the petition on October 31, 1835, stating that the presented evidence did not prove the right of baronets to the style and that its use "has been no more warranted by authority than when the same style has been applied to Field Officers in the Army and others.".(...) It is not, indeed, until 1874 that there is any clear evidence of an authoritative limitation of the title. In this year the wives of Lords of Appeal were granted style and precedence as baronesses, but it was provided that their children were not "to assume or use the prefix of Honourable, or to be entitled to the style, rank or precedence of the children of a Baron." In 1898, however, this was revoked, and it was ordained "that such children shall have and enjoy on all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of hereditary Barons together with the rank and precedence." By these acts of the Crown, the prefix "honourable" would seem to have been restricted as a definite title of honour, yet in legal documents the sons of peers are still styled merely "esquire". This latter fact points to the time when the prefix "honourable" was a mark of deference paid by others rather than a style assumed by right.

In the United Kingdom, all sons and daughters of viscounts and barons[6] (including the holders of life peerages) and the younger sons of earls are styled with this prefix. (The daughters and younger sons of dukes and marquesses and the daughters of earls have the higher style of Lord or Lady before their first names, and the eldest sons of dukes, marquesses and earls are known by one of their father's or mother's subsidiary titles.) The style is only a courtesy, however, and on legal documents they may be described as, for instance, John Smith, Esq., commonly called The Honourable John Smith. As the wives of sons of peers share the styles of their husbands, the wives of the sons of viscounts and barons and the younger sons of earls are styled, for example, The Hon. Mrs John Smith. Likewise, the married daughters of viscounts and barons, whose husbands hold no higher title or dignity, are styled, for example, The Hon. Mrs Smith.

Historically, a number of Australians were entitled to the style as members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Appointment to the Australian equivalent of the Privy Council, the Federal Executive Council, does not entitle a person to the style. Typical appointees to the Imperial Privy Council included senior politicians and judges at state and federal level. Malcolm Fraser in 1976 was the most recent prime minister to accept appointment to the Privy Council and thus to be styled Right Honourable. Of his 21 predecessors, only four were not members of the Privy Council – Alfred Deakin (declined appointment), Chris Watson (never offered), Arthur Fadden (accepted after leaving office), and Gough Whitlam (declined appointment). The last Governor-General to be entitled to the style was Sir Ninian Stephen, who left office in 1988. The last active politician to be entitled to the style was Ian Sinclair, who retired in 1998. The few Australian recipients of British peerages were also entitled to the style.

The style is also taken by Privy Counsellors, Peers below the rank of Marquess (which includes ladies who are Peers in their own right), the Lord Mayors of London and York and the Lord Provost of Edinburgh by ancient prescriptive usage."

Over the years, a number of prominent Canadians became members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and thus were entitled to use the style Right Honourable, either because of their services in Britain (e.g. serving as envoys to London) or as members of the Imperial War Cabinet, or due to their prominence in the Canadian Cabinet. These included all but three of Canada's early prime ministers (Alexander Mackenzie, John Abbott, and Mackenzie Bowell), who governed before the title was used domestically.

The Right Honourable (abbreviation: Rt Hon. or variations) is an honorific style traditionally applied to certain persons and collective bodies in the United Kingdom, the former British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations. The term is predominantly used today as a style associated with the holding of certain senior public offices in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and to a lesser extent, Australia.

Other lord mayors may be styled Right Worshipful, and other lord provosts do not use a style. By the 1920s, a number of city mayors, including the Lord Mayor of Leeds,[29] were unofficially using the style Right Honourable, and the matter was consequently raised in parliament. The Lord Mayor of Bristol at present still uses the style Right Honourable, without official permission.[30][31] In guidance issued in June 2003, the Crown Office recommended that the lord provosts of Aberdeen and Dundee be styled Right Honourable in the same manner as those of Edinburgh and Glasgow.[28]

In order to differentiate peers who are also members of the Privy Council—and therefore entitled to a style in both capacities—from peers who are not, the post-nominal letters PC can be used to identify the privy counsellors.[c] This applies to peers of all rank, as a holder of a dukedom or marquessate who becomes a Privy Counsellor retains their higher style and so could not be identified without the letters. In practice, in contexts where there might be confusion, official publications use the style Right Honourable exclusively to identify privy counsellors.[27][13]

Members of the Privy Council of Ireland were entitled to be styled Right Honourable, even after the Privy Council ceased to have any functions or to meet on the creation of the Irish Free State in December 1922. Nevertheless, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, like some of his counterparts in Great Britain, retained the use of the honorific style as a result of its having been conferred separately by legislation; in 2001 it was removed, as a consequence of local government law reform.
Right in this context is an adverb meaning 'very' or 'fully'.[1] Grammatically, The Right Honourable is an adjectival phrase which gives information about a person.[2] As such, it is not considered correct to apply it in direct address, nor to use it on its own as a title in place of a name; but rather it is used in the third person along with a name or noun to be modified.[3][4][a]
No new appointments have been made to the Privy Council of Northern Ireland since 1971, but surviving appointed members remain entitled to the style.

Ferrers (1989), cc. 1117WA–1118WA, "For official purposes, the style is omitted in many circumstances, owing to the need for brevity, clarity or informality, as the occasion dictates. For example, the style is omitted in lists of Ministers for Peers who fall below the rank of Marquess and who are not Privy Counsellors in order to distinguish them from Peers who are Privy Counsellors."
Referring to one another as honourable is merely a courtesy used within the House, and is not a style used outside the chamber. However, when a member is in fact entitled to be styled Right Honourable (in practice always through membership of the Privy Council), they are referred to as such in the chamber. Further embellishments are traditionally applied to clergy (reverend), military officers (gallant) and barristers (learned), a practice recommended to be abolished following a 2010 report of the Modernisation Committee but in practice continued.[38][39] In summary:
^ In Hansard, references to other MPs are expanded to include a constituency or ministerial office (and name in parenthesis) as an aid to readers, whether or not this is what was actually said. Honourable is presently always abbreviated to hon.

Black's Titles and Forms of Address claims[14] that the capitalised The before substantive peers' titles is an abbreviated form of their style. For example, "The Earl of Beaconsfield" would be short for "The Right Honourable Earl of Beaconsfield". However, this argument does not account for the second The in commonly-found formulations of the kind "The Right Honourable The Earl of Beaconsfield"[15] or "The Most Honourable The Marquess of Salisbury"[16]; and the argument is not corroborated by other guides which recommend the latter forms.[17][18][19]
