Rubbing that is too frequent or forceful will cause blisters, as opposed to calluses, to form.
Biologically, calluses are formed by the accumulation of terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the outermost layer of skin. Though the cells of calluses are dead, they are quite resistant to mechanical and chemical damage due to extensive networks of cross-linked proteins and hydrophobic keratin intermediate filaments containing many disulfide bonds.[7] It is the natural reaction of the palmar or plantar skin. Too much friction occurring too fast for the skin to develop a protective callus will cause a blister or abrasion instead.
Calluses and corns may heal by themselves eventually, once the irritation is consistently avoided. They may also be dissolved with keratolytic agents containing salicylic acid, sanded down with a pumice stone or silicon carbide sandpaper or filed down with a callus shaver, or pared down by a professional such as a podiatrist.[11]

Corns and calluses are easier to prevent than to treat.When it is undesirable to form a callus, minimizing rubbing and pressure will prevent callus formation.Footwear should be properly fitted,[10] gloves may be worn, and protective pads, rings or skin dressings may be used.People with poor circulation or sensation should check their skin often for signs of rubbing and irritation so they can minimize any damage.[citation needed]
Calluses in the hands are frequently associated with manual labor and blue-collar workers.[15][16][17] During the Gads Hill Train Robbery in 1874, the James–Younger Gang purportedly refrained from robbing men with calloused hands, assuming them to be working class laborers.[18][19] Such notion is also present in Māori culture, where the words raupā and raupo refer to hands left cracked and chapped due to manual work, and are used as similes for someone deemed a hard worker.[20][21]

A callus is an area of thickened and sometimes hardened skin that forms as a response to repeated friction, pressure, or other irritation.Since repeated contact is required, calluses are most often found on the feet and hands, but they may occur anywhere on the skin. Some degree of callus, such as on the bottom of the foot, is normal.[1]

Calluses have also been known to develop on the forehead from the frequent prostrations required in Muslim prayer; known as a prayer bump or zebiba, such calluses are considered marks of piety in some Muslim countries, and people have been known to take special steps, such as praying on straw mats, to encourage the callus to develop.[22]

Calluses are generally not harmful and help prevent blisters, as well as offering protection.[2] However, excessive formation may sometimes lead to other problems, such as a skin ulceration or infection, or cause the affected person to try to offload the affected painful area, which can place excessive stress on the asymptomatic side.

People with diabetes face special skin challenges. Because diabetes affects the capillaries, the small blood vessels which feed the skin, thickening of the skin with callus increases the difficulty of supplying nutrients to the skin.[12] Callus formation is seen in high numbers of patients with diabetes, and together with absent foot pulses and formation of hammer toe,[13][14] this may be an early sign of individuals at an increased risk for foot ulcers.[13]

Although calluses can occur anywhere on the body as a reaction to moderate, constant "grinding" pressure, they are mostoften found on the foot (where the most pressure and friction are applied). On the feet, arguably the source of the most problematic calluses, they typically form on the metatarsal-phalangeal joint area ("balls of the foot"), heels and small toes due to the compression applied by tightly fitting shoes.
Sometimes a callus occurs where there is no rubbing or pressure. These hyperkeratoses can have a variety of causes. Some toxic materials, such as arsenic, can cause thick palms and soles. Some diseases, such as syphilis, can cause thickening of the palms and soles as well as pinpoint hyperkeratoses. There is a benign condition called keratosis palmaris et plantaris, which produces corns in the creases of the fingers and non-weight bearing spaces of the feet. Some of this may be caused by actinic keratosis, which occurs due to overexposure to sun or with age and hormonal shifts.

The location of the soft corns tends to differ from that of hard corns. Hard corns occur on dry, flat surfaces of skin. Soft corns (frequently found between adjacent toes) stay moist, keeping the surrounding skin soft. The corn's center is not soft however, but indurated.

The stiffness of a callus or corn, coupled with the shear and pressure that caused it, may tear the capillaries or adjoining tissue, causing bleeding within the callus or corn. This can often be result of trying to pick, cut, or shave off the callus by yourself at home. Although the bleeding can be small, sometimes small pools of blood or hematoma are formed. The blood itself is an irritant, a foreign body within the callus that makes the area burn or itch. If the pool of blood is exposed to the outside, infection may follow. Infection may also lead to ulceration. This process can be prevented at several places.Diabetic foot infections are the leading cause of diabetic limb amputation.

Normally, a callus will form on any part of the skin exposed to excess friction over a long period of time. Activities that are known for causing calluses include (but are not limited to) construction work, many sports, wood carving, playing musical instruments,[3] use of a chef's knife, rock climbing, hiking, martial arts, weight training, rowing, BMXing,[4][5] dancing (especially ballet), chopping wood, monkey bars, pacing and wearing high heels.[6]

A corn (or clavus, plural clavi) is a cone-shaped callus that penetrates into the dermis, usually on the feet or hands. Corns may form due to chronic pressure or rubbing at a pressure point (in this skin over a bone), or due to scar tissue from a healing wound creating pressure in a weight-bearing area such as the sole of the foot. If there is constant stimulation of the tissue producing the corns, even after the corn is surgically removed, the skin may continue to grow as a corn.[1][8]

Calluses may also form on the fingertips from the repeated pressure and friction of playing stringed instruments. This formation of calluses allows the player to repeatedly depress the strings without causing pain. Because of this, callus formation is viewed as something of a rite of passage for beginner string players.

The hard part at the center of the corn resembles a funnel with a broad raised top and a pointed bottom. Because of their shape, corns intensify the pressure at the tip and can cause deep tissue damage and ulceration.[9] The scientific name for a corn is heloma (plural helomata). A hard corn is called a heloma durum, while a soft corn is called a heloma molle.
Plant species representing all major land plant groups have been shown to be capable of producing callus in tissue culture.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] A callus cell culture is usually sustained on gel medium. Callus induction medium consists of agar and a mixture of macronutrients and micronutrients for the given cell type.There are several types of basal salt mixtures used in plant tissue culture, but most notably modified Murashige and Skoog medium,[13] White's medium,[14] and woody plant medium.[15]Vitamins are also provided to enhance growth such as Gamborg B5 vitamins.[16]For plant cells, enrichment with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is especially important.Plant callus is usually derived from somatic tissues. The tissues used to initiate callus formation depends on plant species and which tissues are available for explant culture. The cells that give rise to callus and somatic embryos usually undergo rapid division or are partially undifferentiated such as meristematic tissue.In alfalfa, Medicago truncatula, however callus and somatic embryos are derived from mesophyll cells that undergo dedifferentiation.[17]Plant hormones are used to initiate callus growth. After the callus has formed, the concentration of hormones in the medium may be altered to shift the development from callus to root formation, shoot growth or somatic embryogenesis. The callus tissues then undergo further cell growth and differentiation, forming the respective organ primordia. The fully developed organs can then be used for the regeneration of the new mature plants.

"Ontogeny of embryogenic callus in Medicago truncatula: the fate of the pluripotent and totipotent stem cells"
Specific auxin to cytokinin ratios in plant tissue culture medium give rise to an unorganized growing and dividing mass of callus cells. Callus cultures are often broadly classified as being either compact or friable. Compact calluses are typically green and sturdy, while friable calluses are white to creamy yellow in color, fall apart easily and can be used to generate cell suspension cultures and somatic embryos. In maize, these two callus types are designated as type I (compact) and type II (friable).[18]Callus can directly undergo direct organogenesis and/or embryogenesis where the cells will form an entirely new plant.

Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau investigated wound-healing responses in elm trees, and was the first to report formation of callus on live plants.[25]
Callus cells are not necessarily genetically homogeneous because a callus is often made from structural tissue, not individual cells.[clarification needed] Nevertheless, callus cells are often considered similar enough for standard scientific analysis to be performed as if on a single subject. For example, an experiment may have half a callus undergo a treatment as the experimental group, while the other half undergoes a similar but non-active treatment as the control group.
Callus can brown and die during culture, mainly due to oxidation of phenolic compounds.In Jatropha curcas callus cells, small organized callus cells became disorganized and varied in size after browning occurred.[19] Browning has also been associated with oxidation and phenolic compounds in both explant tissues and explant secretions.[20] In rice, presumably, a condition which is favorable for scutellar callus induction induces necrosis too.[21]

Plant callus (plural calluses or calli) is a growing mass of unorganized plant parenchyma cells. In living plants, callus cells are those cells that cover a plant wound. In biological research and biotechnology callus formation is induced from plant tissue samples (explants) after surface sterilization and plating onto tissue culture medium in vitro (in a closed culture vessel such as a Petri dish).[1]The culture medium is supplemented with plant growth regulators, such as auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin, to initiate callus formation or somatic embryogenesis.Callus initiation has been described for all major groups of land plants.
In 1908, E. F. Simon was able to induce callus from poplar stems that also produced roots and buds.[26]The first reports of callus induction in vitro came from three independent researchers in 1939.[27]P. White induced callus derived from tumor-developing procambial tissues of hybrid Nicotiana glauca that did not require hormone supplementation.[14]Gautheret and Nobecourt were able to maintain callus cultures of carrot using auxin hormone additions.[citation needed]

Callus is of particular use in micropropagation where it can be used to grow genetically identical copies of plants with desirable characteristics. To increase the yield, efficiency and explant survivability of micropropagation, a thorough care is taken for the optimization of the micropropagation protocol. For example, using explants composed of low totipotency cells may prolong the time necessary to obtain callus of sufficient size, increasing the total length of the experiment. Similarly, various plant species and explant types require specific plant hormones for callus induction and subsequent organogenesis or embryogenesis – for the formation and growth of maize calluses, auxin 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was superior to 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), while the development of callus was hindered in prune explants after applying auxin Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) but not IAA.[23][24]

Genes can be inserted into callus cells using biolistic bombardment, also known as a gene gun, or Agrobacterium tumefaciens.Cells that receive the gene of interest can then be recovered into whole plants using a combination of plant hormones.The whole plants that are recovered can be used to experimentally determine gene function(s), or to enhance crop plant traits for modern agriculture.

Plant calluses derived from many different cell types can differentiate into a whole plant, a process called regeneration, through addition of plant hormones to the culture medium.This ability is known as totipotency. A classical experiment by Folke Skoog and Carlos O. Miller on tobacco pith used as the starting explant shows that the supplementation of culture media by different ratios of auxin to cytokinin concentration induces the formation of roots – with higher auxin to cytokinin ratio, the rooting (rhizogenesis) is induced, applying equal amounts of both hormones stimulates further callus growth and increasing the auxin to cytokinin ratio in favor of the cytokinin leads to the development of shoots.[22] Regeneration of a whole plant from a single cell allows transgenics researchers to obtain whole plants which have a copy of the transgene in every cell.Regeneration of a whole plant that has some genetically transformed cells and some untransformed cells yields a chimera.In general, chimeras are not useful for genetic research or agricultural applications.

Callus was originally an unnamed horse that Joel used to pursue Ellie when she rode off on a different horse. The pair decided to keep him to assist in traveling to find the Fireflies. The horse remained loyal to the two as they traveled from the hydroelectric dam in Jackson County to the University of Eastern Colorado.[1]

Callus was then used by Ellie during the winter months to search the woods for food for the trio. On one occasion, Ellie noticed a deer, leaving Callus reined to a tree while she pursued it. However, she returned with nothing, having encountered the hostile cannibals David and James, and rode Callus back to where Joel was.[5]

A while later, he guarded Joel (if unknowingly) at the Colorado Mountain Plaza while Ellie searched the area for medical supplies to heal Joel. However, the noises he made attracted hostile survivors that had pursued the trio from the university, forcing Ellie to kill them. Callus then carried Joel and Ellie to the town of Silver Lake in Colorado, where they took shelter in a house while Joel recuperated.[4]

While traveling, Ellie named the horse Callus, since Tommy had not revealed his name. Joel, disliking it, remarked that Callus was an unusual name for a horse. While there, Callus was agitated upon hearing a group of runners in one of the buildings, indicating that it had encountered infected when Tommy owned him.[1]
Later, while David was fighting Ellie in the abandoned restaurant, he taunted her by saying that his group would eat the horse.[6]
Callus remained outside the science building as Joel and Ellie searched the area, only for a man to attempt to take him. Before he could do so, Ellie returned with a badly wounded Joel, and shot the man dead. Callus then fled the university carrying the pair, only to come to a stop when Joel passed out from his wound.[3]

The next day, Ellie tried to create a distraction to lure a search party of cannibals away from the house that Joel was recovering in. After being spotted, Ellie and Callus took off, dodging bullets from the survivors. When coming up to a ledge, Callus was shot, falling off the path and dying upon impact with the ground, leaving Ellie distraught at his death.

A glitch can occur where, if Joel climbs on Callus' back but Ellie is not already on, he will still say "'scoot'" regardless.
