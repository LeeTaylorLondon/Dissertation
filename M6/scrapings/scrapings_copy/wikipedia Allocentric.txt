suffix meaning ‘having a specified object at the centre, or as the focus of attention’
[Stanley C.] Plog recognised that personalities change over time, and given time, the psychocentrics may become allocentric in their choice of holiday destination and activity as they gain experience of travel.
Remember that whether a tourist is more psychocentric or more allocentric depends on the different motivations and the different destinations chosen by the tourist. The tourist may also oscillate between both psychocentric and allocentric choices. For example, a tourist may choose an allocentric holiday in December to a remote game reserve, but have a psychocentric short break in July to Singapore, where he or she may prefer a package tour and will stick to the touristy areas of town.

[P]sychocentrics could conceivably vacation in essentially allocentric destinations (with the exception of people with extremely low incomes). For instance, a psychocentric may travel to a remote area under the security of a completely planned, fully escorted tour.

(psychology, tourism) A tourist who tends to be adventurous and to prefer novel and unfamiliar experiences.Coordinate terms: midcentric, psychocentric1995,Robert Madrigal,“Personal Values, Traveler Personality Type, and Leisure Travel Style”, inJournal of Leisure Research‎[2], volume 27, number 2, Arlington, Va.: National Recreation and Park Association, DOI:10.1080/00222216.1995.11949738, ISSN 0022-2216, OCLC 639059607, archived from the original on 14 August 2021, page 128:According to [Stanley C.] Plog (1991b), psychocentrics tend to prefer a high degree of familiarity in their travel and, as a result, enjoy group or "packaged" tours.

While Plog's model is a continuum with indefinite points, he was able to divide tourists into five main groups: psychocentrics, near psychocentrics, midcentrics, near allocentrics, and allocentrics.
At the one extreme, psychocentrics are those travellers that are not adventurous, and seek amenities and culture similar to their home environment. At the other end of the continuum, an allocentric tourist is very adventurous, seeks and embraces different cultures, local food, and requires only basic tourism infrastructure.
The adjective is derived from allo- (prefix meaning ‘different; other’) +‎ -centric (suffix meaning ‘having a specified object at the centre, or as the focus of attention’).[1] Sense 3 (‘of a tourist: tending to be adventurous’) was coined by the American travel researcher Stanley C. Plog in a paper presented to the Southern California Chapter of the Travel Research Association on 10 October 1972, which was later published in February 1974.[2]
