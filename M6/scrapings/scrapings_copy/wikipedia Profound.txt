Created in Denmark in 1999 by Christian Karsten Hansen and Jan Møller Mikkelsen, formerly of Novo Nordisk, the company was funded by venture capital and a loan from Vækstfonden. After rapidly growing to employ 50 scientists, and filing large numbers of patent applications, the company was acquired by Maxygen in 2000, for $60 million in stock.[2] From its acquisition by Maxygen until 2008, the company continued as a subsidiary of Maxygen forming the cornerstone of its biopharmaceutical business, and contributing to Maxygen´s molecular breeding technology. With NeuroSearch, Genmab and Zealand Pharma, Profound Pharma was among the early members of the Medicon Valley biotech cluster. Its initial directors were Dr. Claus Bræstrup, Prof. Thue Schwartz and Knud Aunstrup.[3]

The sixth single from the album was released later in April 2022, two days before the album's release. "If You Want Me", featuring singer-songwriter Susanne Sundfør, was released with both another Zawada-made visualizer and another accompanying short film, Mycelium, directed by Martin Werner.[25] Sundfør made a corresponding statement that "it’s always fun to work with the mushrooms, and I think this song and everything we’re working on at the moment is the best we’ve ever created together.”[26]

Röyksopp had stated in 2014 that their fifth studio album, The Inevitable End, would be their final release in the "traditional album format".[5][6][7] In 2016 (with the release of the non-album single "Never Ever"), Torbjørn Brundtland from the band explained that this was because they "have many musical expressions that we want to do … but we don’t necessarily want to do an album of it," and Svein Berge, the other half of the duo, later added that because it dealt "with things ending and death" it "felt like a natural send off at that point," with them "finding new ways of releasing the music in the future."[8][9]

Because scheduling constraints prevented Nilsson from taking on the entire project, instead Lygner suggested a broader collaboration, with nine of the company's directors each creating a short film to accompany one song in the collection.[23] The band then chose the directors and which song each of them would work with, set a "very basic" set of rules ("The film needs to be at least 20 seconds long and contain some element of the track they are making the film for") before stepping back to allow those directors full creative freedom.[23] The resulting videos were not music videos, because the audio in each film would generally not be an exact match for what is present on the album, to make it better fit with the visuals.[23]

Profound Mysteries received critical acclaim from music critics.[38][31][35][39][29] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 5 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[28]
In addition to the music, the album's accompanying video elements (both visualizers and short films) also received praise from critics,[31][37] with Piatowski describing them as "a gorgeous visual interpretation of the music" and Clash Magazine's Kieran Macdonald-Brown describing the project overall as "an engaging, expressive multimedia universe suspended in digital mystery, a sum of many components meticulously executed … best experienced as an audiovisual entity, with each track forged as two sides of one coin" (though noting that "every piece of this puzzle soars in its own right").[31]

In April 2022, Röyksopp confirmed that there would be a total of 10 short films to accompany the project: one for each of the 10 tracks.[24] Back in January 2021, the band had reached out to the Scandinavian production company, Bacon, to establish this series of short films.[23] Bacon's Executive Managing Producer, Magne Lygner, later informed FLOOD Magazine that "initially, the approach was for one director for the whole concept," with the band considering Andreas Nilsson for the role.[23] The band later described the project as "all about the word ‘mystery,’ and also subjectivity; what the listener/viewer ‘reads’ into what they see and hear," because they “like to think that there is an ambiguous quality—sometimes even paradoxical duality" to their music and were "curious as to how the directors would experience and interpret our music without any interference or ‘background’ story from us."[23] Talking with Creative Review, Berge explained that this concept was partially inspired by the films of David Lynch, such as 2001's Mulholland Drive, which they felt were about evoking reactions in the observer, rather than them "just… being passive."

Espen Borge of NRK P3 stated that "the duo's latest work shows an unmistakable «röyksoppian» relaxation and almost nonchalant belief in their own sound."[36] Timothy Monger of AllMusic viewed the album as "less sonically aggressive than their previous album, Profound Mysteries still has something of an edge to it and its overall tone of ghostly enchantment makes for a strangely captivating listen" and stated that "the music is perhaps darker and more haunting than anything the band has previously released".[30] Tallulah Boote Bond of The Line of Best Fit noted that "Röyksopp uses the treasures found on their eight year gap to create a theatrical, dramatic, literal work of art" and that the album is "a move towards a more organic electronic sound".[34] Peter Piatkowski of PopMatters noted that the album is "transcendent" and commented on Goldfrapp's voice as an "airy, ethereal voice [that is] a perfect match for Röyksopp’s sounds."[37]
