On the other hand, some literary critics hold escapist fiction in high regard, expressing it as a genre possessing a thematic depth and ideological complexity that is both appealing to readers and influential. These people argue against the negative connotations associated with escapist fiction. They argue that through encouraging readers to "escape" escapist fiction has the ability to position its readers to be perceptive to didactic and potentially formative ideological assumptions. Those who advocate for escapist fiction as a genre believe it holds a formative value for adolescents as they mature and can therefore offer similar socialising value to readers.[10] For a long time creators and consumers of escapist fiction have been placed (and still are placed) in a position of inferiority, therefore, escapist fiction is an excluded genre from recognition and scholarship.[15] The ideological views presented in escapist fiction are often implicit, that is, representations throughout escapist literature are informed and structured according to the accepted cultural and societal constructions.[10]
Escapist fiction is fiction that provides psychological escape from reality by immersing readers in a "new world" created by the author.[1] This "new world" aims to compensate for the arbitrariness and the unpredictability of the real one.[1] Typically, an author of escapist fiction offers structure, rationality and resolution to real world problems throughout their medium.[1] The genre facilitates mentalisation; that is, escapist fiction encourages psychological engagement from the reader.[1] Escapist fiction is often contrasted with realism, which confronts the reader with the harsh reality of war, disease, family dysfunction, crime, foreclosure, death, etc.[2] It encompasses a number of different genres within it; any fiction that immerses the reader into a world different from their own is fundamentally escapist fiction.[3] Escapist literature aims to give readers imaginative entertainment rather than to address contemporary issues and provoke serious and critical thoughts.[4]

Escapist literature aims to create a relatable and believable alternate world, where the inhabitants struggle with dilemmas that the reader may encounter.[16] Escapist fiction contains elements of reality, self-improvement and deep-seated truths, and can explore moral and ethical themes within an entertaining medium. There is an intrinsic need for escape that is embedded within humans to maintain sanity, escapist literature allows a window for readers to view historical and instinctual lessons. Escapist fiction can be a representation for how things ought to be in the world, encouraging readers to understand underlying problems and challenges of the real world within the context of an alternate world.[9]

J. R. R. Tolkien, a linguistic scholar, is one of the essential figures in escapist fiction. He is the author of The Lord of the Rings, which is a classic example of escapist fiction. He wrote it to illustrate the meaning of his essay "On Fairy-Stories". He admitted that fairy stories were something of an escape, he believed people should be provided an escape from the world of factories, machine guns and bombs.[7] Though fairy-stories are by no means the only medium of escape, they are one of the more obvious and (to some) outrageous forms of "escapist" literature.[8] The popular titles such as the Harry Potter series by written by J. K. Rowling, The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis, Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games, and Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, are examples of escapist fiction. Each of these novels allow the reader to essentially escape into a fantasy world that is not their own. It can be argued that these novels, and similar novels, add to the understanding that escapist fiction is not a negative thing. These novels can provide readers with a moral compass or teach them lessons, they can be interpreted as a medium to represent and overcome an individual's personal fears, shortcomings, and, at times the need for this "escape". The secondary world, or fantastical one, is something that closely mirrors the primary one and would not be successful or satisfying if readers could not imagine it as realistic and relatable.[9] Escapist fiction employs narrative strategies that engage and immerse readers whilst also distancing reader from their world and society. Escapist fiction seeks to engage readers in reflective and inquisitive processes encouraging readers to question and challenge their own cultural and social realities. A key element in escapist fiction is using techniques that encourage readers to enter into a new world whilst dually constructing a position of critical engagement. That is, a position whereby readers are encouraged to think critically and reflect upon contemporary social ideologies; identity, agency, the environment, social constructs, politics etc.[10]
Fantasy literature is escapist in nature, creating another world where the reader and protagonist escape their familiar surroundings and enter into a different and new environment. Escapist fiction creates these alternate, fantasy worlds to escape the immediate socio-political and economic settings of the real world.[14] The secondary world created in works of escapist fiction is something that closely mirrors the primary one. The secondary world is also a way of understanding and coping with the things we want to escape from in our primary world. This secondary world would not be successful if readers did not see it as plausible, real, and relating to their own world.[9] Escapist fiction, in particular fantasy fiction, does allow a departure from our world in that it frees itself from the restraints of normality and everyday life. Much of escapist fiction is allegorical and utilises features of worldliness in a variety of ways in order to comment on modern life. Escapist fiction often seeks to examine a deeper element of human existence and purpose. Escapist literature tends to confront contemporary issues, in particular moral and political matters, through a moral journey the reader undertakes where they can learn important life lessons in the fictional world. Escapist fiction can provide readers with a rich literature that deals with universal issues of humanity, especially the matters of childhood experience and adolescence. Escapist fiction authors construct alternate worlds in order to comment on our world implicitly through the differences and explicitly in the similarities. The fundamental purpose of escapist fiction is to comment on the real world and explore the moral, social, political and philosophical dilemmas that exist within it. Through confronting contemporary issues, escapist fiction authors aim to shift conventional perspectives and reveal a moral insight.[14] As a genre of fiction that requires a substantial level of immersion into the world of the text, escapist fiction has the potential to greatly influence readers.
As a multifaceted literary genre, escapist fiction contains thematic depth and complex ideologies that seek to persuade the reader to reconsider their views of the world. Escapist fiction uses techniques that seek to encourage readers engagement and fulfilment of "escape" through the use of closely focalised narration. The use of present tense narration is also prevalent in escapist fiction as it invites readers to engage directly with character, story and setting. Narration is a significant feature of escapist fiction as it is imperative for maximum engagement, as such, the displacement of readers into another world affects ideological interpellation and interpretations.[10]

One of the most well-known canonical examples of escapist literature is Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. This work of escapist fiction describes characters in an entirely new, fictional universe complete with its own history and languages. Tolkien explores the themes of right and wrong, and emphasises the significance of small acts of bravery. These are themes that are prominent in most escapist literature.[16]

The designation of escape in literature, known as escapist fiction, dates back to the 1930s. The word "escapism" was born in the 1930s and grew rapidly in usage. In the 1940s and the 1950s the term escapism in terms of literature was largely criticised. In the 1960s and 1970s the concept of "escape" in literature emerged as a mode of dealing with imperfect existence where the reader could temporarily escape reality.[5] The conceptual idea and intention of escapist literature is to erase difference and to free readers of the intricacies and responsibilities of historical specificity.[9]
There are many negative connotations attached to escapist fiction.[9] Some literary critics and academics have classified escapist fiction and genres of science-fiction, thriller, mystery, romance and fantasy, as sub-literary and unworthy of being regarded as true literature.[6] Early critics complained that escapist fiction as a literary genre misleads readers in terms of the harsh truths of reality. Early entertainment and literature tended to view escapist fiction as a lower-class phenomenon. Assuming that the alienation, deprivation and restriction of lower-class life caused a desire to escape in these "underprivileged" individuals.[13] These critics deem escapist fiction to be shallow and superficial, with its worth being degraded to simply a source of entertainment. Some literary critics have deemed escapist fiction as frivolous and frequently dismiss it as a literary genre.[6] These people argue that escapist fiction has little value for adolescent socialisation.[10]

Historically, the arts, and literature in particular, have been acknowledged for its ability to distract readers from the hardships of reality. During the Great Depression, readers turned to escapist fiction as it provided them a mental escape from the bleakness of the economy during that period of time.[5] Fiction books and novels were an affordable and easy means for readers to escape into another world, so people used escapist fiction to provide them with a temporary psychological escape from the realities of their world.[5]
Labelling a work "escapist fiction" can be to minimise it. Those who defend works described as escapist either assert that they are not escapist—for example, that a science fiction novel's satiric aspects address real life—or defend the notion of "escape" as such, not "escapism"—as J. R. R. Tolkien does in his "On Fairy-Stories" and C. S. Lewis's quotation, in his "On Science Fiction" of Tolkien's question of who would be most hostile to the idea of escape, and his answer: jailers.

The concept of individuals using different forms of medium, such as fiction, to "escape" from the limitations and dissatisfaction of everyday life is known as "escapist fiction". It is because of this that some people may argue that most fiction and the act of reading itself, is a pursuit of escapism.[6]

During the Great Depression in the 1930s, people began to turn to escapist fiction because it provided readers with a mental escape from the alarming rates of unemployment and the overall decline of the economy during that period of time. Despite the economic devastation of the Great Depression during this period of time people were granted the opportunity to experience leisure time. Popular culture, and the entertainment and amusement it provided may be considered crucial in maintaining the public's well being during the harsh reality of the period. Reading genres such as escapist fiction during this period allowed people to escape from the uncertainties, anxieties and loss of self-esteem resulting from the Great Depression period. Popular culture, in particular escapist fiction as a genre, thrived and evolved during the 1930s unlike other industries. Owing to the unemployment during the depression, people had more free time and sought-after ways to fill their time and escape the bleak reality they faced.[11]Most popular culture and fiction created during the period of 1929 to 1941 did not deal with or contain any explicit references to the harsh realities of the Great Depression as a topic. This further supports this idea that in this context popular culture and fiction were largely utilised as a vehicle to escape the deprived and alienated living conditions characteristic of the period.[12] In the 1950s and 1960s people tended to view the topic of escapism through a socio-political perspective, analysing how the dysfunctions of society trigger peoples need for escape.[13] Reading fiction during the Great Depression was popular, readers searching for escapist literature had a vast array of materials to choose from, such as "pulps", comic strips, comic books, fiction novels, etc.[12]

In the beginning, the player selects their name and can choose the names of prisoners and guards if desired. Once the names are selected the game starts from day 1 waking up in the player character's cell. Players can acquire various items to aid in their escape by buying or stealing them from other inmates, or by crafting them by combining two or three items, such as toothpaste and talcum powder which crafts putty that a key can be imprinted then moulded with. Players can do favours for fellow inmates, once the favour is completed the player is rewarded a certain amount of money based on the inmate's opinion of the player. Inmate favours can range from getting them a roll of duct tape to distracting the guards at roll call.

The first DLC, "Fhurst Peak Correctional Facility" was originally added as a bonus prison for Early Access players, but was added as DLC due to popular demand as an extra prison.[9]
Eurogamer recommended the game, concluding that while it had minor frustrations, "there's nothing here that really spoils what is an otherwise delightful and endlessly surprising game".[24]GameSpot finished by saying the game would provide hours of gratifying entertainment, and with the developer working on tools for user-generated content, it could provide even more in the future.[20]
Reviews highlighted the freedom in approach that the game allowed, and reviewers told stories of their break outs. GameSpot writer Cameron Woolsey described tunnelling his way out, Official Xbox Magazine (OXM) writer Andy Kelly, described hiding his ventilation system escape by crafting a fake papier-mâché vent cover, while X-One's Dom Peppiatt straightforwardly shivved a guard and stole his keys.[20][22][23]

There are a number of escape methods including inciting riots, via vents, tunnels, roofs, among others. Each prison has layers of security ranging from electric fences to chip resistant high walls. The prisoner will generally need various weapons to win a fight with inmates or guards. There are many types of weapons such as a guard's baton or plastic fork.
The game was released for Steam Early Access in August 2014.[7] Feedback from the early access release allowed Davis to improve the game, such as by adjusting the difficulty. It allowed him to experiment with ideas and solicit suggestions from the player community.Davis stated that, "the community is what made the game into what it is", and that "Early Access has been a really good experience for the game."The full game was released in February 2015.[8]

Engaging in exercise and using the library allows players to levels up their characters statics such as strength, speed, and intelligence which improves their abilities and their chance of escape. Each prison has their own daily routines, such as meals, work, exercise and showers. An inmate can skip a meal, showers and exercise without much penalty, however, all roll calls are mandatory and lockdowns will occur if the player character does not attend. Inmates must be careful to hide all contraband as guards will periodically search the inmates' desks, and if caught with contraband, it is removed from their inventory and the player is sent into solitary confinement and any damage such as chipped walls, broken vents and tunnels are repaired and the weapon is removed.

The game was inspired by the 1984 video game Skool Daze, one of Davis's favourite titles. Davis limited the hint system and the tutorial to encourage experimentation by the players. He hoped that by allowing players to discover the solution themselves, they would feel a greater sense of achievement.[6]For inspiration, Davis watched prison films and researched prison escapes.

Reviewers were mixed on the learning curve presented by the game, even positive reviews such as OXM's acknowledged that the game "won't be for everyone", requiring "patience and a creative mind" in the player.[22] Without an in depth tutorial, X-One believed the game "perhaps relies a little too heavily on trial-and-error".[23]Kimberley Wallace, writing at Game Informer found this trial-and-error approach frustrating, finding herself "constantly punished for mistakes and losing progress" due to outcomes which were impossible to predict.On the other hand, she felt this level of challenge contributed to "a grand sense of accomplishment when you win".[19]
Game Informer criticized the interaction with other inmates as shallow and artificial, requiring the player to perform "boring favours" to "just [raise] a meter".[19]Richard Cobbett, writing for IGN, noted that how despite the "adorable 16-bit style graphics", he would quickly perceive fellow prison inmates without empathy as "pure puzzle game piece[s]" rather than characters. He also stated "As a mix of sandbox, puzzle and open-world action, The Escapists offers something fresh and entertaining."[21] OXM felt the game had character, citing the non-player characters' "amusing non sequiturs and pop culture references".[22]Dan Whitehead at Eurogamer agreed, praising the game's "thriving social element" which make it easy to get "sucked into the petty vendettas and mini dramas of day to day prison life."[24]

In The Escapists, the player, who assumes the role of a prisoner, must escape from six primary prisons ranging from very easy to very hard. Each time a prison is escaped the next prison is unlocked. There are additional prisons released as downloadable content (DLC) which can be played in any order regardless of the player's progress.

Chabon created the Escapist as an homage to the heroes of the Golden Age of Comic Books. The character's abilities as an escape artist are inspired by escape artist Harry Houdini as well as Robin Hood and Albert Schweitzer.[1] Another inspiration was the early illusionist career of comic book artist Jim Steranko.[2]
The Escapist's true identity is Tom Mayflower. He is the crippled nephew of escape artist Max Mayflower (who performs under the stage name of Misterioso). When Max is fatally shot while performing onstage, he reveals that he isn't his real uncle, having rescued him from a cruel orphanage as a baby. He gives Tom a golden key and a costume, explaining that he was recruited long ago by a mysterious organization called the League of the Golden Key to fight tyranny and free the oppressed. With his dying breath, Max commissions Tom to carry on his work. As long as Tom is wearing the costume and the key, he finds that he is no longer lame of leg and can perform amazing feats of escapology.[6] Tom uses his powers to fight crime under the guise of the Escapist, especially against the evil forces of the mysterious criminal network, the Iron Chain.[7]
The comic book won "Best Anthology" at the 2005 Eisner Awards. It is also notable for featuring the final story of The Spirit by the late Will Eisner, which appeared in issue #6 of The Escapist.

Like The Shadow, the Escapist is assisted in his quest by specially gifted agents, his sidekicks, who include the former circus strongman Big Al, exotic Asian beauty Miss Plum Blossom, and Omar, an East Indian mystic who possesses the power of hypnosis.

During World War II, the League makes the Escapist an emergency Champion of Freedom and grants him full access to the powers of the Golden Key. This temporarily grants the Escapist superhuman strength and agility, allowing him to openly combat the Axis forces (coinciding in the novel with Joe Kavalier's feeling of helplessness as the war continues to rage on, while he is unable to rescue his family from Nazi-occupied Europe). Following the war, the Escapist's abilities return to their original level.

The Escapist is a superhero character created by Michael Chabon in the 2000 novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. In the novel, the Escapist is a fictional character created by the comics writer protagonists. The character later featured in the metafictional work Michael Chabon Presents the Amazing Adventures of the Escapist and Brian K. Vaughan's comic The Escapists.
In 2006, writer Brian K. Vaughan took on a 6-part mini-series titled The Escapists, which follows a longtime fan's dreams of reviving the character in all new comic adventures. Partly mirroring the story of Kavalier and Clay, The Escapists focuses on Cleveland-born Jewish writer Max Roth, whose late father was an avid Escapist fan. Using his inheritance money to buy the rights to the character, Max teams with artist Case Weaver and letterer Denny Jones, the latter of whom dresses as the Escapist and stops a crime in an attempt to stir up publicity for their comic. Inevitably, things begin to spiral out of the trio's control.

In a story meant to embody and comment on the darker "grim and gritty" trend of modern comics, the original Escapist is said to have been killed in action, leaving a young locksmith as his successor. The new Escapist is aided by a new Luna Moth, who claims to be the original Escapist's daughter. She is soon revealed as a fraud however and betrays him to his enemies. When all seems lost, the dark and violent world fades, revealed as a dream of Tom Mayflower, still very much alive. This coincides in the "real world" with Max Roth losing the rights to the Escapist to a corporation that prefers to revert the series to its classic style.
In the comic-within-a-comic sequences of The Escapists, Tom's final fate is revealed and a new Escapist takes up the mantle of the hero. Things are not quite as they appear however.
In addition to the Escapist himself, the comic featured stories of other characters supposedly created by Kavalier and Clay, such as the heroine Luna Moth and villains such as the gun-wielding Mr. Machine Gun or The Saboteur.
The Escapist is also sometimes aided by his benefactors, the League of the Golden Key, a secret society dedicated to freeing the oppressed and imprisoned. They are the source of the mystic key that grants the Escapist his powers, having granted it to Tom's uncle after freeing him from kidnappers when he was younger.

Introduced in Chabon's novel in 2000, the Escapist is said to be the creation of the book's protagonists, the cousins Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, a pair of Jewish comic book creators in the 1930s and 1940s. The character's modus operandi is part of a recurring theme of escapism in the novel, representing the imaginative and positive effects of escapism in superhero comics as well as Kavalier and Clay's attempts to escape from the troubles of their past.[3] Joe Kavalier has fled to America from Nazi-occupied Prague in Europe, leaving the rest of his family behind. Unable to help them, he starts fleeing from himself and everyone trying to get close to him. Sam Clay also wants to escape from himself – both his polio-stricken body and repressed homosexuality.
Within the story, the Escapist makes his first appearance in Amazing Midget Radio Comics #1,[4] published by Empire Comics, a former novelty device company.[5] He provides Kavalier and Clay with a measure of success and fame. However, having signed the rights to the character to the publisher, they make comparatively little from the massively successful character.
In 2004, Chabon teamed with Dark Horse Comics to create an actual comic book series of the Escapist. Named Michael Chabon Presents the Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, the comic chronicled the supposed decades-long publishing history of the character. The stories and text pieces were written with the concept that Kavalier and Clay were real people and that the Escapist had actually been a character from the Golden Age of Comics. As such, the stories in the anthology were frequently written and drawn in older or simpler styles, in homage to the comics of past eras.
