This type of surgery is not available on the NHS and can be expensive.
To check if you or your child is short-sighted, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test.

It's not clear why short-sightedness happens and it's hard to prevent it.
You'll be asked to look at a light or read letters on a chart while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes.
Short-sightedness often runs in families, so you may have relatives who are also short-sighted.
a lazy eye – where sight in 1 eye does not develop properly
Short-sightedness (myopia) is a very common eye condition where you cannot see objects far away clearly. It's usually corrected with glasses or contact lenses.
It can get worse until the eye has stopped growing, at around 20 years of age.
Short-sightedness can usually be treated with glasses or contact lenses.
if you're on some benefits, including Income Support and Universal Credit
But there are some things that can help stop it getting worse.
Some opticians may advise wearing a special lens overnight (orthokeratology). This can help you see better without glasses or contact lenses.
cataracts – cloudy patches inside the lens of the eye
lens surgery to replace the lenses in your eyes with artificial lenses
you or your child has not had an eye test for 2 years
Young children with untreated short-sightedness are more likely to get other conditions, such as:
Glasses are suitable for children and adults. Contact lenses are only suitable for adults and some children
Some adults with severe short sight-sightedness are more likely to develop:
a squint – where the eyes point in different directions
An optician will advise you about the best option for your short-sightedness.
Some people are entitled to a voucher to help towards the cost of glasses or contact lenses (NHS optical voucher), including:
Short-sightedness usually starts in children from age 6 to 13. It can also happen in adults.
To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given special eyedrops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly.
These help your eyes focus correctly, so you can see distant objects more clearly.

In Australia, the overall prevalence of myopia (worse than −0.50 diopters) has been estimated to be 17%.[121] In one recent study, less than one in 10 (8%) Australian children between the ages of four and 12 were found to have myopia greater than −0.50 diopters.[122] A recent review found 16% of Australians aged 40 or over have at least −1.00 diopters of myopia and 3% have at least −5.00 diopters.[118]

Youth onset myopia occurs in early childhood or teenage, and the ocular power can keep varying until the age of 21, before which any form of corrective surgery is usually not recommended by ophthalmic specialists around the world.[54]
Simple myopia: Myopia in an otherwise normal eye, typically less than 4.00 to 6.00 diopters.[54] This is the most common form of myopia.
A diagnosis of myopia is typically made by an eye care professional, usually an optometrist or ophthalmologist. During a refraction, an autorefractor or retinoscope is used to give an initial objective assessment of the refractive status of each eye, then a phoropter is used to subjectively refine the patient's eyeglass prescription. Other types of refractive error are hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia.[1]

The underlying cause is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[2] Risk factors include doing work that involves focusing on close objects, greater time spent indoors, urbanization, and a family history of the condition.[2][3][18][19] It is also associated with a high socioeconomic class and higher level of education.[2][19]

A near-sighted individual can see clearly out to a certain distance (the far point of the eye), but objects placed beyond this distance appear blurred. If the extent of the myopia is great enough, even standard reading distances can be affected. Upon routine examination of the eyes, the vast majority of myopic eyes appear structurally identical to nonmyopic eyes.[citation needed]

Global refractive errors have been estimated to affect 800 million to 2.3 billion.[103] The incidence of myopia within sampled population often varies with age, country, sex, race, ethnicity, occupation, environment, and other factors.[104][105] Variability in testing and data collection methods makes comparisons of prevalence and progression difficult.[106]

A risk for myopia may be inherited from one's parents.[25] Genetic linkage studies have identified 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes that are associated with myopia, but none of these loci is part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia.[26] A collaboration of all myopia studies worldwide identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, ion transport, retinoic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development. The carriers of the high-risk genes have a tenfold increased risk of myopia.[27] Aberrant genetic recombination and gene splicing in the OPNLW1 and OPNMW1 genes that code for two retinal cone photopigment proteins can produce high myopia by interfering with refractive development of the eye..mw-parser-output .ambox{border:1px solid #a2a9b1;border-left:10px solid #36c;background-color:#fbfbfb;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+link+.ambox{margin-top:-1px}html body.mediawiki .mw-parser-output .ambox.mbox-small-left{margin:4px 1em 4px 0;overflow:hidden;width:238px;border-collapse:collapse;font-size:88%;line-height:1.25em}.mw-parser-output .ambox-speedy{border-left:10px solid #b32424;background-color:#fee7e6}.mw-parser-output .ambox-delete{border-left:10px solid #b32424}.mw-parser-output .ambox-content{border-left:10px solid #f28500}.mw-parser-output .ambox-style{border-left:10px solid #fc3}.mw-parser-output .ambox-move{border-left:10px solid #9932cc}.mw-parser-output .ambox-protection{border-left:10px solid #a2a9b1}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-text{border:none;padding:0.25em 0.5em;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image{border:none;padding:2px 0 2px 0.5em;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-imageright{border:none;padding:2px 0.5em 2px 0;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-empty-cell{border:none;padding:0;width:1px}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image-div{width:52px}html.client-js body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .mbox-text-span{margin-left:23px!important}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .ambox{margin:0 10%}}

Various methods have been employed in an attempt to decrease the progression of myopia, although studies show mixed results.[77] Many myopia treatment studies have a number of design drawbacks: small numbers, lack of adequate control group, and failure to mask examiners from knowledge of treatments used. Among myopia specialists, mydriatic eyedrops are the most favored approach, applied by almost 75% in North America and more than 80% in Australia[citation needed]. A 2015 review suggested that increased outdoor time protects young children from myopia.[7] A 2020 study of global practice patterns used by paediatric ophthalmologists to decrease the progression of myopia showed behavioral intervention (counseling to spend more time outdoors and less time with near-work) to be favored by 25% of specialists, usually in addition to medications.[78]

Anti-muscarinic topical medications in children under 18 years of age may slow the worsening of myopia.[82][83] These treatments include pirenzepine gel, cyclopentolate eye drops, and atropine eye drops. While these treatments were shown to be effective in slowing the progression of myopia, side effects included light sensitivity and near blur.[82]

The difference between the near-sighted and far-sighted people was noted already by Aristotle.[125] Graeco-Roman physician Galen first used the term "myopia" (from Greek words "myein" meaning "to close or shut" and "ops" (gen. opos) meaning "eye") for near-sightedness.[125] The first spectacles for correcting myopia were invented by a German cardinal in the year 1451.[126] Johannes Kepler in his Clarification of Ophthalmic Dioptrics (1604) first demonstrated that near-sightedness was due to the incident light focusing in front of the retina. Kepler also showed that near-sightedness could be corrected by concave lenses.[125] In 1632, Vopiscus Fortunatus Plempius examined a myopic eye and confirmed that myopia was due to a lengthening of its axial diameter.[127]

A recent review found 25% of Americans aged 40 or over have at least −1.00 diopters of myopia and 5% have at least −5.00 diopters.[118]
Instead of modifying the corneal surface, as in laser vision correction (LVC), this procedure involves implanting an additional lens inside the eye (i.e., in addition to the already existing natural lens). While it usually results in good control of the refractive change, it can induce potential serious long-term complications such as glaucoma, cataract and endothelial decompensation.[90][91][92]

Curvature myopia is attributed to excessive, or increased, curvature of one or more of the refractive surfaces of the eye, especially the cornea.[48] In those with Cohen syndrome, myopia appears to result from high corneal and lenticular power.[49]

Degenerative myopia, also known as malignant, pathological, or progressive myopia, is characterized by marked fundus changes, such as posterior staphyloma, and associated with a high refractive error and subnormal visual acuity after correction.[48] This form of myopia gets progressively worse over time. Degenerative myopia has been reported as one of the main causes of visual impairment.[55]
As with any optical system experiencing a defocus aberration, the effect can be exaggerated or masked by changing the aperture size. In the case of the eye, a large pupil emphasizes refractive error and a small pupil masks it. This phenomenon can cause a condition in which an individual has a greater difficulty seeing in low-illumination areas, even though there are no symptoms in bright light, such as daylight.[50]
Moderate myopia usually describes myopia between −3.00 and −6.00 diopters.[48] Those with moderate amounts of myopia are more likely to have pigment dispersion syndrome or pigmentary glaucoma.[66]
A 2012 review could not find strong evidence for any single cause, although many theories have been discredited.[20] Twin studies indicate that at least some genetic factors are involved.[17][21][22] Myopia has been increasing rapidly throughout the developed world, suggesting environmental factors are involved.[23]

Tentative evidence indicates that the risk of near-sightedness can be decreased by having young children spend more time outside.[7][8] This decrease in risk may be related to natural light exposure.[9] Near-sightedness can be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or a refractive surgery.[1] Eyeglasses are the easiest and safest method of correction.[1] Contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision, but are associated with a risk of infection.[1] Refractive surgery permanently changes the shape of the cornea.[1]

Myopia is common in the United States, with research suggesting this condition has increased dramatically in recent decades. In 1971–1972, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided the earliest nationally representative estimates for myopia prevalence in the U.S., and found the prevalence in persons aged 12–54 was 25%. Using the same method, in 1999–2004, myopia prevalence was estimated to have climbed to 42%.[119]

Corrective lenses bend the light entering the eye in a way that places a focused image accurately onto the retina. The power of any lens system can be expressed in diopters, the reciprocal of its focal length in meters. Corrective lenses for myopia have negative powers because a divergent lens is required to move the far point of focus out to the distance. More severe myopia needs lens powers further from zero (more negative). However, strong eyeglass prescriptions create distortions such as prismatic movement and chromatic aberration. Strongly near-sighted wearers of contact lenses do not experience these distortions because the lens moves with the cornea, keeping the optic axis in line with the visual axis and because the vertex distance has been reduced to zero.[citation needed]

High myopia usually describes myopia of −6.00 or more.[48][67] People with high myopia are more likely to have retinal detachments[68] and primary open angle glaucoma.[69] They are also more likely to experience floaters, shadow-like shapes which appear in the field of vision.[70] In addition to this, high myopia is linked to macular degeneration, cataracts, and significant visual impairment.[71][72][73][74]
Myopia can be induced with minus spherical lenses,[43] and overminus in prescription lenses can induce myopia progression.[44][45] Overminus during refraction can be avoided through various techniques and tests, such as fogging, plus to blur, and the duochrome test.[45]
The Intrastromal corneal ring segment (ICRS), commonly used in keratoconus treatment now, was originally designed to correct mild to moderate myopia.[98] The thickness is directly related to flattening and the diameter of the ring is proportionally inverse to the flattening of cornea. So, if diameter is smaller or thickness is greater, resulting myopia correction will be greater.[99]

Near-sightedness, also known as myopia and short-sightedness, is an eye disease[5] where light focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina.[1][2] As a result, distant objects appear blurry while close objects appear normal.[1] Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain.[1] Severe near-sightedness is associated with an increased risk of retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.[2]

Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) involves ablation of corneal tissue from the corneal surface using an excimer laser. The amount of tissue ablation corresponds to the amount of myopia. While PRK is a relatively safe procedure for up to 6 dioptres of myopia, the recovery phase post-surgery is usually painful.[86][87]

Form deprivation myopia occurs when the eyesight is deprived by limited illumination and vision range,[61] or the eye is modified with artificial lenses[62] or deprived of clear form vision.[63] In lower vertebrates, this kind of myopia seems to be reversible within short periods of time. Myopia is often induced this way in various animal models to study the pathogenesis and mechanism of myopia development.[64]
The near work hypothesis, also referred to as the "use-abuse theory" states that spending time involved in near work strains the intraocular and extraocular muscles. Some studies support the hypothesis, while other studies do not.[3] While an association is present, it is not clearly causal.[3]

One hypothesis is that a lack of normal visual stimuli causes improper development of the eyeball. Under this hypothesis, "normal" refers to the environmental stimuli that the eyeball evolved to.[35] Modern humans who spend most of their time indoors, in dimly or fluorescently lit buildings may be at risk of development of myopia.[35]
Numerous studies have found correlations between myopia, on the one hand, and intelligence and academic achievement, on the other;[130] it is not clear whether there is a causal relationship.[131]Myopia is also correlated with increased microsaccade amplitude, suggesting that blurred vision from myopia might cause instability in fixational eye movements.[132][133]

People, and children especially, who spend more time doing physical exercise and outdoor play have lower rates of myopia,[36][35][37][38][39] suggesting the increased magnitude and complexity of the visual stimuli encountered during these types of activities decrease myopic progression. There is preliminary evidence that the protective effect of outdoor activities on the development of myopia is due, at least in part, to the effect of long hours of exposure to daylight on the production and the release of retinal dopamine.[23][40][41][42]
The degree of myopia is described in terms of the power of the ideal correction, which is measured in diopters:[65]

Near-sightedness is the most common eye problem and is estimated to affect 1.5 billion people (22% of the world population).[2][4] Rates vary significantly in different areas of the world.[2] Rates among adults are between 15% to 49%.[3][10] Among children, it affects 1% of rural Nepalese, 4% of South Africans, 12% of people in the US, and 37% in some large Chinese cities.[2][3] In China the proportion of girls is slightly higher than boys.[11] Rates have increased since the 1950s.[10] Uncorrected near-sightedness is one of the most common causes of vision impairment globally along with cataracts, macular degeneration, and vitamin A deficiency.[10]

Human population studies suggest that contribution of genetic factors accounts for 60–90% of variance in refraction.[30][31][32][33] However, the currently identified variants account for only a small fraction of myopia cases, suggesting the existence of a large number of yet unidentified low-frequency or small-effect variants, which underlie the majority of myopia cases.[34]

Nearsightedness is also more common in children with diabetes, childhood arthritis, uveitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.[17]
The use of reading glasses when doing close work may improve vision by reducing or eliminating the need to accommodate. Altering the use of eyeglasses between full-time, part-time, and not at all does not appear to alter myopia progression.[79][80] The American Optometric Association's Clinical Practice Guidelines found evidence of effectiveness of bifocal lenses and recommends it as the method for "myopia control".[54] In some studies, bifocal and progressive lenses have not shown differences in altering the progression of myopia compared to placebo.[77]

Scleral reinforcement surgery is aimed to cover the thinning posterior pole with a supportive material to withstand intraocular pressure and prevent further progression of the posterior staphyloma. The strain is reduced, although damage from the pathological process cannot be reversed. By stopping the progression of the disease, vision may be maintained or improved.[84]

A study of 2,523 children in grades 1 to 8 (age, 5–17 years) found nearly one in 10 (9%) have at least −0.75 diopters of myopia.[120] In this study, 13% had at least +1.25 D hyperopia (farsightedness), and 28% had at least 1.00-D difference between the two principal meridians (cycloplegic autorefraction) of astigmatism. For myopia, Asians had the highest prevalence (19%), followed by Hispanics (13%). Caucasian children had the lowest prevalence of myopia (4%), which was not significantly different from African Americans (7%).[120]
School myopia appears during childhood, particularly the school-age years.[75] This form of myopia is attributed to the use of the eyes for close work during the school years.[48] A 2004-2015 Singapore-Sydney study of children of Chinese descent found that time spent on outdoor activities was a factor.[76]

In a LASIK pre-procedure, a corneal flap is cut into the cornea and lifted to allow the excimer laser beam access to the exposed corneal tissue. After that, the excimer laser ablates the tissue according to the required correction. When the flap again covers the cornea, the change in curvature generated by the laser ablation proceeds to the corneal surface. Though LASIK is usually painless and involves a short rehabilitation period post-surgery, it can potentially result in flap complications and loss of corneal stability (post-LASIK keratectasia).[88][89]

Orthokeratology or simply Ortho-K is a temporary corneal reshaping process using rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses.[93] Overnight wearing of specially designed contact lenses will temporarily reshape cornea, so patients may see clearly without any lenses in daytime. Orthokeratology can correct myopia up to -6D.[94] Several studies shown that Ortho-K can reduce myopia progression also.[95][96] Risk factors of using Ortho-K lenses include microbial keratitis,[95] corneal edema,[97] etc. Other contact lens related complications like corneal aberration, photophobia, pain, irritation, redness etc. are usually temporary conditions, which may be eliminated by proper usage of lenses.[97]

A number of alternative therapies have been claimed to improve myopia, including vision therapy, "behavioural optometry", various eye exercises and relaxation techniques, and the Bates method.[100] Scientific reviews have concluded that there was "no clear scientific evidence" that eye exercises are effective in treating near-sightedness[101] and as such they "cannot be advocated".[102]

The prevalence of myopia has been reported as high as 70–90% in some Asian countries, 30–40% in Europe and the United States, and 10–20% in Africa.[105] Myopia is about twice as common in Jewish people than in people of non-Jewish ethnicity.[107] Myopia is less common in African people and associated diaspora.[104] In Americans between the ages of 12 and 54, myopia has been found to affect African Americans less than Caucasians.[108]

Induced myopia, also known as acquired myopia, results from various medications, increases in glucose levels, nuclear sclerosis, oxygen toxicity (e.g., from diving or from oxygen and hyperbaric therapy) or other anomalous conditions.[54] Sulphonamide therapy can cause ciliary body edema, resulting in anterior displacement of the lens, pushing the eye out of focus.[51] Elevation of blood-glucose levels can also cause edema (swelling) of the crystalline lens as a result of sorbitol accumulating in the lens. This edema often causes temporary myopia. Scleral buckles, used in the repair of retinal detachments may induce myopia by increasing the axial length of the eye.[59]

The underlying mechanism involves the length of the eyeball growing too long or less commonly the lens being too strong.[1][6] It is a type of refractive error.[1] Diagnosis is by eye examination.[1]

The National Institutes of Health says there is no known way of preventing myopia, and the use of glasses or contact lenses does not affect its progression, unless the glasses or contact lenses are too strong of a prescription.[85] There is no universally accepted method of preventing myopia and proposed methods need additional study to determine their effectiveness.[54] Optical correction using glasses or contact lenses is the most common treatment; other approaches include orthokeratology, and refractive surgery.[54]: 21–26  Medications (mostly atropine) and vision therapy can be effective in addressing the various forms of pseudomyopia.[citation needed]
