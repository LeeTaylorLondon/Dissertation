Dominating set – Subset of a graph's nodes such that all other nodes link to at least one

A k-dominating set is a set of vertices such that each vertex not in the set has at least k neighbors in the set (a standard dominating set is a 1-dominating set). Similarly, a k-tuple dominating set is a set of vertices such that each vertex in the graph has at least k neighbors in the set (a total dominating set is a 1-tuple dominating set). An (1 + log n)-approximation of a minimum k-tuple dominating set can be found in polynomial time.[3] Every graph admits a k-dominating set (for example, the set of all vertices); but only graphs with minimum degree k − 1 admit a k-tuple dominating set. However, even if the graph admits k-tuple dominating set, a minimum k-tuple dominating set can be nearly k times as large as a minimum k-dominating set for the same graph;[4] An (1.7 + log Δ)-approximation of a minimum k-dominating set can be found in polynomial time as well.

A graph G is called a domination-perfect graph if γ(H) = i(H) in every induced subgraph H of G. Since an induced subgraph of a claw-free graph is claw-free, it follows that every claw-free graphs is also domination-perfect.[7]
A domatic partition is a partition of the vertices into disjoint dominating sets. The domatic number is the maximum size of a domatic partition.
The inequality can be strict - there are graphs G for which γ(G)  1.The edges of G are defined as follows: each xi is adjacent to a, a is adjacent to b, and b is adjacent to each yj.Then γ(G) = 2 since {a, b}is a smallest dominating set.If p ≤ q, then i(G) = p + 1 since {x1,…,xp,b}{\displaystyle \{x_{1},\ldots ,x_{p},b\}} is a smallest dominating set that is also independent (it is a smallest maximal independent set).

The inequality can be strict - there are graphs G for which iγ(G) < γ(G).For example, for some integer n, let G be a graph in which the vertices are the rows and columns of an n-by-n board, and two such vertices are connected if and only if they intersect. The only independent sets are sets of only rows or sets of only columns, and each of them can be dominated by a single vertex (a column or a row), so iγ(G) = 1. However, to dominate all vertices we need at least one row and one column, so γ(G) = 2.Moreover, the ratio between γ(G) / iγ(G) can be arbitrarily large. For example, if the vertices of G are all the subsets of squares of an n-by-n board, then still iγ(G) = 1, but γ(G) = n.[8]

On the other hand, if the input graph is planar, the problem remains NP-hard, but a fixed-parameter algorithm is known. In fact, the problem has a kernel of size linear in k,[18] and running times that are exponential in √k and cubic in n may be obtained by applying dynamic programming to a branch-decomposition of the kernel.[19] More generally, the dominating set problem and many variants of the problem are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by both the size of the dominating set and the size of the smallest forbidden complete bipartite subgraph; that is, the problem is FPT on biclique-free graphs, a very general class of sparse graphs that includes the planar graphs.[20]

Let (S, U) be an instance of the set cover problem with the universe U and the family of subsets S = {Si : i ∈ I}; we assume that U and the index set I are disjoint. Construct a graph G = (V, E) as follows: the set of vertices is V = I ∪ U, there is an edge {i, j} ∈ E between each pair i, j ∈ I, and there is also an edge {i, u}for each i ∈ I and u ∈ Si. That is, G is a split graph: I is a clique and U is an independent set.

Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), a subset of vertices D⊆V{\displaystyle D\subseteq V} is called a dominating set if for every vertex u∈V∖D{\displaystyle u\in V\setminus D}, there is a vertex v∈D{\displaystyle v\in D} such that (u,v)∈E{\displaystyle (u,v)\in E}.

A dominating edge-set is a set of edges (vertex pairs) whose union is a dominating set; such a set may not exist (for example, a graph with one or more vertices and no edges does not have it). If it exists, then the union of all its edges is a strongly-dominating set. Therefore, the smallest size of an edge-dominating set is at least γstrong(G)/2{\displaystyle \gamma ^{strong}(G)/2}.

An eternal dominating set is a dynamic version of domination in which a vertex v in dominating set D is chosen and replaced with a neighbor u (u is not in D) such that the modified D is also a dominating set and this process can be repeated over any infinite sequence of choices of vertices v.
Every graph has at least one dominating set: if D=V={\displaystyle D=V=} the set of all vertices, then by definition D is a dominating set, since there is no vertex u∈V∖D{\displaystyle u\in V\setminus D}. A more interesting challenge is to find small dominating sets. The domination number of G is defined as:γ(G):=min{|D|:D is a dominating set of G}{\displaystyle \gamma (G):=\min\{|D|:D{\text{ is a dominating set of }}G\}}.
Now if C = {Si : i ∈ D} is a feasible solution of the set cover problem for some subset D ⊆ I, then D is a dominating set for G, with |D| = |C|: First, for each u ∈ U there is an i ∈ D such that u ∈ Si, and by construction, u and i are adjacent in G; hence u is dominated by i. Second, since D must be nonempty, each i ∈ I is adjacent to a vertex in D.
Dominating sets are closely related to independent sets: an independent set is also a dominating set if and only if it is a maximal independent set, so any maximal independent set in a graph is necessarily also a minimal dominating set.
A star-dominating setis a subset D of V such that, for every vertex v in V, the star of v (the set of edges adjacent to v) intersects the star of some vertex in D. Clearly, if G has isolated vertices then it has no star-dominating sets (since the star of isolated vertices is empty). If G has no isolated vertices, then every dominating set is a star-dominating set and vice versa. The distinction between star-domination and usual domination is more substantial when their fractional variants are considered.[5]

Finding a dominating set of size k plays a central role in the theory of parameterized complexity. It is the most well-known problem complete for the class W[2]and used in many reductions to show intractability of other problems. In particular, the problem is not fixed-parameter tractable in the sense that no algorithm with running time f(k)nO(1) for any function f exists unless the W-hierarchy collapses to FPT=W[2].
The complementary set to a dominating set, a nonblocker, can be found by a fixed-parameter algorithm on any graph.[21]
Hence the size of a minimum dominating set for G equals the size of a minimum set cover for (U, S). Furthermore, there is a simple algorithm that maps a dominating set to a set cover of the same size and vice versa. In particular, an efficient α-approximation algorithm for set covering provides an efficient α-approximation algorithm for minimum dominating sets.

The following two reductions show that the minimum dominating set problem and the set cover problem are equivalent under L-reductions: given an instance of one problem, we can construct an equivalent instance of the other problem.[10]
The set cover problem is a well-known NP-hard problem – the decision version of set covering was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. There exist a pair of polynomial-time L-reductions between the minimum dominating set problem and the set cover problem.[10] These reductions (see below) show that an efficient algorithm for the minimum dominating set problem would provide an efficient algorithm for the set cover problem, and vice versa. Moreover, the reductions preserve the approximation ratio: for any α, a polynomial-time α-approximation algorithm for minimum dominating sets would provide a polynomial-time α-approximation algorithm for the set cover problem and vice versa. Both problems are in fact Log-APX-complete.[11]
For any graph G, its line graph L(G) is claw-free, and hence a minimum maximal independent set in L(G) is also a minimum dominating set in L(G). An independent set in L(G) corresponds to a matching in G, and a dominating set in L(G) corresponds to an edge dominating set in G. Therefore a minimum maximal matching has the same size as a minimum edge dominating set.
Conversely, let D be a dominating set for G. Then it is possible to construct another dominating set X such that |X| ≤ |D| and X ⊆ I: simply replace each u ∈ D ∩ U by a neighbour i ∈ I of u. Then C = {Si : i ∈ X} is a feasible solution of the set cover problem, with |C| = |X| ≤ |D|.
A connected dominating set is a dominating set that is also connected. If S is a connected dominating set, one can form a spanning tree of G in which S forms the set of non-leaf vertices of the tree; conversely, if T is any spanning tree in a graph with more than two vertices, the non-leaf vertices of T form a connected dominating set. Therefore, finding minimum connected dominating sets is equivalent to finding spanning trees with the maximum possible number of leaves.

A minimum dominating set of an n-vertex graph can be found in time O(2nn) by inspecting all vertex subsets. Fomin, Grandoni & Kratsch (2009) show how to find a minimum dominating set in time O(1.5137n) and exponential space, and in time O(1.5264n) and polynomial space. A faster algorithm, using O(1.5048n) time was found by van Rooij, Nederlof & van Dijk (2009), who also show that the number of minimum dominating sets can be computed in this time.The number of minimal dominating sets is at most 1.7159n and all such sets can be listed in timeO(1.7159n).[17]
The dominating set problem concerns testing whether γ(G) ≤ K for a given graph G and input K; it is a classical NP-complete decision problem in computational complexity theory.[1] Therefore it is believed that there may be no efficient algorithm that can compute γ(G) for all graphs G. However, there are efficient approximation algorithms, as well as efficient exact algorithms for certain graph classes.

The independent domination number i(G) of a graph G is the size of the smallest dominating set that is an independent set. Equivalently, it is the size of the smallest maximal independent set. The minimum in i(G) is taken over less elements (only the independent sets are considered), so γ(G) ≤ i(G) for all graphs G.

There are graph families in which γ(G) = i(G), that is, every minimum maximal independent set is a minimum dominating set. For example, γ(G) = i(G) if G is a claw-free graph.[6]
A total dominating set (or strongly-dominating set) is a set of vertices such that all vertices in the graph, including the vertices in the dominating set themselves, have a neighbor in the dominating set.[2] That is: for every vertex u∈V{\displaystyle u\in V}, there is a vertex v∈D{\displaystyle v\in D} such that (u,v)∈E{\displaystyle (u,v)\in E}. Figure (c) above shows a dominating set that is a connected dominating set and a total dominating set; the examples in figures (a) and (b) are neither. In contrast to a simple dominating set, a total dominating set may not exist. For example, a graph with one or more vertices and no edges does not have a total dominating set. The strong domination number of G is defined as:γstrong(G):=min{|D|:D is a strongly-dominating set of G}{\displaystyle \gamma ^{strong}(G):=\min\{|D|:D{\text{ is a strongly-dominating set of }}G\}}; obviously, γstrong(G)≥γ(G){\displaystyle \gamma ^{strong}(G)\geq \gamma (G)}.

The independence domination number iγ(G) of a graph G is the maximum, over all independent sets A of G, of the smallest set dominating A.[8] Dominating subsets of vertices requires potentially less vertices than dominating all vertices, so iγ(G) ≤ γ(G) for all graphs G.
Now if D is a dominating set for G, then C = {Sv : v ∈ D} is a feasible solution of the set cover problem, with |C| = |D|. Conversely, if C = {Sv : v ∈ D} is a feasible solution of the set cover problem, then D is a dominating set for G, with |D| = |C|.
If the graph has maximum degree Δ, then the greedy approximation algorithm finds an O(log Δ)-approximation of a minimum dominating set. Also, let dg be the cardinality of dominating set obtained using greedy approximation then following relation holds, dg≤N+1−2M+1{\displaystyle d_{g}\leq N+1-{\sqrt {2M+1}}}, where N is number of nodes and M is number of edges in given undirected graph.[13] For fixed Δ, this qualifies as a dominating set for APX membership; in fact, it is APX-complete.[14]
In contrast, an edge-dominating set is a set D of edges, such that every edge not in D is adjacent to at least one edge in D; such a set always exists (for example, the set of all edges is an edge-dominating set).
In graph theory, a dominating set for a graph G is a subset D of its vertices, such that any vertex of G is either in D, or has a neighbor in D. The domination number γ(G) is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set for G.

The problem admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for special cases such as unit disk graphs and planar graphs.[15] A minimum dominating set can be found in linear time in series–parallel graphs.[16]
The approximability of set covering is also well understood: a logarithmic approximation factor can be found by using a simple greedy algorithm, and finding a sublogarithmic approximation factor is NP-hard. More specifically, the greedy algorithm provides a factor 1 + log|V| approximation of a minimum dominating set, and no polynomial time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better than c log|V| for some c > 0 unless P = NP.[12]

The domination problem was studied from the 1950s onwards, but the rate of research on domination significantly increased in the mid-1970s. In 1972, Richard Karp proved the set cover problem to be NP-complete. This had immediate implications for the dominating set problem, as there are straightforward vertex to set and edge to non-disjoint-intersection bijections between the two problems. This proved the dominating set problem to be NP-complete as well.[9]

Dominating sets are of practical interest in several areas. In wireless networking, dominating sets are used to find efficient routes within ad-hoc mobile networks. They have also been used in document summarization, and in designing secure systems for electrical grids.

Given a graph G = (V, E) with V = {1, 2, ..., n}, construct a set cover instance (U, S) as follows: the universe U is V, and the family of subsets is S = {S1, S2, ..., Sn} such that Sv consists of the vertex v and all vertices adjacent to v in G.
B is strictly dominated by A: choosing B always gives a worse outcome than choosing A, no matter what the other player(s) do. (Strategy A strictly dominates B).
There are instances when there is no pure strategy that dominates another pure strategy, but a mixture of two or more pure strategies can dominate another strategy. This is called Strictly Dominant Mixed Strategies. Some authors allow for elimination of strategies dominated by a mixed strategy in this way.

Strictly dominated strategies cannot be a part of a Nash equilibrium, and as such, it is irrational for any player to play them.On the other hand, weakly dominated strategies may be part of Nash equilibria.For instance, consider the payoff matrix pictured at the right.
Of the remaining strategies (see IESDS Figure 4), Y is strictly dominated by X for Player 2. Therefore, Player 2 will never play Y. Player 1 knows this.
We can demonstrate the same methods on a more complex game and solve for the rational strategies. In this scenario, the blue coloring represents the dominating numbers in the particular strategy.

C is strictly dominated by A for Player 1. Therefore, Player 1 will never play strategy C. Player 2 knows this. (see IESDS Figure 1)
B is weakly dominated by A: there is at least one set of opponents' actions for which B gives a worse outcome than A, while all other sets of opponents' actions give A the same payoff as B. (Strategy A weakly dominates B).
Strategy B is strictly dominated if some other strategy exists that strictly dominates B.

Strategy B is weakly dominated if some other strategy exists that weakly dominates B.
For Player 2, X is dominated by the mixed strategy ½X and ½Z. The expected payoff for playing strategy ½X + ½Z must be greater than the expected payoff for playing pure strategy X, assigning ½ and ½ as tester values. The argument for mixed strategy dominance can be made if there is at least one mixed strategy that allows for dominance.

B strictly dominates A: choosing B always gives a better outcome than choosing A, no matter what the other players do.
In any case, if by iterated elimination of dominated strategies there is only one strategy left for each player, the game is called a dominance-solvable game.
B is equivalent to A: choosing B always gives the same outcome as choosing A, no matter what the other players do.

B and A are intransitive: B and A are not equivalent, and B neither dominates, nor is dominated by, A. Choosing A is better in some cases, while choosing B is better in other cases, depending on exactly how the opponent chooses to play. For example, B is "throw rock" while A is "throw scissors" in Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Common Knowledge: The assumption that each player has knowledge of the game, knows the rules and payoffs associated with each course of action, and realizes that every other player has this same level of understanding. This is the premise that allows a player to make a value judgment on the actions of another player, backed by the assumption of rationality, intoconsideration when selecting an action.[2]
Strategy: A complete contingent plan for a player in the game. A complete contingent plan is a full specification of a player's behavior, describing each action a player would take at every possible decision point. Because information sets represent points in a game where a player must make a decision, a player's strategy describes what that player will do at each information set.[2]
B weakly dominates A: choosing B always gives at least as good an outcome as choosing A, no matter what the other players do, and there is at least one set of opponents' action for which B gives a better outcome than A. (Notice that if B strictly dominates A, then B weakly dominates A. Therefore, we can say "B dominates A" as synonymous of "B weakly dominates A".)[1]
Of the remaining strategies (see IESDS Figure 3), B is strictly dominated by A for Player 1. Therefore, Player 1 will never play B. Player 2 knows this.
When a player tries to choose the "best" strategy among a multitude of options, that player may compare two strategies A and B to see which one is better.The result of the comparison is one of:
Strategy C weakly dominates strategy D.Consider playing C: If one's opponent plays C, one gets 1; if one's opponent plays D, one gets 0.Compare this to D, where one gets 0 regardless.Since in one case, one does better by playing C instead of D and never does worse, C weakly dominates D.Despite this, (D,D){\displaystyle (D,D)} is a Nash equilibrium.Suppose both players choose D.Neither player will do any better by unilaterally deviating—if a player switches to playing C, they will still get 0.This satisfies the requirements of a Nash equilibrium. Suppose both players choose C. Neither player will do better by unilaterally deviating—if a player switches to playing D, they will get 0. This also satisfies the requirements of a Nash equilibrium.
O is strictly dominated by N for Player 1. Therefore, Player 1 will never play strategy O. Player 2 knows this. (see IESDS Figure 6)
This notion can be generalized beyond the comparison of two strategies.
Strategy B is weakly dominant if strategy B weakly dominates every other possible strategy.
Only one rationalizable strategy is left {A,X} which results in a payoff of (10,4). This is the single Nash Equilibrium for this game.
For Player 1, U is dominated by the pure strategy D.
Set up the inequality to determine whether the mixed strategy will dominate the pure strategy based on expected payoffs. u½X + u½Z ⩼ uX 4 + 5 > 5 Mixed strategy ½X and ½Z will dominate pure strategy X for Player 2, and thus X can be eliminated from the rationalizable strategies for P2.
Testing with ½ and ½ gets the following: Expected average payoff of ½ Strategy Y: ½(4+0+4) = 4 Expected average payoff of ½ Strategy Z: ½(0+5+5) = 5 Expected average payoff of pure strategy X: (1+1+3) = 5
Rationality: The assumption that each player acts in a way that is designed to bring about what he or she most prefers given probabilities of various outcomes; von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that if these preferences satisfy certain conditions, this is mathematically equivalent to maximizing a payoff. A straightforward example of maximizing payoff is that of monetary gain, but for the purpose of a game theory analysis, this payoff can take any desired outcome. E.g., cash reward, minimization of exertion or discomfort, promoting justice, or amassing overall “utility” - the assumption of rationality states thatplayers will always act in the way that best satisfies their ordering from best to worst of various possible outcomes.[2]
Strategy B is strictly dominant if strategy B strictly dominates every other possible strategy.
The iterated elimination (or deletion) of dominated strategies (also denominated as IESDS or IDSDS) is one common technique for solving games that involves iteratively removing dominated strategies.In the first step, at most one dominated strategy is removed from the strategy space of each of the players since no rational player would ever play these strategies. This results in a new, smaller game.Some strategies—that were not dominated before—may be dominated in the smaller game.The first step is repeated, creating a new even smaller game, and so on. The process stops when no dominated strategy is found for any player. This process is valid since it is assumed that rationality among players is common knowledge, that is, each player knows that the rest of the players are rational, and each player knows that the rest of the players know that he knows that the rest of the players are rational, and so on ad infinitum (see Aumann, 1976).
O is strictly dominated by N for Player 1. Therefore, Player 1 will never play strategy O. Player 2 knows this. (see IESDS Figure 5)

U is weakly dominated by T for Player 2. If Player 2 chooses T, then the final equilibrium is (N,T)
There are two versions of this process. One version involves only eliminating strictly dominated strategies.If, after completing this process, there is only one strategy for each player remaining, that strategy set is the unique Nash equilibrium.[3]
T is weakly dominated by U for Player 2. If Player 2 chooses U, then the final equilibrium is (N,U)
In this scenario, for player 1, there is no pure strategy that dominates another pure strategy. Let’s define the probability of player 1 playing up as p, and let p = ½. We can set a mixed strategy where player 1 plays up and down with probabilities (½,½). When player 2 plays left, then the payoff for player 1 playing the mixed strategy of up and down is 1, when player 2 plays right, the payoff for player 1 playing the mixed strategy is 0.5. Thus regardless of whether player 2 chooses left or right, player 1 gets more from playing this mixed strategy between up and down than if the player were to play the middle strategy. In this case, we should eliminate the middle strategy for player 1 since it’s been dominated by the mixed strategy of playing up and down with probability (½,½).
For player 2, Y is dominated by the pure strategy Z.

The only rationalizable strategy for Players 1 and 2 is then (M,Z) or (3,5).
Another version involves eliminating both strictly and weakly dominated strategies.If, at the end of the process, there is a single strategy for each player, this strategy set is also a Nash equilibrium.However, unlike the first process, elimination of weakly dominated strategies may eliminate some Nash equilibria.As a result, the Nash equilibrium found by eliminating weakly dominated strategies may not be the only Nash equilibrium. (In some games, if we remove weakly dominated strategies in a different order, we may end up with a different Nash equilibrium.)
If a strictly dominant strategy exists for one player in a game, that player will play that strategy in each of the game's Nash equilibria.If both players have a strictly dominant strategy, the game has only one unique Nash equilibrium, referred to as a "dominant strategy equilibrium". However, that Nash equilibrium is not necessarily "efficient", meaning that there may be non-equilibrium outcomes of the game that would be better for both players.The classic game used to illustrate this is the Prisoner's Dilemma.
