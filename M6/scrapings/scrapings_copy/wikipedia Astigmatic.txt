Astigmatism is defined as the eye creating two images instead of one image on the retina. This happens when the power of the eye isn't the same in all directions, often because the front of the eye (the cornea) is shaped more like the back of a spoon than a perfect sphere. Astigmatism does not affect the health of the eye, and eyes with astigmatism can be perfectly healthy.The result is that objects look blurry, but how much blur is different in different directions, which is why people with astigmatism often have trouble reading some letters but not others.

It can also cause headaches and eyestrain. In most cases it is easily fixed with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery.

Fishbourne I appreciate what you are trying to do here, but we have to remember who we are writing for, and the problem with that edit is that whilst technically correct, it introduces three new terms, "point image" "object point" and "rotational asymmetry" which may be difficult to comprehend for most readers.

I know what a cylinder is, but this article starts using the term like it is a specialized optical concept (which it is) and gives no explanation of it.There is no corresponding Wikipedia article on "Cylinder" or "Cylinder (visual)" that means the kind of cylindrical correction for a contact lens.This article on astigmatism doesn't make this any more clear (as it were).A loose noose (talk) 06:16, 8 May 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Spheres are ellipsoids. This statement does not meaningfully draw a distinction between a healthy cornea and an astigmatic cornea. What actually differentiates spheres and eggs is that eggs are mostly prolate and spheres are neither prolate nor oblate. It is also wrong to say that "ellipsoidal" means "like an egg". An egg is a very special case of an ellipsoid, just as a sphere is.

– When people are looking up information on astigmatism they are looking for the article on the eye condition. If you do a Google search you need to look a long long way down before you find something that is not about the eye. Our pageviews for the eye disease in the last 30 days is 46,000[1] while that for the more general optics topic is 12,000 many of which probably arrived at the wrong page. Google when searching for astigmatism thankfully ranks the eye disease page higher. Doc James (talk · contribs · email) 17:54, 29 September 2016 (UTC)Reply[reply]

The government page on astigmatism http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001015.htmstates that "Glasses or hard contact lenses will correct astigmatism. Soft contact lenses do not work as well."I have a 180 degree axis in one eye and a 170 degree axis in the other eye and am able to use softmed torics which are soft lenses.The doctor told me that those would be better than buying hard lenses.I have no problems wearing them or seeing with them and my astigmatism is horrible.I'm wondering too if there is any genetic basis for having astigmatism.My mother also has a huge axis on both eyes. --Starladustangel 05:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]

What is the future impact of astigmatism for a patient?
— Preceding unsigned comment added by 115.248.157.91 (talk) 06:58, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
The article says "In With-the-rule astigmatism, the eye sees vertical lines more sharply than horizontal lines. Against-the-rule astigmatism reverses the situation. " Is this correct? It seems that it depends on the spherical refraction/acommodation what axis is seen sharper. Depending on the spherical focal distance, in either case (with or against the rule) one or the other orientation could be seen sharp. If the total spherical equivalent matches the object distance, neither axis will be seen sharp. Can anyone confirm? 193.196.193.20 (talk) 14:52, 15 June 2011 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Let's say that, to the patient, for the right eye the prescription is 1.5 diopters at 15 degrees clockwise and 0.75 diopters at 105 degrees clockwise.I would know what to tell a lens grinder but I would not know how this is specified by an optician or by an ophthalmologist.Please clarify this and give an example for the reader.I am asking this question because I am about to have my cataracts removed and want to know what my prescription will be if I have a Basic lens put in my astigmatic eye or if I have a near lens put in.Because this article is so imprecise, I would rate this as poor.The problem likely is that the authors are so well-versed in the area that they don't realize that others need their conventions specified.For the record, I am a physicist and occasionally have taught introductory optics.

I recently went to have my eyes checked and was told that I have astigmatism, albeit "just a little." He came to his conclusion based on a series of tests with white superimposed on green and red backgrounds. I observed the letters through a phoropter. I was asked which letters appeared clearer: the ones superimposed on the green or red background? This does not appear to be a reasonable test for astigmatism. If I am not mistaken, shouldn't an astigmatism chart be used if one was to diagnose astigmatism? Anyone have any ideas? mezzaninelounge 14:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]
The Alpins method of astigmatism analysis is a new entry, currently listed as an orphan. It forms the basis for ANSI standards related to planning/analysis of astigmatism correction in refractive surgery (a new section that will soon be added). It includes a link to Astigmatism (eye); can I insert a link in Astigmatism (eye) back to the Alpins method (not sure of the protocol here, as I'm new to this). Thanks.
