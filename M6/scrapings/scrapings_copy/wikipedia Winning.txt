Longest winning streak (male or female) in Tennis is 181 matches. It is held by French tennis player Suzanne Lenglen.
Italy holds the current unbeaten record of 37 matches, followed by Argentina with 36, and then Spain, Brazil and Algeria with 35 games each. Brazil's loss at the 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup was by the under-23 (Olympic) team, but is officially counted as a loss of the national team.[76] Otherwise the Brazil national team wouldn't lose until May 30, 1997 (2–4 vs Norway), thus extending the streak to 42 games. Brazil lost the 27th match of their streak on penalties in the 1995 Copa América Final on July 22, 1995, but this is considered a draw in regular play.

Note:Because of the post-1972 schedule overhaul, NASCAR will differentiate records from pre-1972 and post-1972.The primary schedule overhaul eliminated midweek races, thus cutting the schedule from 48 to around 30 races (36 currently), and a minimum race distance (first 250 miles (400 km), later shortened to 300 km (190 mi)).Since many pre-1972 races were under 100 miles (such as 62.5 mile races held in Islip, New York, and the current non-championship Budweiser Duel then being a championship race at 100 miles until 1967), some NASCAR records are differentiated that way, similar to the NBA differentiating "fewest points" records with pre and post-1954 records, when the 24-second shot clock was introduced.

A winning streak, also known as a win streak or hot streak, is an uninterrupted sequence of success in games or competitions, commonly measured by at least 2 wins that are uninterrupted by losses or ties/draws. In sports, it can be applied to teams, and individuals. In sports where teams or individuals represent groups such as countries or regions, those groups can also be said to have winning streaks if their representatives win consecutive games or competitions, even if the competitors are different. Streaks can also be applied to specific competitions: for example, a competitor who wins an event in three consecutive Olympic Games has an Olympic winning streak, even if they have lost other competitions during the period.

Winner (Korean: 위너; romanized: wineo; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean boy band consisting of four members: Jinu, Hoony, Mino and Seungyoon. The band was formed in 2013 by YG Entertainment through Mnet's survival program WIN: Who Is Next leading to their official debut on August 17, 2014, with studio album 2014 S/S. Originally a five-piece band, Taehyun, departed from the group in November 2016 for his mental health and well-being. Upon their debut, The Korea Herald cited their immediate success as "unprecedented" for a new group, thus dubbed as "Monster rookies". Winner is often cited as a "self-producing" band with all members actively taking on roles from producing and choreographing to designing and marketing. The band also earned the titles "Trust and Listen" alongside "Kings of Summer" by media outlets and the general public through releases.
