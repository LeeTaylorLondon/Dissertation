Lorde debuted "Sober" at a "tiny pre-Coachella gig" to a crowd of 240 at Pappy & Harriet's on 15 April 2017. Tickets sold out in minutes.[22] Eve Barlow from Billboard praised the performance, saying that it was "heartwarming to watch Lorde engage with such easy confidence" on stage, noting her growth in her level of comfort with the crowd.[23] She also performed the song at the Governors Ball on 2 June 2017. During the performance, a tilted box was used, pointing downward. At the end, the box opens and Lorde falls into the arms of her dancers. NME called the performance "simple, but delivered with so much poise and finesse, you can't help but be impressed."[24] Lorde performed "Sober", with five other songs, as part of a re-imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios where she recorded most of her album,[25] and was part of the set list for her Melodrama World Tour (2017–18) and Solar Power Tour (2022–23).[26][27]

On 7 November 2016, Lorde met with producer Malay in New York City at a session where he underlaid the groove she worked on with Antonoff into the whole song.[2] In this session, she also developed the pause that occurs before the first verse. The horns in the track took inspiration from Hudson Mohawke's production work on TNGHT.[2] She also wanted the track's brass and horns to sound triumphant, testing out a tenor and baritone saxophone as well as the trumpet; Laura Sisk oversaw this during engineering. The sound of a tiger's roar appears before the bridge, which was added two sessions before the song concluded when Antonoff was looking through song samples.[3] According to Antonoff, this was one of his proudest moments when recording Melodrama.[4]

In a podcast interview with Hrishikesh Hirway's Song Exploder, Lorde described her first summer after her breakup with longtime boyfriend James Lowe as "wild and fluorescent"; as a result, she would often go drinking in her native country of New Zealand and had a strong desire to cope with her heartache.[2] Her fear of recording on Westlake Recording Studios, which to her was "too fancy", resulted in her exhibiting writer's block.[2] She found a small production room, which she called "The Rat Nest", to create the song. The groove of the song, came after she played a show at Coachella, which was formed using a bongo drum and Lorde singing the words "night, midnight, lose my mind" which were subsequently sampled into the track.[2]

Its production style was compared to the works of English indie pop band the xx and English downtempo musician James Blake. The song had minor chart placements in Australia and Canada, placing at 61 and 84, respectively. Lorde performed "Sober", with five other songs, as part of a re-imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios where she recorded most of her album. It was also part of the set list of her Melodrama World Tour (2017–18).

Writing for Pitchfork, Marc Hodges called the song "transitional", as if it was in "motion to somewhere else". He noted that while the name of the track was "less novel" for a performer like herself, the "execution was "still tough to deny."[5] Idolator writer Neid stated that while the song was a "bit of a rehash of her previous material," it boasted some of the "most finessed productions" on the album.[18] Despite several comments over the track's conventionality, it was listed at number one on Stereogum's top five songs of the week list for June 16.[19] Peter from the publication commended the singer and Antonoff for being able to "capture the highs and the lows of a night out by crafting a banger that feels both understated and anthemic". DIY also placed "Sober" in their best tracks of the week list, with Will Richards complementing how "wonderfully versatile Lorde has become, and how effortlessly she slips into each guise."[20]

In February 2008, Pink announced that she and her husband Carey Hart had separated,[1] which led the singer to write songs for a new album.[2] It was confirmed that she was working with many music producers such as Butch Walker, Billy Mann, Eg White and Danja.[3] While working on the album, she penned a track called "Sober" with Kara DioGuardi, claiming it was "about the vices that we choose." She added, "I had this idea in my head, 'like how do I feel this good sober?' So I brought that idea to Danja and with this awesome girl Kara DioGuardi and we wrote this song, Sober. And it's a pretty telling song and then me and Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry finished it, production-wise, threw some strings on it and made it a little bit darker and a little bit more rocky."[4] Danja and Marcella Araica contributed to additional lyrics, with Danja, Kanal and Harry serving as the producers of the song. Araica, Harry and Jake Davis recorded the track at Sha Recording (Malibu, California), 3:20 Studios (Los Feliz, Los Angeles) and Henson Recording Studios (Virginia Beach, Virginia). Stevie Blacke arranged and performed all the strings, Jimmy Harry was also responsible for guitars and keyboards, while Tony Kanal provided bass.[5]

"Sober" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in its 2010 edition, but lost it to Beyoncé's "Halo".[25] While listing the "Top 100 Pop Songs of 2008", Bill Lamb of About.com placed the song at number 72, writing that "Pink is likely to make more than a few parents happy with the sentiments of this song celebrating the value of partying sober. She is one of the most consistent artists in the pop mainstream today."[26] "Sober" was also on Lamb's "Top 10 Best Pink Songs" list, being ranked at number 6,[12] while Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio also listed her "Top 10 Songs", placing it at number 5.[27] Jessica Letkemann of Billboard ranked "P!nk's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits", with "Sober" being the 15th, being praised for its "circular guitar riff and a big backbeat."[28] In 2012, Mark Blankenship of New Now Next put the song at number-one on her best tracks, describing that "there are many reasons that 'Sober' is my jam. For one, the lyrics are dense and satisfying. It takes more than a superficial listen to catch the nuance [of the song]. Plus, this story gets told with a thrilling rock score [...]. The 'spinning round' bridge is quiet and lovely, while the chorus is all shouts and emotion. The verses are fully of theatrical pauses and inflections, and the ending just drips with power notes. It’s amazing."[14]

I wrote a song called "Sober", which is actually really dark. I was at a party at my own house, I didn't want to be there, I didn't want anyone else there. And I had this line in my head saying, 'How do I feel this good sober?', it's not just about alcohol, it's about vices, we all have different ones. We try to get away from ourselves, and find our 'true selves' and then we do these things that take us so far from the truth, I guess that 'Sober' is 'How do I feel this good when it's just me, without anything to lean on?'.[15]

Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club stated that 'Sober' is "a solemn song that slinks along at a slower speed, the better to bear out the grainy range of her voice."[21] Spence D. of IGN called it a "syncopated rhythm driven ballad,"[22] while Joan Anderman wrote for Boston Globe that the song "finds the sweet spot between "American Idol" and the Red Hot Chili Peppers."[23] Michael Cragg of musicOMH was more mixed, writing that 'Sober' and 'Please Don't Leave Me' are catchy future singles, but both tread the same I-hate-you-I-love-you path she's walked down a dozen times."[24] In the same vein, Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy called it "not one of her most memorable singles, but [it] should find its way on to the nation's airwaves."[8]

The music video was directed by Jonas Akerlund and filmed in the last days of September in Stockholm, Sweden.[45] It plays on a dream-like space between real and imagined over the course of a night. Pink hosts a party attended by a vamped up version of herself and the two quickly fall into bed, scratching and biting each other.[46]

"Sober" is a power pop song,[8] featuring heavy guitars and booming snare.[10] It is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D♯ minor) and set at a moderately slow tempo of 91 beats per minute, following a chord progression of D♯5–B5–F♯.[11] In the song, Pink's vocals span from the low-note of D♯3 to the high-note of B5. Lyrically, the song speaks about the quiet sense of discomfort in being sober.[12] Lucy Davies of BBC Music went further, writing that the song "discusses the blackouts resulting from drinking to avoid becoming those she sneers at."[10] Chris William, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented that the song finds Pink "questioning her need to be numbed by booze and noise."[13] Mark Blankenship of New Now Next analyzed the song, writing that it is "about a woman who only loves herself when she’s drunk, who wishes she could like herself this much when she’s sober, but who can’t seem to pull herself out of her spiral.[14] She later discussed the song's lyrics in two interviews, stating:

The video starts with views from the city and then a little TV is turned on in Pink's bedroom and Pink appears in white. The song starts, and Pink is shown in the bedroom lying on the bed alone, and a girl is shown walking out of the door of the room. As the first verse starts, Pink is shown sitting on a sofa in a party where her doppelgänger is drunk and flirting with different girls and guys. Pink's doppelgänger is shown in the bathroom, throwing up. Pink enters the bathroom and sits beside her doppelgänger who seemed disturbed and then walks out. Pink is now lying on the bed, her doppelgänger calls her up, but Pink doesn't answer her cell. As the chorus begins, Pink is shown singing on her bed in her bedroom and on the sofa in the party. And then pictures of a white room where Pink is dressed in a white outfit and wearing a white pageboy wig can be shown. The second verse is sung in the same location. As the chorus starts again, Pink is shown walking in the room where the party was held where everybody is blacked out and drunk, including her doppelgänger. As the song reaches its climax, the bridge kicks off and Pink is shown making out with her doppelgänger in bed. The scene was cut or replaced by almost all TV channels. Various scenes from the video are then shown and the video ends with one of the Pinks walking out of the door of the bedroom leaving the other Pink alone.[47]

I have had some vices in my life. When I was younger it was drugs and things and I was given the opportunity to sing … [T]he DJ woke up and said “I’ll give you a guest spot on Friday nights if you never touch drugs again.” It was Thanksgiving of ’95 and I woke up the next morning and never did another drug. I was 15 then, … when I was 21 I was like, “I like alcohol, I never knew about this.” … Then I was getting a divorce and I was drinking a lot. … So everyone was at my house, all these new friends all of sudden, and I looked around and there’s that moment when you’re drinking where you just hate everyone that’s at your house and … I was thinking, "How do I feel this good sober?" 'Cause I'd love — that's the other side of drinking. Why do we drink, you know? To be free of pain, to be free of shyness — it's like that liquid courage. So how do I find this again without this vice? … I'm not going to meet a cute anybody drunk all the time, and I'm on the market. … So I went to the studio the next day, and I thought, "Cool: I want to get drunk and write a song about sobriety. So that's what I did: ”Sober”.[16]

Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain claimed the video was a “shameless ripoff” of the stop-motion animations by filmmakers the Brothers Quay.[6]

The video's protagonist is a small, humanoid being, who lives and sleeps in an abandoned mansion, in a rusty room sparsely decorated with a table, a chair, and a bed with no mattress and a curtain as a blanket. He happens to stumble upon a wooden box, which he opens near the beginning. Its contents are kept hidden for the majority of the video's duration, but it seems whatever it is has had adverse mind altering effects – there are repeated shots of the humanoid levitating in his chair, and his head and arm vibrating wildly. While experiencing these effects, the figure ventures through his living quarters and its many corridors.
Sober has a similar chord progression to the Led Zeppelin song "Kashmir", which has inspired other bands to do mashups of the two songs, something which Tool has approved of.[4]

The song was recorded by Keenan with Tool for the first time in mid-1991 on a demo tape titled 72826.
A video for "Sober" was made in 1993. It debuted in May of that same year and was directed by Fred Stuhr.[5] It was filmed using stop-motion animation, with the characters' models designed by Adam Jones. It was the first of Tool's videos to be made in stop motion, the earlier promo video for "Hush" being live action. Whereas all four band members could be seen at all times during the previous clip, "Sober" shows only brief flashes of them.

"Sober" is a song by American rock band Tool. The song was released as the first single from their debut studio album, Undertow. Tool guitarist Adam Jones has stated in an interview that the song is about a friend of the band whose artistic expression only comes out when he is under the influence. "A lot of people give him shit for that," Jones explains. "If you become addicted and a junkie, well, that's your fault."[3]
"Sober" is one of the earliest songs composed by Maynard James Keenan, with roots dating back to a 1987 live performance (released as Peace Day with his first band, Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty) in which the song was called "Burn About Out". The song contains some lyrics from the first verse of "Sober", with the same basic melody, although the melody is considerably faster and has an instrumental chorus.
The climax provides a barrage of imagery and revelations: a figure attached to a wall behind a translucent screen, a sentry of sorts wielding a mobile, robotic cannon and an organic substance flowing through a pipe found in the house. At the end, the box is empty, leaving the viewer to determine its meaning.
