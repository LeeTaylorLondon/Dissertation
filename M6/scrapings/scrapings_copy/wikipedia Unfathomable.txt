A betrayal-style board game, Unfathomable represents a group of characters aboard the steamer SS Atlantica on a voyage to Boston, Massachusetts in 1913. During the course of the journey, a series of dark occurrences take place, such as a ritualistic murder in the ship's chapel, and the sighting of mysterious creatures trailing the vessel- in actuality Mother Hydra and Father Dagon at the head of a swarm of Deep Ones. The characters are each assigned a secret alliegiance, either human or hybrid, and must work to further the goals of that faction whilst trying to determine the loyalties of the other players.

Unusually, although Unfathomable is set in Fantasy Flight's Arkham Horror Files universe, it features a cast of ten characters which are new to this game. This is to represent the fact that the game takes place several years before the events depicted in the "primary" Arkham Horror Files setting of the late 1920s.

Teeth are an important part of the human (and animal) body. Their main function is to cut off chunks of food for easy consumption. Losing a tooth or two wouldn't be an issue, but losing most, if not all, teeth is a different story. If humans lose their teeth for various reasons, they will be fitted with dentures. Unless they have dentures or have the ability to swallow their food whole, if animals lose their teeth, they might as well wait for death to take them.
After a character has been lost at sea, on a near-deadly airplane flight, or perhaps just on a vacation gone wrong, they'll be so happy to have solid ground beneath their feet or be back home that they'll start to kiss the ground, no matter how filthy it may be. Sometimes for added humor, they'll begin to spit and wipe their mouths in disgust afterwards.
