Set to yes to change the wording for articles containing multiple dynamic lists.

A dynamic list is any list that may never be fully complete (since it will only include notable examples from a given category), or may require constant updates to remain current.
Place this notification template immediately before the applicable incomplete list (i.e. in a section, not at the top of the article). This template will automatically add the article to Category:Dynamic lists.
System dynamics, the study of the behavior of complex systems
Dynamic program analysis, a set of methods for analyzing computer software
Molecular dynamics, the study of motion on the molecular level
Neural oscillation in neurodynamics, a rhythmic pattern in the brain
Dynamical system, a concept describing a point's time dependencyTopological dynamics, the study of dynamical systems from the viewpoint of general topology
