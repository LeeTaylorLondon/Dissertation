In a StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm Easter egg, two in-game characters are named after the casters.[22]
"My job basically entails me dissecting the game and making something that is consumable for a regular viewer, so we talk about the strategies but we try to do that without too much gamer terminology and we also try to connect with our viewers. Most of our viewers are between the ages of 15 and 32 so we try to incorporate a lot of humour with nerd culture and talk about other games - but we are basically entertainers."
Nicolas Plott (born August 11, 1984), known by his alias Tasteless, is an American esports commentator. He moved to Seoul, Korea in 2007 to give commentary to e-sports competitions.[2] He has provided commentary for multiple Starcraft and Starcraft 2 tournaments. Together with Dan "Artosis" Stemkoski, he currently provides commentary for Global StarCraft II League and AfreecaTV StarLeague games.

In his free time, Tasteless regularly streams Starcraft gameplay on his Twitch Channel in which he typically plays as Protoss.[25] As of December 2022 he has over 53,000 followers on Twitch.
Plott and Stemkoski prepare separately, with Stemkoski constantly watching StarCraft matches and Plott studying commentary from non-traditional sports and major StarCraft news.[5] Together, they incorporate team histories and their respective strategies into their commentary.[5] Plott has said that he considers Tastosis' nuanced readings of player tactics and their eventualities as a "gateway" for bringing unfamiliar crowds into StarCraft.[5] Due to the age range of their audience being 15–32, they try to incorporate humor as well.[3]

As StarCraft II's launch neared, Plott and another American commentator living in Seoul, Dan "Artosis" Stemkoski, had individually amassed followings, and had the interest of commercial broadcast networks.[5] The two began casting together and became known by a portmanteau of their nicknames, Tasteless and Artosis, as Tastosis.[5] Before this partnership, the two knew each other through their former competitive gaming careers, but became friends in Korea.[5] Polygon attributed their success to their "magic" dynamic from complementary personalities, with Plott bold and sociable, and Stemkoski encyclopedic and analytic.[5]

In Plott's last semester of college, Korean broadcasting company GOM TV invited him to provide English commentary for competitive Starcraft: Broodwar series as part of a strategy to extend their reach.[5][7] He dropped out of college and arrived in Seoul within a week.[5] In Korea, Plott slept on friends' couches and worked as a caster where he could.[5] This did not guarantee a career or easy move, but offered Plott an opportunity to make a career of his StarCraft commentary and become the first Western StarCraft commentator, or caster, in South Korea in 2007.[8] Plott provided commentary for the Star Invitational, with around 75,000 viewers for the finals, and 3 seasons of the Averatec-Intel Classic.[7] Plot was joined by Susie 'lilsusie' Kim as co-caster for one season of the Avertec-Intel Classic. Plott first met Kim at BlizzCon in 2005.[9]

With the advent of high-speed Internet, the brothers played StarCraft competitively on Korean servers.[5] They entered and won tournaments while in high school.[5] Plott became uninterested in school when it did not let him incorporate StarCraft into his studies.[5] He played the game through high school and college.[5].mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:.5em 1.4em .8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:.5em 0 .8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5em auto .8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright span{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox>blockquote{margin:0;padding:0;border-left:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{background-color:#F9F9F9;text-align:center;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote>:first-child{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote:last-child>:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:" “ ";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:" ” ";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quote-title,.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quotebox-quote{display:block}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 .8em!important;float:none!important}}
Upon losing to his brother early in the World Cyber Games 2005 finals, Plott watched the rest of the games as a spectator.[5] He became frustrated by the tournament commentator's inexperienced handling of in-game nuances and requested to co-host the commentary, which was a success.[5] He received offers to commentate without pay in Europe, Japan, and Singapore.[5]

Being a notable foreign StarCraft player, Nick managed to qualify for the 2005 USA WCG Finals, beating out future progamer Tyler "NonY" Watson in one of the qualifiers. He caught a bad break and had to play his brother, and practice partner, Sean "Day[9]" Plott in the first round. He lost. Since the bracket was single-elimination, Tasteless found himself with nothing to do, but noticed that the official caster lacked experience with the details of StarCraft. Nick approached the staff and asked if he could help with the casting. After overcoming the first wave of hesitation from the staff, he was allowed to cast the games. The staff of WCG USA thought he did such a good job that they offered him to cast from the WCG Grand Finals, which he accepted.

Nicolas "Tasteless" Plott is an American Protoss player and widely noted commentator.
He casted all three seasons of GOM TV Classic, the second season with Susan "lilsusie" Kim and the third season with Daniel "SuperDanielMan" Lee, before GOM TV clashed with KeSPA and a few teams, killing the league. After the end of the GOM TV Classic, Tasteless decided to stay in South Korea and continue his path as a professional StarCraft caster. Thanks to his friendship with Dan "Artosis" Stemkoski, and his connection within the proscene, they started commentating games together--most notably the WCG 2009 in China, where the StarCraft grand finals drew a crowd previously only seen in South Korea.
Nick's success continued during the grand finals and after the tournament he was approached by representatives from GOM TV, who was just starting their own Starleague in South Korea, offering him a job as a caster in South Korea. Nick decided to go, despite only having one term left on his college education.
He and Artosis are now the official English-speaking casters for the AfreecaTV Global StarCraft II League.
In the end of 2009 and early 2010 the duo once again came together, neatly named "The Casting Archon", for the 2009 Pokerstrategy.com TSL.
