Production licences for the Rough field were given in 1964, and gas was first brought ashore to Easington gas processing terminal in 1975. In 1980 British Gas Corporation (which became British Gas plc in 1986 following privatisation) purchased the Rough field with one-third of reserves depleted, with the intention of converting the field into a gas storage facility to manage seasonal trends in the supply and demand of gas in the UK. In 1983 British Gas Corporation made the final decision to convert Rough into a natural gas storage facility. It came into operation in 1985 as the largest gas storage facility built in the UK continental shelf, capable of storing 100 billion cubic feet of gas, nearly double Great Britain's 2021 capacity.[5][6][7]
The Rough processing terminal forms a part of the larger Easington Gas Terminal, which can inject upwards of 125 million cubic metres per day (approximately 40% of the daily UK supply).
The offshore installations and their details and functions were as follows.[19]

At the time of the announcement of the rundown of the facility in June 2017, Rough was the only depleted UK offshore gas field reservoir used for gas storage and retrieval.[17] Several projects have been proposed to use other depleted offshore fields but none has proved to be economically viable; two examples are the Baird and Deborah gas storage projects.[18]

The break-up of British Gas plc in 1997 into BG Group and Centrica meant that BG Storage was created as a ring-fenced subsidiary of BG Group, for competition reasons. In 2001, BG Group sold BG Storage, and thus the Rough facility, to Dynegy.[8] In 2002, Centrica bought the plant from Dynegy for £304 million during Dynegy's period of near-bankruptcy. The purchase of Rough led to the Competition Commission requesting certain undertakings being put in place because of Centrica's control of the Morecambe Bay gas fields which at the time were providing 10–15% of the UK's gas supply. In 2003 Centrica provided DECC with a set of undertakings and Centrica Storage Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica plc) was formed. Centrica Storage Ltd still operates the Rough facility in accordance with the undertakings.

The facility had made a profit for its owners by exploiting the difference in gas price between summer and winter. Gas was injected for storage when its future price on the commodities futures market rose above its current market price. That gas would be sold with a future delivery date, creating an instant profit, and then held in the facility until the date contracted with the purchaser on which it was required to be delivered.[9]

First opened in 1985, it was closed by Centrica Storage Ltd in 2017 because of the need for costly maintenance, the UK government declining to subsidise repairs.[1] Centrica gained approval from safety inspectors for the facility to be brought back into service in August 2022,[2] and it was partly reopened on 28 October 2022.[3][4]

When fully open, Rough had a storage capacity of 3.31 billion cubic metres, approximately 70 per cent of the UK's gas storage capacity (approximately nine days' supply). Rough could supply 10 per cent of the UK's peak gas demand and thus was an important part of the UK's gas infrastructure. Operational problems led to a partial shutdown in 2016, requiring increased imports during that winter.[15][6][16]
However this business model became harder to operate as the global market in liquefied natural gas developed. This was one of the factors leading to Rough's closure in 2017.[9]
Additionally, there is an onshore gas-processing terminal at Easington, which compresses gas and transfers it offshore to the Bravo complex through a 36-inch (91 cm) pipeline. The Bravo platforms have two Rolls-Royce Avon gas turbine engines that drive compressors forcing the gas down to the reservoir, around 300 metres (980 ft) below the sea bed.[14] As gas stored in the reservoir becomes slightly contaminated with water and hydrocarbons, the offshore platforms also have facilities for cleaning and drying the gas after extraction. The water is discharged, while the hydrocarbons are re-mixed with the gas and carried to shore in the pipeline.[14]

In fact any enhancement of Brownian motion as a geometric rough path will give rise a calculus that satisfies this classical product rule. Itô calculus does not come directly from enhancing Brownian motion as a geometric rough path, but rather as a branched rough path.

If Y{\displaystyle \mathbf {Y} } is a γ{\displaystyle \gamma }-controlled path where γ>p−1{\displaystyle \gamma >p-1}, then

It is also possible to extend the core results in rough path theory to infinite dimensions, providing that the norm on the tensor algebra satisfies certain admissibility condition.[24]
Suppose that X(n){\displaystyle \mathbf {X} (n)} converges in the p{\displaystyle p}-variation metric to a p{\displaystyle p}-geometric rough path X{\displaystyle \mathbf {X} } as n→∞{\displaystyle n\to \infty }. Let (Vji)j=1,…,di=1,…,n{\displaystyle (V_{j}^{i})_{j=1,\ldots ,d}^{i=1,\ldots ,n}} be functions that have at least ⌊p⌋{\displaystyle \lfloor p\rfloor } bounded derivatives and the ⌊p⌋{\displaystyle \lfloor p\rfloor }-th derivatives are α{\displaystyle \alpha }-Hölder continuous for some α>p−⌊p⌋{\displaystyle \alpha >p-\lfloor p\rfloor }. Let Y(n){\displaystyle Y(n)} be the solution to the differential equation

where the supremum is taken over all finite partitions {0=t0<t1<⋯<tn=1}{\displaystyle \{0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots <t_{n}=1\}} of [0,1]{\displaystyle [0,1]}.
In fact, rough path theory can go far beyond the scope of Itô and Stratonovich calculus and allows to make sense of differential equations driven by non-semimartingale paths, such as Gaussian processes and Markov processes.[11]
The Universal Limit Theorem once again reduces this problem to whether the Brownian rough path Bs,t{\displaystyle \mathbf {B_{s,t}} } exists and satisfies the multiplicative property that for all s≤u≤t{\displaystyle s\leq u\leq t},

Rough path theory is focused on capturing and making precise the interactions between highly oscillatory and non-linear systems. It builds upon the harmonic analysis of L.C. Young, the geometric algebra of K.T. Chen, the Lipschitz function theory of H. Whitney and core ideas of stochastic analysis. The concepts and the uniform estimates have widespread application in pure and applied Mathematics and beyond. It provides a toolbox to recover with relative ease many classical results in stochastic analysis (Wong-Zakai, Stroock-Varadhan support theorem, construction of stochastic flows, etc) without using specific probabilistic properties such as the martingale property or predictability. The theory also extends Itô's theory of SDEs far beyond the semimartingale setting. At the heart of the mathematics is the challenge of describing a smooth but potentially highly oscillatory and multidimensional path xt{\displaystyle x_{t}} effectively so as to accurately predict its effect on a nonlinear dynamical system dyt=f(yt)dxt,y0=a{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} y_{t}=f(y_{t})\,\mathrm {d} x_{t},y_{0}=a}. The Signature is a homomorphism from the monoid of paths (under concatenation) into the grouplike elements of the free tensor algebra. It provides a graduated summary of the path x{\displaystyle x}. This noncommutative transform is faithful for paths up to appropriate null modifications. These graduated summaries or features of a path are at the heart of the definition of a rough path; locally they remove the need to look at the fine structure of the path. Taylor's theorem explains how any smooth function can, locally, be expressed as a linear combination of certain special functions (monomials based at that point). Coordinate iterated integrals (terms of the signature) form a more subtle algebra of features that can describe a stream or path in an analogous way; they allow a definition of rough path and form a natural linear "basis" for continuous functions on paths.

A central result in rough path theory is Lyons' Universal Limit theorem.[1] One (weak) version of the result is the following: Let X(n){\displaystyle X(n)} be a sequence of paths with finite total variation and let
A geometric rough path X{\displaystyle \mathbf {X} } satisfies S(X)0,1=(1,0,…){\displaystyle S(\mathbf {X} )_{0,1}=(1,0,\ldots )} if and only if X{\displaystyle \mathbf {X} } is tree-like.[20][21]
A p{\displaystyle p}-geometric rough path is tree-like if there exists a continuous function h:[0,1]→[0,∞){\displaystyle h:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,\infty )} such that h(0)=h(1)=0{\displaystyle h(0)=h(1)=0} and for all j=1,…,⌊p⌋{\displaystyle j=1,\ldots ,\lfloor p\rfloor } and all 0≤s≤t≤1{\displaystyle 0\leq s\leq t\leq 1},
In fact, rough path theory gives the existence and uniqueness of ϕs,t(x){\displaystyle \phi _{s,t}(x)} not only outside a null set independent of s{\displaystyle s},t{\displaystyle t} and x{\displaystyle x} but also of the drift b{\displaystyle b} and the volatility σ{\displaystyle \sigma }.

The Universal Limit Theorem guarantees that the Itô map sending the control path (t,εBt){\displaystyle (t,{\sqrt {\varepsilon }}B_{t})} to the solution Xε{\displaystyle X^{\varepsilon }} is a continuous map from the p{\displaystyle p}-variation topology to the p{\displaystyle p}-variation topology (and hence the uniform topology). Therefore, the Contraction principle in large deviations theory reduces Freidlin–Wentzell's problem to demonstrating the large deviation principle for (t,εBt){\displaystyle (t,{\sqrt {\varepsilon }}B_{t})} in the p{\displaystyle p}-variation topology.[10]

Rough paths are paths taking values in the truncated free tensor algebra (more precisely: in the free nilpotent group embedded in the free tensor algebra), which this section now briefly recalls. The tensor powers of Rd{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}, denoted (Rd)⊗n{\displaystyle {\big (}\mathbb {R} ^{d}{\big )}^{\otimes n}}, are equipped with the projective norm ‖⋅‖{\displaystyle \Vert \cdot \Vert } (see Topological tensor product, note that rough path theory in fact works for a more general class of norms). Let T(n)(Rd){\displaystyle T^{(n)}(\mathbb {R} ^{d})} be the truncated tensor algebra

then Y(n){\displaystyle Y(n)} converges to Y{\displaystyle Y} in the p{\displaystyle p}-variation metric. This continuity property and the deterministic nature of solutions makes it possible to simplify and strengthen many results in Stochastic Analysis, such as the Freidlin-Wentzell's Large Deviation theory[10] as well as results about stochastic flows.
converges almost surely in the p{\displaystyle p}-variation metric to a p{\displaystyle p}-geometric rough path for 1H14{\displaystyle H>{\frac {1}{4}}}. When 0<H≤14{\displaystyle 0<H\leq {\frac {1}{4}}}, it turns out that the above limit along dyadic approximations does not converge in p{\displaystyle p}-variation. However, one can of course still make sense of differential equations provided one exhibits a rough path lift, existence of such a (non-unique) lift is a consequence of the Lyons–Victoir extension theorem.

There are, in particular, many results on the solution to differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion that have been proved using a combination of Malliavin calculus and rough path theory. In fact, it has been proved recently that the solution to controlled differential equation driven by a class of Gaussian processes, which includes fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H>14{\displaystyle H>{\frac {1}{4}}}, has a smooth density under the Hörmander's condition on the vector fields.[17][18]

Concisely, the theorem can be interpreted as saying that the solution map (aka the Itô-Lyons map) Φ:GΩp(Rd)→GΩp(Re){\displaystyle \Phi :G\Omega _{p}(\mathbb {R} ^{d})\to G\Omega _{p}(\mathbb {R} ^{e})} of the RDE (⋆){\displaystyle (\star )} is continuous (and in fact locally lipschitz) in the p{\displaystyle p}-variation topology. Hence rough paths theory demonstrates that by viewing driving signals as rough paths, one has a robust solution theory for classical stochastic differential equations and beyond.

where the control, the continuous path Xt{\displaystyle X_{t}} taking values in a Banach space, need not be differentiable nor of bounded variation.

In stochastic analysis, a rough path is a generalization of the notion of smooth path allowing to construct a robust solution theory for controlled differential equations driven by classically irregular signals, for example a Wiener process.

Note that every stochastic process (even if it is a deterministic path) can have more than one (in fact, uncountably many) possible enhancements.[14] Different enhancements will give rise to different solutions to the controlled differential equations. In particular, it is possible to enhance Brownian motion to a geometric rough path in a way other than the Brownian rough path.[15] This implies that the Stratonovich calculus is not the only theory of stochastic calculus that satisfies the classical product rule
Given the signature of a path, it is possible to reconstruct the unique path that has no tree-like pieces.[22][23]
More precisely, let L(V,W){\displaystyle L(V,W)} denote the space of bounded linear maps from a Banach space V{\displaystyle V} to another Banach space W{\displaystyle W}.
Martin Hairer used rough paths to construct a robust solution theory for the KPZ equation.[8] He then proposed a generalization known as the theory of regularity structures[9] for which he was awarded a Fields medal in 2014.
