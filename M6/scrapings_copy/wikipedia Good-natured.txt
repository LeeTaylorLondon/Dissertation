Goodnature released the first beta self-resetting trap for rats and stoats during New Zealand Conservation Week in September 2009.[5] The initial technology could self-reset 12 times using compressed CO2. Field testingled to the development of a trap for brushtail possums,[2] and another for rats and stoats. The company also built a lure development facility to test animal attractants as lures.[6]

Goodnature traps are also used in conservation projects throughout Hawaii including in Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Oahu,[24] in the Waianae and Ko'olau mountain ranges of Oahu, and on the island of Lanai.[25]
Goodnature produces and sells two pest control devices; one for brushtail possums, and another trap for rats and stoats; it also produces toxin-free lures to target these pests.[6][10]
Goodnature is a New Zealand manufacturer of lethal traps for animals such as stoats, rats, mice and possums. It was founded by Robbie van Dam and Craig Bond in 2005, and sells automatic self-resetting pest control traps and accessories.[1]
Goodnature was founded by friends Robbie van Dam and Craig Bond who met while studying industrial design at Victoria University. Van Dam had a job at the Department of Conservation (DOC) in the Biodiversity Unit building gadgets for pest control when he noticed the methods for killing pest species such as rats, stoats and possums were either inefficient or inhumane.[2][3] DOC funded the development of some of their early concepts to create the traps manufactured by Goodnature today.[4]
"Goodnature & DOC win top design prize at Best Awards"
The traps were put into long-term, large scale evaluation by DOC from 2010–2016.[7][8] Goodnature’s traps are endorsed by the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) for their efficiency in killing pests,[1] and by DOC’s Science and Technical team which recommends their use for conservation projects to protect New Zealand native plant and bird species.[9]

The company has also developed targeted devices for introduced mongoose in Hawaii, the introduced American mink in Finland and Sweden, and the introduced grey squirrel in the United Kingdom.[26][27][28][29]The company's traps are now used in more than 25 countries including: the United States, Canada, England, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Scotland, Ireland, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Australia.[30][31]

The self-resetting traps are powered by compressed gas and use a target-specific lure to attract animals.The traps work by striking the skull of the animal with a steel-cored, glass reinforced, polymer piston (described as a captive bolt), killing it almost instantly. This piston is driven bycompressed CO2 when the animal triggers the trap. Once the animal has been struck, the piston returns, dropping the animal to the ground and resetting the trap.[1] The traps have achieved the Class A standard for humaneness as set out in the MPI's National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee's guidelines.[8] This is the only possum trap ever to have met this standard.[11] The A24 also meets the United Kingdom’s Spring Traps Approval Order.[12]
DOC has used Goodnature traps on Native Island, Southland,[16] at Harts Hill in Fiordland National Park,[17] at Boundary Stream, Hawkes Bay, Te Urewera Mainland Island,[16] and at Abel Tasman National Park[18] In June 2017, 1200 stoat traps were installed on 11,400 hectares of the Haast Kiwi Sanctuary to protect tokoeka kiwi, as part of the department's Battle For Our Birds programme.[19] In the same programme, DOC also increased the number of stoat traps in Arthur's Pass National Park and Lake Sumner Forest Park in an effort to save one of New Zealand’s rarest parakeets (orange-fronted parakeet) from extinction.[20] In January 2017,the kiwi sanctuary at Rimutaka Forest Park was doubled in size to 7000 hectares to aid the regeneration of New Zealand’s North Island brown kiwi. A total of 1200 Goodnature traps were laid down to reduce the number of stoats at the park which prey on kiwi.[21]
