Conformist comes from the Old French word conformer, which means "to agree to, make or be similar, be agreeable." People sometimes use the term conformist in a negative way, as an insult implying that someone doesn't have the brains or the guts to question the status quo. Conformist can also be used as an adjective to describe something that follows convention and established customs. A conformist school board, for example, would follow the usual time-tested curriculum.

Authoritarian institutions (such as military organizations and organized religions) tend to glorify and reinforce conformism within their ranks, as do many large corporations. Their influence has both subconscious and overt aspects. Typically, those calling for conformism and for obedience to authority couch their demands in conservative terms to give the impression that they aim at the preservation of the status quo - which(critics often say) can mask power-grabs and the exercise of self-interest.
