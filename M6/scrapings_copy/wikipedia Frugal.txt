Spotlighted in a 2010 article in The Economist,[14] the roots of this concept may lie in the appropriate technology movement of the 1950s,[12] although profits may have been first wrung from underserved consumers in the 1980s when multinational companies like Unilever began selling single-use-sized toiletries in developing countries.[2] Frugal innovation today is not solely the domain of large, multinational corporations: small, local firms have themselves chalked up a number of homegrown solutions.[15] While General Electric may win plaudits for its US$800 EKG machines, cheap cell phones made by local, no-name companies,[11][15] and prosthetic legs fashioned from irrigation piping,[16] are also examples of frugal innovation.

Several US universities have programs that develop frugal solutions. Such efforts include the Frugal Innovation Lab at Santa Clara University and a two quarter project course at Stanford University, the Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability program.[8]
Frugal innovation is not limited to durable goods such as the GE US$800 EKG machine, Reliance Jio's JioPhone or the US$100 One Laptop Per Child but also includes services such as 1-cent-per-minute phone calls, mobile banking, off-grid electricity, and microfinance.[3]

Frugal innovation or frugal engineering is the process of reducing the complexity and cost of a good and its production. Usually this refers to removing nonessential features from a durable good, such as a car or telephone, in order to sell it in developing countries. Designing products for such countries may also call for an increase in durability[1] and, when selling the products, reliance on unconventional distribution channels.[2] When trying to sell to so-called "overlooked consumers", firms hope volume will offset razor-thin profit margins.[2] Globalization[3] and rising incomes in developing countries may also drive frugal innovation.[4] Such services and products need not be of inferior quality but must be provided cheaply.[5] While frugal innovation has been associated with good-enough performance, in some sectors such as in healthcare, frugal innovation must offer maximum performance without compromising on quality.[6]
