Consuming suspicious stew is the only way to obtain the Saturation and Blindness effects in vanilla Minecraft without the use of commands.
↑ The stew grants one of the following effects: 5–7 seconds of Blindness, 7–10 seconds of Jump Boost, 7-10 seconds of Night Vision, 10–20 seconds of Poison, 0.35-0.5 seconds of Saturation, or 6–8 seconds of Weakness.

After being given a flower, a brown mooshroom can be "milked" for suspicious stew by using a bowl on it. The flower type determines the stew's effect using the same rule as a crafted stew. Milking a red mooshroom after feeding it a flower does not yield a suspicious stew specific to that flower.
↑ Can be 1.0, 0.95, or 1.05 for each sound
One of these for each effect. EffectId: The numeric ID of the effect. EffectDuration: The duration of the effect in ticks. Values 0 or lower are treated as 1. Optional, and defaults to 160 ticks (8 seconds).
In Bedrock Edition, master-level farmer villagers have a 1⁄3 chance to sell suspicious stew for one emerald, and an expert-level farmer villager offers to sell suspicious stew for one emerald as well.

In Bedrock Edition, suspicious stew is the only food item in the game that cannot be obtained from the Creative inventory. However, it can be crafted and found in shipwreck chests. Suspicious stew can be given with commands like /give, but in Java Edition, unless NBT data like that listed in the data values section is included, consuming it has no effect and still restores the same hunger points as a normal suspicious stew. In Bedrock Edition, giving the player a suspicious stew through commands causes the stew to choose an allowable status effect at random.
Suspicious stew was introduced because developers wanted a way of communicating that lilies of the valley are poisonous.[2]

The recipe book does not assist with crafting suspicious stew, so the player must know the recipe. Normally a player clicks the mushroom stew recipe and adds one flower to it, because a suspicious stew is basically a mushroom stew with an added flower.
The Saturation effect effectively makes those two stews a superfood: In those 6 or 7 ticks it can restore up to 6(7) hunger and 12(14) saturation points on top of their food value, for a total of at least 12 ( × 6) hunger, and effectively maximizing saturation. This is the largest amount of hunger and saturation the player can get from a single food item. Regeneration can restore up to 3 health, and Poison or Wither can inflict up to 4 damage.

In Java Edition, expert-level farmer villagers can offer either 1 or 2 suspicious stew trades, each stew for one emerald.
Crafting a suspicious stew is known as shapeless recipe because the stew can be crafted by placing its ingredients in any order on the crafting grid unlike most other recipes. Tall flowers do not produce suspicious stew.
Suspicious stew is a food item that can give the player a status effect that depends on the flower used to craft it.
The bowl is emptied and returned to the player after the suspicious stew has been eaten, and can be re-used to craft more stews. Unlike most foods, suspicious stew can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is full.
In Bedrock Edition, suspicious stew uses the following data values:
To eat suspicious stew, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 6 () hunger and 7.2 hunger saturation and gives a few seconds of a status effect that varies depending on which flower was used to craft it. The effect is not displayed in the tooltip, texture, etc., meaning that the player cannot know in advance what the effect is without knowing which flower was used.
Effects: The status effects this suspicious stew has. One of these for each effect. EffectId: The numeric ID of the effect. EffectDuration: The duration of the effect in ticks. Values 0 or lower are treated as 1. Optional, and defaults to 160 ticks (8 seconds).
The trading interface does not indicate the type of suspicious stew being sold, but each trade entry consistently yields the same type of stew, so the player can remember or make a note of the types offered by a given villager, such as "this villager's first stew gives blindness, and their second entry gives saturation".
