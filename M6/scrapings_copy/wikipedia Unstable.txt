Unstable is the second studio album by the American rock band Adema, and is the final album to feature its full original lineup with lead vocalist Mark Chavez and guitarist Mike Ransom departing from the band after its release and then again after their reunion, although they returned to the band in March 2017 (only for Mark to leave once again in 2019). The album was released on August 19, 2003 by Arista Records. It features the self-titled single "Unstable" and has sold about 400,000 copies worldwide. Many songs relied more on instrumentation and harmony instead of distortion in comparison to their previous album. It debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200 before quickly falling off the chart.

The music video depicts the band playing in a desert like location, with sandy gusts of wind billowing around them. The video occasionally cuts away to Mark Chavez, the lead vocalist, as he runs through a windy location, storm clouds everywhere, with a female floating around him. In the end, Chavez is lying on a roof protected from the wind. He reaches out to try and catch the female from drifting away. In the end of the video, the house that Mark was lying on explodes, and quick-cuts of Mark Chavez and the woman holding hands are shown.
"Unstable" is the first single released from the Adema album, Unstable. It is featured in Madden NFL 2004
