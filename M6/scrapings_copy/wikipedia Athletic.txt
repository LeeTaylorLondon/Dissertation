In September 2021, The Athletic released a report detailing the gross sexual misconduct of association football coach Paul Riley in the NWSL. The report detailed Riley's sexual abuse of several players, namely Sinead Farrelly and Meleana Shim, as well as an unnamed additional player, while coaching at Portland Thorns FC. The report also revealed that the allegations, first reported to the club in 2016, were partially responsible for the decision not to renew his contract in Portland. Riley, however, immediately assumed a new coaching position within the NWSL. The NWSL, and Riley's current team, responded with no comment. Paul Riley denied all allegations.[55] Riley was fired shortly afterward, and the relevant soccer bodies (NWSL, FIFA and the United States Soccer Federation) launched investigations.

The Athletic was founded by Alex Mather and Adam Hansmann, former coworkers at subscription-based fitness company Strava, with the mission of producing "smarter coverage for die-hard fans."[4] The company was built as an alternative to the struggling ad-supported models.[5] The Athletic relies on subscription revenue, not advertising revenue, to support the business.[6] Mather and Hansmann believed sports fans would be willing to pay for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.[7] At the time, a few newspapers were trying out paywalls, but the common industry view was that information on the internet needed to be free.[8]

Investors, media executives, and reporters who don’t work for the Athletic all express skepticism about the business. But almost no one will share these sentiments publicly. Who wants to be seen badmouthing one of the only places still hiring journalists? Bringing on writers for top dollar and freeing them from chasing clicks is admirable, the doubters say, but it’s no way to make money.

The Athletic News and Cyclists' Journal was a Manchester-based newspaper founded by Edward Hulton in 1875. It was published weekly, covering weekend sports fixtures other than horse racing, which was already covered by the Sporting Chronicle founded by Hulton in 1871.[1] It was an advocate of professional football and many of its staff were actively involved in the sport.[1][2]
In 1931 it merged with the Sporting Chronicle's Monday edition.[1] The original name was preserved until the 1940s in the titles of the Athletic News Football Annual first issued in 1887 and the Athletic News Cricket Annual first issued in 1888; both these annuals were eventually taken over by the Sunday Chronicle, founded by Hulton in 1885.
