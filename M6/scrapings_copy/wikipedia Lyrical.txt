Architecture: The Nasir ol-Molk Mosque may be seen as an example, as well as the Taj Mahal, or the Sistine Chapel. Modern examples would be some of the later works of Le Corbusier[4] and Zaha Hadid.[6]
Although it is impossible to define beauty, emotion, or imagination in a definitive manner, it is possible to draw upon examples of works that may share those characteristics in both subtle and dramatic ways.The following are some classic examples of lyricism:
Film: Lost, Lost, Lost (1976) has been described as an example of the mid-20th century lyricism movement in film, as well as The Art of Vision (1965) and Fireworks (1947).[7]

Lyricism is when art is expressed in a beautiful or imaginative way, or when it has an expressive quality.[2] Although the term "lyricism" is often used in conjunction with art composed of sound alone, it can also apply to all forms of art, including paintings, performance,[3] poetry, architecture,[4] or film.[5]
Lyricism is a quality that expresses deep feelings or emotions in an inspired work of art.[1]

In Baroque music, melodies and their lyrics were prose. Rather than paired lines they consist of rhetorical sentences or paragraphs consisting of an opening gesture, an amplification (often featuring sequence), and a close (featuring a cadence); in German Vordersatz-Fortspinnung-Epilog.[9] For example:

The word lyric derives via Latin lyricus from the Greek λυρικός (lurikós),[1] the adjectival form of lyre.[2] It first appeared in English in the mid-16th century in reference to the Earl of Surrey's translations of Petrarch and to his own sonnets.[3] Greek lyric poetry had been defined by the manner in which it was sung accompanied by the lyre or cithara,[4] as opposed to the chanted formal epics or the more passionate elegies accompanied by the flute. The personal nature of many of the verses of the Nine Lyric Poets led to the present sense of "lyric poetry" but the original Greek sense of "lyric poetry"—"poetry accompanied by the lyre" i.e. "words set to music"—eventually led to its use as "lyrics", first attested in Stainer and Barrett's 1876 Dictionary of Musical Terms.[5] Stainer and Barrett used the word as a singular substantive: "Lyric, poetry or blank verse intended to be set to music and sung". By the 1930s, the present use of the plurale tantum "lyrics" had begun; it has been standard since the 1950s for many writers.[1] The singular form "lyric" is still used to mean the complete words to a song by authorities such as Alec Wilder,[6] Robert Gottlieb,[7] and Stephen Sondheim.[8] However, the singular form is also commonly used to refer to a specific line (or phrase) within a song's lyrics.

However, the verse may pre-date its tune (in the way that "Rule Britannia" was set to music, and "And did those feet in ancient time" has become the hymn "Jerusalem"), or the tune may be lost over time but the words survive, matched by a number of different tunes (this is particularly common with hymns and ballads).
Analogously, verse drama might normally be judged (at its best) as poetry, but not consisting of poems (see dramatic verse).

Lyrics can be studied from an academic perspective. For example, some lyrics can be considered a form of social commentary. Lyrics often contain political, social, and economic themes—as well as aesthetic elements—and so can communicate culturally significant messages. These messages can be explicit, or implied through metaphor or symbolism. Lyrics can also be analyzed with respect to the sense of unity (or lack of unity) it has with its supporting music. Analysis based on tonality and contrast are particular examples. Former Oxford Professor of Poetry Christopher Ricks famously published Dylan's Visions of Sin, an in-depth and characteristically Ricksian analysis of the lyrics of Bob Dylan; Ricks gives the caveat that to have studied the poetry of the lyrics in tandem with the music would have made for a much more complicated critical feat.
In the lyrics of popular music a "shifter"[10] is a word, often a pronoun, "where reference varies according to who is speaking, when and where",[11] such as "I", "you", "my", "our". For example, who is the "my" of "My Generation"?

Lyrics are words that make up a song, usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a "libretto" and their writer, as a "librettist". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics (often with a variation of rhyming words) that are meant to be spoken rhythmically rather than sung.

Beginning in late 2014, Google changed its search results pages to include song lyrics. When users search for a name of a song, Google can now display the lyrics directly in the search results page.[17] When users search for a specific song's lyrics, most results show the lyrics directly through a Google search by using Google Play.[18]

The differences between poem and song may become less meaningful where verse is set to music, to the point that any distinction becomes untenable. This is perhaps recognised in the way popular songs have lyrics.

The lyrical subject may be an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; the author as a subject; the author's persona[2] or some other character appearing and participating within the story of a poem (an example would be the lyrical speaker of The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe - a lonely man who misses his lost love Leonor, not Edgar Allan Poe), whether fictitious or factual. Therefore, the lyrical subject is the character to which the author intends to give life in his text. Although sometimes the author can refer to himself, he will always do so in the form of a speaker and not directly. The subject functions as a revealing agent of experiences and the emotions of the poem.[2]

The lyrical subject, lyrical speaker or lyrical I is the voice or person in charge of narrating the words of a poem or other lyrical work.[1] The lyrical subject is a conventional literary figure, historically associated with the author, although it is not necessarily the author who speaks for themselves in the subject.[1]
