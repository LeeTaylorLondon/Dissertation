(Most of the rest of the scene is in iambic tetrameters catalectic, accompanied by a piper.) Getas comes out and tells Simiche she may go inside since he is going to sit with Knemon. Then he calls out the cook Sikon and asks him he would like to come to get his own back on Knemon for his earlier rudeness. He suggests that they can tease him and infuriate him by asking to borrow things. Sicon goes into the house and brings out Knemon, who is asleep. He lays him down. Then Getas bangs on the door and shouts to imaginary slave boys that he wishes to borrow things. Next Sikon comes and does the same thing. In poetic language he describes the delightful party which Knemon is missing. Now they help Knemon to his feet and call two more slaves to carry him into the temple. Getas asks the audience to applaud.

Gorgias returns from the fields with Daos. He scolds Daos and tells him that he should have spoken to the stranger sooner. Sostratos, who has been back home, enters saying that Getas was not available, because Sostratos's mother had sent him to hire a cook so that she could make a sacrifice; so Sostratos must try to speak to the girl's father himself. Gorgias stops Sostratos and asks if he may give him some advice: he warns him to stay away and not think he can get away with bad behaviour just because of his wealth. Sostratos protests that he is in love with the girl and has come to see her father because he wants to marry her. Gorgias tells him that he's wasting his time, since her father is very misanthropic and won't let her marry anyone except a poor farmer like himself. Daos advises him that if he takes off his smart cloak and works in the fields the girl's father might agree to talk to him. He lends Sostratos his two-pronged hoe and goes off to do some other work. Sostratos and Gorgias go off to the fields.
Suddenly Sostratos's father Kallipides arrives. Sostratos tells him that the sacrifice is over, but that they have saved him some food. Kallipides goes inside the temple to eat. He is followed by Sostratos, who wants to ask for permission to marry Knemon's daughter. Gorgias goes inside too.
Menander writes his slave characters as intelligent, independent individuals who act on their own wants and goals, as well as considering the fortunes of their masters. These characters impact the story lines of the other characters while not directly changing them. The play as a whole demonstrates and examines the social class system of the time and provides multiple perspectives through each character.[4]
Knemon leaves his house, intending to work in the fields. But just at that moment, Sostratos's mother and a party of followers (including a female piper) arrive carrying food-hampers, incense, and wine. The mother orders the piper to start playing. Getas comes out of the temple and tells her they are ready for the sacrifice. As they enter the temple, the mother asks Knemon what he is staring at. He curses the visitors and decides to go back inside his house.

The backdrop of the stage consists of three buildings: the house of Gorgias (a farmer who is the stepson of Knemon), a temple of Pan and the Nymphs, and the house of Knemon (the Bad-Tempered Man of the title). The action of the play takes place in the street in front of these buildings.
Daos, a slave of Gorgias, comes out of Gorgias's house. Unobserved, he sees Sostratos giving the jar to Knemon's daughter and assumes he is up to no good. He decides he must go at once and inform his master, the girl's half-brother.

Knemon's servant-woman Simiche comes out shouting for help and saying that her master has fallen into the well. The cook Sikon, hearing her, refuses to help. She therefore calls for Gorgias, who comes out of the temple along with Sostratos. They go inside Knemon's house with the old woman. The cook, Sikon, remains on stage saying unsympathetically that it serves the old man right. Saying he hopes Knemon has been crippled by the fall, he returns to the temple.
Now Knemon's daughter comes out carrying a jar. She complains that the old woman has accidentally dropped the water-pot down the well, and she must get some water from the nymphs, if no one is making a sacrifice, so that her father can have a bath. Sostratos steps forward and offers to help her. He takes her jar and goes into the temple.
Dyskolos (Greek: Δύσκολος, pronounced [dýskolos], translated as The Grouch,The Misanthrope, The Curmudgeon, The Bad-tempered Man or Old Cantankerous) is an Ancient Greek comedy by Menander, the only one of his plays, and of the whole New Comedy, that has survived in nearly complete form.[1] It was first presented at the Lenaian festival in Athens in 316 BC, where it won Menander the first prize.

The god Pan comes out from his temple, and explains the background to the play. The scene is the village of Phyle (some 13 miles north-west of Athens). He says that in the house next door lives a bad-tempered and irritable old man, living with his daughter and an old servant-woman. He tells how Knemon married a widow who already had a son by her first husband, but his continual bad temper caused her to leave him and go to live with her son. Pan says that because the girl won his favour by honouring the nymphs in his temple, he caused a certain rich city boy (Sostratos), who was hunting and spotted Knemon's daughter honouring the nymphs, to fall in love with her.

The old servant-woman comes out of Knemon's house, lamenting that when trying to fish out the water jar from the well with a hoe, she had dropped the hoe into the well too. Knemon comes out in a fury and chases her into the house. He says he will go down the well himself. Getas, hearing him, offers to lend him a rope but Knemon curses him and goes inside.
The story of the play concerns a rich young man, Sostratos, who falls in love with a village girl, whose father, Knemon, is very bad-tempered and hard to approach. Eventually, after helping Knemon's stepson Gorgias to rescue him from a well, he wins Knemon over and gains his assent to marry his daughter. He also persuades his own father to allow him to betroth his own sister to Gorgias.
The first modern major performance of Dyskolos was in Sydney, Australia. On 4 July 1959, the University of Sydney Classical Society, at Wallace Theatre, Sydney University, performed Dyskolos.[9]
Sostratos, a young Athenian man who is hunting in the forest, enters with his poor companion Chaireas. He tells Chaireas about his love for the girl, and that he has sent his slave Pyrrhias to talk with her father. Suddenly Pyrrhias comes in running, shouting that he is being chased by a madman who is throwing stones at him. He explains how, when he knocked on the door, the old woman had sent him to the orchard where Knemon was working, and Knemon had been furious and beaten him up. Chaireas says that poor farmers are often bad-tempered. He promises to come back the next day to talk to the girl's father when he has calmed down; then he departs. Sostratos says he suspects that Pyrrhias must have done something wrong, and he sends him home, saying he is going to wait for the girl's father.

Getas comes out of the temple, complaining that the slaves have forgotten the cooking pot. He knocks on Knemon's door hoping to borrow one. Knemon comes out in a fury, refuses to lend him anything, and slams the door. Getas returns to the temple. Sikon comes out, complaining that if you want to borrow anything you have to use flattering words. He knocks on Knemon's door. Knemon comes out even more angrily and starts hitting Sikon with a strap. Sikon stands away and says he merely came to ask to borrow a pot. Seeing that he is getting nowhere, he decides he will roast the meat instead of boiling it. He goes back to the temple.
A group of drunk Pan-worshippers enter and dance to music. They remain in the area in front of the stage until the end of the play, dancing at the end of each act.
Sostratos arrives with Gorgias and Daos. Gorgias seems reluctant at first to accept Sostratos's invitation to the feast, but eventually he tells Daos to go home and attend to his mother, while he himself accompanies Sostratos into the temple.
Sostratos arrives from the field aching all over. He complains that he worked there for a long time, but Knemon never arrived. Suddenly Getas comes out of the temple, complaining that he is having to do all the work himself. Sostratos accosts him. When Getas tells him about the sacrifice, Sostratos decides it would be a good idea to invite Gorgias and Daos to the feast, to get them on his side. He departs to the fields.

Dyskolos is the only one of Menander's texts that has survived nearly completely intact—the papyrus being written in the 3rd century AD.[5] Other plays, such as Samia, Aspis, Heros, Epitrepontes, Perikeiromene have survived in fragments.[6] Fragments of the Dyskolos currently exist in the Vatican Library in Vatican City[7] and the Bibliothèque Bodmer (Bodmer Library) in Cologny, Switzerland.[8]
It was long known only through fragmentary quotations; but a papyrus manuscript of the nearly complete Dyskolos, dating to the 3rd century, was recovered in Egypt in 1952 and forms part of the Bodmer Papyri and Oxyrhynchus Papyri. The play was published in 1958 by Victor Martin.[2]

From the other side of the stage, the cook, Sikon, now arrives, struggling to carry a sheep. He is followed soon afterwards by the slave Getas, who is carrying a huge load of cushions and other things. Getas tells Sikon that his mistress had ordered a sacrifice to be made to Pan because she had had a bad dream that Pan had given her son a hoe and forced him to start digging the neighbour's land. Sikon tells Getas to cheer up and promises him a good meal. They go together into the temple.
Sostratos and his father emerge from the temple. The father has given his assent to Sostratos marrying Knemon's daughter. Now Sostratos tries to persuade him to allow Gorgias to marry Sostratos's sister. Kallipides is at first reluctant, since Gorgias is poor, but eventually gives his assent. Gorgias now steps forward: he has overheard the conversation. He thanks Sostratos but says he can't agree to marrying his sister since he is poor. But after Kallipides encourages him not to be proud, he agrees. Kallipides promises him a dowry of three talents, while Gorgias says he will give his sister one talent. Kallipides says they will hold the two weddings the next day. He tells Gorgias to fetch his mother and sister, and he himself goes into the temple. Sostratos proclaims his delight. Soon Gorgias brings out his sister and mother, and they go into the temple to meet their new in-laws. A little while later Simiche comes out too, after telling Knemon that he is wrong to stay behind when he has been invited.
Knemon now enters from his orchard, grumbling about trespassers. Sostratos addresses him and says that he is waiting for someone. Knemon answers him bad-temperedly and goes inside. Sostratos, who is shy, decides that he must fetch his father's cunning slave Getas to deal with the matter.

Sostratos comes out from Knemon's house. He tells the audience how Gorgias went down the well, while he and the daughter waited above; then he had hauled Knemon out. The door of Knemon's house now opens revealing (by means of an eccyclema or roll-out platform)[3] Knemon lying injured on a couch with Gorgias comforting him. Knemon asks Gorgias to call his mother, Knemon's former wife. (A small part of the manuscript is missing here.) Knemon makes a long speech (the metre changes for this speech from iambic trimeter to trochaic tetrameter catalectic) regretting his misanthropic ways and resolving to be more friendly in future. He tells Gorgias that he is adopting him as his son, and giving him the responsibility for finding a husband for his sister; she may have half his property as a dowry. Gorgias introduces Sostratos, who is standing nearby. Noticing that Sostratos is sunburnt like a farmer, and reassured by Gorgias, Knemon gives his assent to their getting married. He is wheeled back inside his house. Gorgias then betroths his sister to Sostratos.
The Dyskolos inspired Molière, who knew only the theme of the play, as it had not yet been found, in his writing of The Misanthrope (1666).[not verified in body]

A production in French was performed at the Winter Garden Theatre February 7–9, 1957.[4]
When Alceste insults a sonnet written by the powerful noble Oronte, he is called to stand trial. Refusing to dole out false compliments, he is charged and humiliated, and resolves on self-imposed exile.
Robert Cohen's 2006 translation into heroic couplets was praised by the Los Angeles Times as "highly entertaining... with a contemporary flavor full of colloquial yet literate pungency."[10]Professor Cohen's version has been popular in productions staged by his former students, and it is the version staged by Keith Fowler in 2011 for UC Irvine's celebration of Cohen's fifty years at the university.[11]

A L.A. Theatre Works production starring Brian Bedford, recorded in 2012, was released in 2014.
in 1969, Caedmon Records recorded and released on LP a production originally performed that same year at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City using the Richard Wilbur translation and directed by Stephen Porter (see "Stage Productions" above).The cast included Richard Easton as Alceste, Ellis Rabb as Acaste, Keene Curtis as Oronte and Christina Pickles as Celimene.
The play satirizes the hypocrisies of French aristocratic society, but it also engages a more serious tone when pointing out the flaws that afflict all humans. The play differs from other farces of the time by employing dynamic characters like Alceste and Célimène as opposed to the flat caricatures of traditional social satire. It also differs from most of Molière's other works by focusing more on character development and nuances than on plot progression. The play, though not a commercial success in its time, survives as Molière's best known work today.

Despite his sour reputation as the misanthrope, Alceste does have women pining for him, particularly the prudish Arsinoé and the honest Éliante. Though he acknowledges their superior virtues, his heart still lies with Célimène. His deep feelings for her primarily serve to counter his negative expressions about mankind, since the fact that he has such feelings includes him amongst those he so fiercely criticizes.

The Grouch, a more modern verse version of The Misanthrope by Ranjit Bolt was first performed at West Yorkshire Playhouse in February 2008.It is set in contemporary London, and most of the characters' names are recognisably linked to Molière's: in the sequence of the above cast list they are Alan, Celia, Phil, Eileen, Orville, Fay (Arsinoe), Lord Arne, Chris, and manservant Bates. Martin Crimp's adaptation, starring Damian Lewis and Keira Knightley, opened at the Comedy Theatre, London in December 2009. Another adaptation by Roger McGough was premiered by the English Touring Theatre at the Liverpool Playhouse in February 2013 prior to a national tour[12] – this adaptation is largely in verse, but has Alceste speaking in prose.[13]In June 2014, Andy Clark, Rosalind Sydney and Helen MacKay appeared in a three-handed 50-minute Classic Cuts version of The Misanthrope, written in rhyming couplets by Frances Poet, set and performed in the basement theatre of Glasgow's Òran Mór. The Scotsman noted 'the sheer, sharp-edged wit of Poet’s rhyming text, which pays perfect homage to the original, while diving boldly into the new world of fall-outs and friendships conducted on social media.'

The Misanthrope, or the Cantankerous Lover (French: Le Misanthrope ou l'Atrabilaire amoureux; French pronunciation: ​[lə mizɑ̃tʁɔp u latʁabilɛːʁ amuʁø]) is a 17th-century comedy of manners in verse written by Molière. It was first performed on 4 June 1666 at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal, Paris by the King's Players.[1]

Because both Tartuffe and Don Juan, two of Molière's previous plays, had already been banned by the French government, Molière may have softened his ideas to make the play more socially acceptable. As a result, there is much ambiguity about whether the main character Alceste is intended as a hero for his uncompromising honesty, or as a quixotic fool. Molière has been the target of much criticism for The Misanthrope over the years. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau claimed in his Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles that it was Molière's best work, but hated that it made Alceste the butt of its humor. He believed the audience should support Alceste's high ideals rather than laugh at his misadventures.
German-Russian composer Zinaida Petrovna Ziberova composed a musical setting for The Misanthrope in 1934.[9]

Modern adaptations of the play have been written by Tony Harrison and Liz Lochhead.Lochhead's version is set in the early years of the revived Scottish Parliament and satirises Scottish Labour's relationship with the media.Originally written in 1973, Harrison's version was updated and revived at the Bristol Old Vic in 2010. In 1999, Uma Thurman and Roger Rees starred in Classic Stage Company's contemporary version by Martin Crimp directed by Barry Edelstein.[8]
Arsinoé, in trying to win his affections, shows him a love letter Célimène wrote to another suitor. He discovers that Célimène has been leading him on. She has written identical love letters to numerous suitors (including to Oronte) and broken her vow to favor him above all others. He gives her an ultimatum: he will forgive her and marry her if she runs away with him to exile. Célimène refuses, believing herself too young and beautiful to leave society and all her suitors behind. Philinte, for his part, becomes betrothed to Éliante. Alceste then decides to exile himself from society, and the play ends with Philinte and Éliante running off to convince him to return.
Richard Mansfield starred as Alceste in the very first Broadway production April 10–15, 1905 at the New Amsterdam Theatre.[3]

Despite his convictions, however, Alceste cannot help but love the coquette and playful Célimène, a consummate flirt whose wit and frivolity epitomize the courtly manners that Alceste despises. Though he constantly reprimands her, Célimène refuses to change, charging Alceste with being unfit for society because he hates humanity.

Much to the horror of his friends and companions, Alceste rejects la politesse, the social conventions of the seventeenth-century French ruelles (later called salons in the 18th century).[2] His refusal to "make nice" makes him tremendously unpopular and he laments his isolation in a world he sees as superficial and base, saying early in Act I, "... Mankind has grown so base, / I mean to break with the whole human race."

Both made an appearance in Marvel Team-Up #74. In this issue, Spider-Man teams up with the cast of Saturday Night Live to battle the Silver Samurai. Statler and Waldorf appear in typical style as hecklers on a balcony.
In the 1996 series Muppets Tonight, based on a television rather than theatre show, Statler and Waldorf were shown watching the show at an assisted living facility, still making disparaging remarks. The duo are featured characters at Disney's Muppet*Vision 3D at Disney's Hollywood Studios as audio-animatronic Muppets helping Bean Bunny escape the theater and, of course, heckling the show. They also make a cameo appearance in Pixar's 2008 short film Presto, where they can be seen in their theater box.[20]

In "Sex and Violence", the pilot episode of The Muppet Show, Statler and Waldorf were performed by Jerry Nelson and Jim Henson, respectively. Nelson was unavailable for the first few weeks of production on The Muppet Show. As a result, Richard Hunt took on the role of Statler. Hunt and Henson would continue to perform the two characters until Henson's death in 1990. To portray the characters, Hunt and Henson shared very close space, often for hours at a time.[8]
Beginning with The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), Statler and Waldorf were performed by Jerry Nelson and Dave Goelz, respectively.[9] When Jerry Nelson left the Muppets, citing health reasons,[10] Muppeteer Steve Whitmire took over as Statler. The two were occasionally performed by Drew Massey (Statler) and Victor Yerrid (Waldorf) in 2005 and 2006, most notably in the web series Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony.[11] Kevin Clash filled in for Goelz as Waldorf in a few episodes of Muppets Tonight.[12]

They also have a predisposition for breaking the fourth wall. Author Ben Underwood remarked on how the characters generally "blur the boundary between performer and audience", as they are "concurrently audience members and performers".[2] Underwood points to a second season incident in which the characters see themselves watching the Muppets, with Statler skeptical, saying "No one would watch junk like that".[2]
Statler and Waldorf are feature characters in the 2011 movie The Muppets. To promote the film, they also appeared with several other Muppets on the 2011 Halloween episode of WWE Raw,[29] with the duo offering their usual commentary from a skybox.

The characters are known for their heckling.[2] In The Muppet Show, the two are always criticizing Fozzie Bear's humor, except for one occasion where Fozzie heckles them back.[3] In contrast, they find themselves vastly entertaining and inevitably burst into mutual laughter at their own witticisms.[4] It is later revealed in the A Muppet Family Christmas special that the two hecklers are friends with Fozzie's mother, Emily Bear. Despite constantly complaining about the show and how terrible some acts are, they always return for the following week and occupy their usual pair of seats in the balcony. Their reasons for doing so are a mystery even to them, according to one version of the Muppet Show theme (Waldorf: "Why do we always come here?" / Statler: "I guess we'll never know").[5]
The puppets were designed by Bonnie Erickson.[6] They were named after two historic New York City hotels, the Statler Hilton and the Waldorf-Astoria.[7]
On the song "The Black Hole" by HORSE the band, the track ends with Statler and Waldorf celebrating the song and then talking themselves into decrying it as "terrible".
They appear as audience members in The Muppets TV series.[25] The episode "Pig Out" features a B-plot focusing on Statler without Waldorf. They also appear on Muppets Now.

In The Muppet Christmas Carol, they played the ghosts of Jacob and Robert Marley. Whereas the novel A Christmas Carol features only a Jacob Marley, creating a Robert allowed for including the two Muppets, and possibly also references Bob Marley.[17] When Ebenezer Scrooge, played by Michael Caine, accuses them of always criticizing him, they reply "We were always heckling you."[18] In Muppet Treasure Island, they were the figureheads of the Hispaniola. Statler complains about being stuck on the front of the ship, to which Waldorf replies it is better than being in the audience.[19]
Statler and Waldorf appear in featured roles in The Muppets film.[22] They are shown in Kermit's old office where they inform evil oil baron, Tex Richman, that the only thing that could stop his purchase of The Muppet Theater would be Kermit raising $10 million.[23] They appear during one scene of the 2014 sequel Muppets Most Wanted. When the Muppets arrive in Berlin to perform at a run-down cabaret theater, marked by a sign reading "Die Muppets" ("The Muppets" in German), the two joke as to whether this is an early review or a suggestion. This scene is presented in the "Statler and Waldorf Cut" of the film in its home video release.[24]

Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony is a multi-award–winning web show which ran biweekly on Movies.com from June 2005 until September 2006.[26][11] The series spawned more than 35 episodes and featured many Muppet characters, both well-known classics and newly created characters. The two elderly curmudgeons would discuss upcoming films, watch the latest movie trailers and share the week's "balconism" from their theater box.
