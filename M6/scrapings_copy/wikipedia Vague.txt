Many scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance species in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as ring species.Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases.As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is "vague" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding huskies and wolves: are they dogs? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.
Vagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases, judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept.Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc.Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as biological sex can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from transsexuals' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see intersex).

One theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician Lotfi Zadeh. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between "perfect falsity", for example, the statement "Bill Clinton is bald", to "perfect truth", for, say, "Patrick Stewart is bald". In ordinary logics, there are only two truth-values: "true" and "false". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing an infinite number of truth-values along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by "1", and perfect falsity by "0". Borderline cases are thought of as having a "truth-value" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) [2] and Dorothy Edgington (1993).[3]
In the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations.The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be "void for vagueness" and unenforceable.This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid "explicit" or "objectionable" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the vagueness doctrine and in Europe as the principle of legal certainty.

In linguistics and philosophy, a vague predicate is one which gives rise to borderline cases. For example, the English adjective "tall" is vague since it is not clearly true or false for someone of middling height. By contrast, the word "prime" is not vague since every number is definitively either prime or not. Vagueness is commonly diagnosed by a predicate's ability to give rise to the Sorites paradox. Vagueness is separate from ambiguity, in which an expression has multiple denotations. For instance the word "bank" is ambiguous since it can refer either to a river bank or to a financial institution, but there are no borderline cases between both interpretations.

The philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is—which is closely related to the problem of the paradox of the heap, a.k.a. sorites paradox—has been the subject of much philosophical debate.

Subvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or "true on at least some precisifications".[5]

Machina, K.F. 1976. "Truth, belief and vagueness", in Journal of Philosophical Logic Vol. 5. pp. 47-78
The concept of vagueness has philosophical importance. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of "right" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances precising definitions.[1]
Subvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has "truth-value gluts". According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon.[6] Of a borderline case of "bald man" it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.

Given a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate "supertrue" as meaning "true on all precisifications".This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. "Frank is bald", where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the tautologies of sentential logic, such as "Frank is bald or Frank is not bald", will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either "Frank is bald" or "Frank is not bald" will be true.Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can "rescue" them is seen as a virtue.

Keefe, R.; Smith, P., eds. (1997). Vagueness: A Reader. MIT Press.The editors' long introduction gives a clear and very useful overview of theories of vagueness, and they collect many classic papers on the subject.
Another theoretical approach is known as "supervaluationism". This approach has been defended by Kit Fine and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of "truth value gaps". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be "made precise" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.[4]

One possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague.Consider Peter Unger's example of a cloud (from his famous 1980 paper, "The Problem of the Many"): it is not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it is part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one won't know how to answer.So perhaps one's term 'cloud' denotes a vague object precisely.This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to Gareth Evans's short paper "Can There Be Vague Objects?" (1978).[11] Evans's argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. "Princeton = Princeton Borough"), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right.Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.
Still by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving Leibniz's law or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend ontological vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, Peter van Inwagen (1990),[12] Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).[13]
^ Evans, G. (1978). "Can There Be Vague Objects?". Analysis. 38 (4): 208–. doi:10.1093/analys/38.4.208.
A fourth approach, known as "the epistemicist view", has been defended by Timothy Williamson (1994),[7] R. A. Sorensen (1988) [8] and (2001),[9] and Nicholas Rescher (2009).[10] They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is due to one's ignorance. For example, in the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old; some people are ignorant of this fact.
Vagueness is a major topic of research in philosophical logic, where it serves as a potential challenge to classical logic. Work in formal semantics has sought to provide a compositional semantics for vague expressions in natural language. Work in philosophy of language has addressed implications of vagueness for the theory of meaning, while metaphysicians have considered whether reality itself is vague.

When you come across an article that is very vague, begin by replacing vague statements with clearer facts. If you lack the time or the expertise to do so, use one of the tags below and go on reading.
Pronouns allow writers to refer back to a noun without repeating it. However, this can confuse the readers if it is not clear what the pronoun is standing in for.
When used sincerely, vague words make an article confusing and possibly make readers misinterpret or even miss important information altogether. In the hands of those with more sinister intents, vague words can currently be used to make articles that are readable enough to impart wrong or biased information but confusing enough to prevent readers from questioning the reliability or factuality of the article. Vandals can also vandalize an article by replacing specific information with vague statements. Always use citations, especially when – for whatever reason – you must use somewhat vague words. Doing this helps Wikipedia become more reliable and accurate.
Use this for specific words or statements that are vague.

Vague metamorphosed from an earlier proto-club night called the Kit Kat Club at Arcadia operated by Suzy Mason[4] and Paul Fryer[5] (former lead-singer of eighties electropop group Bazooka Joe).[6] Fryer and Mason then in brought in Nick Raphael,[7] and debuted Vague at the High Flyers club in Leeds on 10 April 1993, before moving to The Warehouse a month later. Vague blended kitsch with the artistic and theatrical; its outlandish theme and costume parties included a recreation of a day-night out at Blackpool Pleasure Beach only inside the club that was believed to have been filled entirely with beach sand, parasols and miniature fairground rides, a retake on royal garden parties that was held annually and an evening with Vera Duckworth a fictional character from the British soap opera Coronation Street.

The British music newspaper Melody Maker featured Vague in 1994 in a review called "For Frock's Sake" and described the club as a "Dance Equivalent of Andy Warhol's The Factory",[10] whilst the Daily Telegraph journalist Tim Willis depicted the scene inside of the club as one of "Bacchanalian excess" for the feature "Up North Where Anything Goes".[11] The pioneering ethos that was behind Vague is what made it so successful years before any other club in the UK adopted a similar safe-space approach, according to Richard Smith speaking in 2006 then editor of Britain's leading gay publication Gay Times on the banning by the UK government of gay straight door policies he stated "one of the most important clubs of the 90s was Trannies With Attitude Vague in Leeds. They – quite consciously – started and worked at building up a big mixed, polysexual club night, and succeeded”.[12] The notoriety of Vague during this period helped to put Leeds firmly on the international club scene radar along with the city's other major house music venue, Back to Basics.[13]

The club played a mixture of Handbag house, hard house, hard trance and Classic and electronic Disco music played on the main dance floor, with a more eclectic selection of music played on the upper floor such as Glam punk, Musicals.Rare Soul and Jazz Styles. Resident DJs TWA particularly championed"Techno Disco" or "tesko" (for legal reasons) a brand of disco house at the club. A number of Vague anthems included TWA's Disco Biscuit [14] and Nasty Girls,[15] Atlantic Ocean's Waterfall, Björk's Big Time Sensuality,[16] Lisa Lisa Cult Jam's Let the Beat Hit 'Em, WestBam's Wizards of the Sonic, Fierce Ruling Diva's Get Funky, The Lisa Marie Experience's version of Keep on Jumpin' Keep on Jumpin', Gat Decor's Passion, and Alison Limerick's Where Love Lives. TESKO has been defined as Techno with sex put into it; in other words encapsulating the power of Techno then adding in Funk and the love of Classic Disco.

In April 1996 a boxed double compilation CD - Vague - Now & Then - was released, its accompanying booklet detailing the history of the club.[24] The night ended after Vague[25] celebrated its third birthday at the Warehouse on 14 September 1996. The organizers then went on to pursue other careers in creative industries, Nick Raphael left to become label manager at FFRR Records and is now president of Capitol Records UK, Paul Fryer moved to London and worked for Fendi as Musical director from 2000 to 2005,[26] he has since carved out a highly successful career as an artist with his work collected by Damien Hirst and Karl Lagerfeld,[27] Suzy Mason partnering Kas Shaw continued in Club Promotion with a similar styled mixed night - called "I-Spy" [28] held at Club NATO in Leeds city centre, the pair then transferred back to the Warehouse on 12 April 1997, soon afterwards it was renamed "Speed Queen," [29] which ran for eleven years before closing in 2008. Speed Queen at the Warehouse was one of three clubs featured in a November 1997 BBC local documentary about Leeds nightlife.[30] Mason subsequently went on to a career in academia and is now a Senior Researcher at the Leeds College of Art.[31] and Phil Faversham went on to work at Ministry of Sound as Club Development Director.

The club is credited as being the first in the UK to advertise itself as "mixed"[8]– i.e. for homosexual, heterosexual and polysexual patrons equally, however the claim is not entirely true for example the promoter Leigh Bowery and creator of the Taboo Club night in London in 1985 could be credited with embracing poly-sexual identities in club culture at a much earlier date.[citation needed] Although the vetting of customers on the door at Vague was notoriously strict, [9] for example it was rumoured on some occasions that visiting male heterosexual customers were asked to dress up as a woman, then come back to the club or passionately kiss another male customer in front of door staff, to prove they held no prejudices (a rumour, but never my experience as a heterosexual male - the door staff were always lovingly tolerant of gender and sexuality differences, but Madame JoJo [such a nice person - harsh but fair] - was always delighted to receive a sherbet fountain [not a euphemism] as a sweetener to help accept us non-gay chaps into the club. I hung out with the most flamboyant, spectacular and beautiful queens, yet still met a female, heterosexual partner in the club, which underlines the wonderfully inclusive and eclectic nature of the place). Once inside, the atmosphere was one of tolerance, hedonism, and sexuality.
