The film was partially shot in Mount Rainier National Park in northwest Washington.[4] Schertzinger and his crew of 38 arrived at the park in mid-August and stayed through early September, lodging at the Paradise Inn.[4] The story was based on experiences that writer-producer J.K. McDonald had working in the logging and mining camps in the Pacific Northwest.[5]

As described in a review in a film magazine,[3] when Roland Keene's wife dies, he goes West with a theatrical troupe, leaving his young son Benny (Alexander) in New York. In Placer Valley he meets Sal Flood (Busch), owner of a saloon she inherited from her father. Benny arrives in Placer Valley just in time to witness his father marrying Sal. Roland takes over running the saloon and is being milched by Osner (Lewis), a professional gambler, when Steve McGregor (Santschi), a friend of Sal, intervenes. After a bloody fight, Steve whips the gambler. Sal then takes over the saloon. To meet his gambling debts, Roland is compelled by Osner to open the saloon's safe, which has Steve's gold. When the safe is opened, Benny through a window sees Osner taking the metal. The building is blasted by Osner, and Benny is injured by debris from the building. Benny shields his father when the Sheriff investigates, and Roland sets out to get Osner and return the gold. Osner flees to a tram car, and Roland jumps on it as it begins to travel down from one mountain and then up the next slope. In mid-air he succeeds in spilling Osner to freefall from the tram car to some tree tops far below, but then Roland loses his own grip to luckily land safely on a sandy bank.

The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness
Bible (1534). William Tyndale (trans.); George Joye (revised). Thessalonians. Quoted in: "feeble, adj. and n.". OED Online. November 2010. Oxford University Press. 16 March 2011 .
The British government's Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded (1904–1908), in its Report in 1908 defined the feeble-minded as:
The American psychologist Henry H. Goddard, who coined the term moron, was the director of the Vineland Training School (originally the Vineland Training School for Backward and Feeble-minded Children) at Vineland, New Jersey. Goddard was known for strongly postulating that "feeble-mindedness" was a hereditary trait, most likely caused by a single recessive gene. Goddard rang the eugenic "alarm bells" in his 1912 work, The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness, about those in the population who carried the recessive trait despite outward appearances of normality.
Jack London published a short story, "Told in the Drooling Ward" (1914), which describes inmates at a California institution for the "feeble-minded".He narrates the story from the point of view of a self-styled "high-grade feeb".The California Home for the Care and Training of Feeble-minded Children, later the Sonoma Developmental Center, was located near the Jack London Ranch in Glen Ellen, California.

At the time, mental deficiency encompassed all degrees of educational and social deficiency. Within the concept of mental deficiency, researchers established a hierarchy, ranging from idiocy, at the most severe end of the scale; to imbecility, at the median point; and to feeble-mindedness at the highest end of functioning. The last was conceived of as a form of high-grade mental deficiency.[1]

In the first half of the 20th century, a diagnosis of "feeble-mindedness, in any of its grades" was a common criterion for many states in the United States, which embraced eugenics as a progressive measure, to mandate the compulsory sterilization of such patients. In the 1927 US Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes closed the 8–1 majority opinion upholding the sterilization of Carrie Buck, with the phrase, "Three generations of imbeciles are enough."[6] Buck, her mother and daughter were all classified as feeble-minded.
[P]ersons who may be capable of earning a living under favourable circumstances, but are incapable from mental defect, existing from birth or from an early age: (1) of competing on equal terms with their normal fellows, or (2) of managing themselves and their affairs with ordinary prudence.[3]

Despite being pejorative, in its day the term was considered, along with idiot, imbecile, and moron, to be a relatively precise psychiatric classification.

The development of the ranking system of mental deficiency has been attributed to Sir Charles Trevelyan in 1876, and was associated with the rise of eugenics.[2] The term and hierarchy had been used in that sense at least 10 years previously.[3]"Wild card" terms outside the established hierarchy such as idiot savant, may have been used as connotations for varying degrees of autism.[citation needed]

The term feeble-minded was used from the late 19th century in Europe, the United States and Australasia for disorders later referred to as illnesses or deficiencies of the mind.
The earliest recorded use of the term in the English language dates from 1534, when it appears in one of the first English translations of the New Testament, the Tyndale Bible.A biblical commandment to "Comforte the feble mynded" is included in 1 Thessalonians.[4]
