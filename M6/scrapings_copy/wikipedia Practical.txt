In the set of all practical numbers there is a primitive set of practical numbers. A primitive practical number is either practical and squarefree or practical and when divided by any of its prime factors whose factorization exponent is greater than 1 is no longer practical. The sequence of primitive practical numbers (sequence A267124 in the OEIS) begins

If n{\displaystyle n} is practical, then any rational number of the form m/n{\displaystyle m/n} with m<n{\displaystyle m<n} may be represented as a sum ∑di/n{\textstyle \sum d_{i}/n} where each di{\displaystyle d_{i}} is a distinct divisor of n{\displaystyle n}. Each term in this sum simplifies to a unit fraction, so such a sum provides a representation of m/n{\displaystyle m/n} as an Egyptian fraction. For instance,

Since r≤σ(n/pk){\displaystyle r\leq \sigma (n/p_{k})}, and since n/pk{\displaystyle n/p_{k}} can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of r as a sum of divisors of n/pk{\displaystyle n/p_{k}}.
Several other notable sets of integers consist only of practical numbers:

Since q≤σ(n/pkαk){\displaystyle q\leq \sigma (n/p_{k}^{\alpha _{k}})} and n/pkαk{\displaystyle n/p_{k}^{\alpha _{k}}} can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of q as a sum of divisors of n/pkαk{\displaystyle n/p_{k}^{\alpha _{k}}}.
Practical numbers have also been shown to be analogous with prime numbers in many of their properties.[3]
By induction on j∈[1,αk]{\displaystyle j\in [1,\alpha _{k}]}, it can be shown that pkj≤1+σ(n/pkαk−(j−1)){\displaystyle p_{k}^{j}\leq 1+\sigma (n/p_{k}^{\alpha _{k}-(j-1)})}. Hence pkαk≤1+σ(n/pk){\displaystyle p_{k}^{\alpha _{k}}\leq 1+\sigma (n/p_{k})}.
Since the internals [qpkαk,qpkαk+σ(n/pk)]{\displaystyle [qp_{k}^{\alpha _{k}},qp_{k}^{\alpha _{k}}+\sigma (n/p_{k})]} cover [1,σ(n)]{\displaystyle [1,\sigma (n)]} for 1≤q≤σ(n/pkαk){\displaystyle 1\leq q\leq \sigma (n/p_{k}^{\alpha _{k}})}, there are such a q{\displaystyle q} and some r∈[0,σ(n/pk)]{\displaystyle r\in [0,\sigma (n/p_{k})]} such that m=qpkαk+r{\displaystyle m=qp_{k}^{\alpha _{k}}+r}.

Let p(x){\displaystyle p(x)} count how many practical numbers are at most x{\displaystyle x}.Margenstern (1991) conjectured that p(x){\displaystyle p(x)} is asymptotic to cx/log⁡x{\displaystyle cx/\log x} for some constant c{\displaystyle c}, a formula which resembles the prime number theorem, strengthening the earlier claim of Erdős & Loxton (1979) that the practical numbers have density zero in the integers.Improving on an estimate of Tenenbaum (1986), Saias (1997) found that p(x){\displaystyle p(x)} has order of magnitude x/log⁡x{\displaystyle x/\log x}.Weingartner (2015) proved Margenstern's conjecture. We have[12]
The condition stated above is necessary and sufficient for a number to be practical. In one direction, this condition is necessary in order to be able to represent pi−1{\displaystyle p_{i}-1} as a sum of divisors of n{\displaystyle n}, because if the inequality failed to be true then even adding together all the smaller divisors would give a sum too small to reach pi−1{\displaystyle p_{i}-1}. In the other direction, the condition is sufficient, as can be shown by induction. More strongly, if the factorization of n{\displaystyle n} satisfies the condition above, then any m≤σ(n){\displaystyle m\leq \sigma (n)} can be represented as a sum of divisors of n{\displaystyle n}, by the following sequence of steps:[4]

The product of two practical numbers is also a practical number.[5] More strongly the least common multiple of any two practical numbers is also a practical number. Equivalently, the set of all practical numbers is closed under multiplication.

From the above characterization by Stewart and Sierpiński it can be seen that if n{\displaystyle n} is a practical number and d{\displaystyle d} is one of its divisors then n⋅d{\displaystyle n\cdot d} must also be a practical number.

One reason for interest in practical numbers is that many of their properties are similar to properties of the prime numbers. Indeed, theorems analogous to Goldbach's conjecture and the twin prime conjecture are known for practical numbers: every positive even integer is the sum of two practical numbers, and there exist infinitely many triples of practical numbers (x−2,x,x+2){\displaystyle (x-2,x,x+2)}.[9] Melfi also showed[10] that there are infinitely many practical Fibonacci numbers (sequence A124105 in the OEIS); the analogous question of the existence of infinitely many Fibonacci primes is open. Hausman & Shapiro (1984) showed that there always exists a practical number in the interval [x2,(x+1)2)]{\displaystyle [x^{2},(x+1)^{2})]} for any positive real x{\displaystyle x}, a result analogous to Legendre's conjecture for primes. Moreover, for all sufficiently large x{\displaystyle x}, the interval [x−x0.4872,x]{\displaystyle [x-x^{0.4872},x]} contains many practical numbers.[11]

where σ(x){\displaystyle \sigma (x)} denotes the sum of the divisors of x. For example, 2 × 32 × 29 × 823 = 429606 is practical, because the inequality above holds for each of its prime factors: 3 ≤ σ(2) + 1 = 4, 29 ≤ σ(2 × 32) + 1 = 40, and 823 ≤ σ(2 × 32 × 29) + 1 = 1171.

Every even perfect number is also a practical number.[7] This follows from Leonhard Euler's result that an even perfect number must have the form 2k−1(2k−1){\displaystyle 2^{k-1}(2^{k}-1)}. The odd part of this factorization equals the sum of the divisors of the even part, so every odd prime factor of such a number must be at most the sum of the divisors of the even part of the number. Therefore, this number must satisfy the characterization of practical numbers.
Margenstern (1991) cites Robinson (1979) and Heyworth (1980) for the name "panarithmic numbers".
The name "practical number" is due toSrinivasan (1948). He noted that "the subdivisions of money, weights, and measures involve numbers like 4, 12, 16, 20 and 28 which are usually supposed to be so inconvenient as to deserve replacement by powers of 10." His partial classification of these numbers was completed by Stewart (1954) and Sierpiński (1955). This characterization makes it possible to determine whether a number is practical by examining its prime factorization. Every even perfect number and every power of two is also a practical number.

Every primorial (the product of the first i{\displaystyle i} primes, for some i{\displaystyle i}) is practical.[7] For the first two primorials, two and six, this is clear. Each successive primorial is formed by multiplying a prime number pi{\displaystyle p_{i}} by a smaller primorial that is divisible by both two and the next smaller prime, pi−1{\displaystyle p_{i-1}}. By Bertrand's postulate, pi<2pi−1{\displaystyle p_{i}<2p_{i-1}}, so each successive prime factor in the primorial is less than one of the divisors of the previous primorial. By induction, it follows that every primorial satisfies the characterization of practical numbers. Because a primorial is, by definition, squarefree it is also a primitive practical number.

This partial characterization was extended and completed by Stewart (1954) and Sierpiński (1955) who showed that it is straightforward to determine whether a number is practical from its prime factorization.A positive integer greater than one with prime factorization n=p1α1...pkαk{\displaystyle n=p_{1}^{\alpha _{1}}...p_{k}^{\alpha _{k}}} (with the primes in sorted order p1<p2<⋯<pk{\displaystyle p_{1}<p_{2}<\dots <p_{k}}) is practical if and only if each of its prime factors pi{\displaystyle p_{i}} is small enough for pi−1{\displaystyle p_{i}-1} to have a representation as a sum of smaller divisors. For this to be true, the first prime p1{\displaystyle p_{1}} must equal 2 and, for every i from 2 to k, each successive prime pi{\displaystyle p_{i}} must obey the inequality

From the above properties with n{\displaystyle n} a practical number and d{\displaystyle d} one of its divisors (that is, d|n{\displaystyle d|n}) then n⋅d{\displaystyle n\cdot d} must also be a practical number therefore six times every power of 3 must be a practical number as well as six times every power of 2.
Practical numbers were used by Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci (1202) in connection with the problem of representing rational numbers as Egyptian fractions. Fibonacci does not formally define practical numbers, but he gives a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for fractions with practical denominators.[2]
Fibonacci, in his 1202 book Liber Abaci[2] lists several methods for finding Egyptian fraction representations of a rational number. Of these, the first is to test whether the number is itself already a unit fraction, but the second is to search for a representation of the numerator as a sum of divisors of the denominator, as described above. This method is only guaranteed to succeed for denominators that are practical. Fibonacci provides tables of these representations for fractions having as denominators the practical numbers 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 60, and 100.
Every power of two is a practical number.[7] Powers of two trivially satisfy the characterization of practical numbers in terms of their prime factorizations: the only prime in their factorizations, p1, equals two as required.

In number theory, a practical number or panarithmic number[1] is a positive integer n{\displaystyle n} such that all smaller positive integers can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of n{\displaystyle n}. For example, 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: as well as these divisors themselves, we have 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 6 + 1, 8 = 6 + 2, 9 = 6 + 3, 10 = 6 + 3 + 1, and 11 = 6 + 3 + 2.
The original characterisation by Srinivasan (1948) stated that a practical number cannot be a deficient number, that is one of which the sum of all divisors (including 1 and itself) is less than twice the number unless the deficiency is one. If the ordered set of all divisors of the practical number n{\displaystyle n} is d1,d2,...,dj{\displaystyle {d_{1},d_{2},...,d_{j}}} with d1=1{\displaystyle d_{1}=1} and dj=n{\displaystyle d_{j}=n}, then Srinivasan's statement can be expressed by the inequality
Vose (1985) showed that every rational number x/y{\displaystyle x/y} has an Egyptian fraction representation with O(log⁡y){\displaystyle O({\sqrt {\log y}})} terms. The proof involves finding a sequence of practical numbers ni{\displaystyle n_{i}} with the property that every number less than ni{\displaystyle n_{i}} may be written as a sum of O(log⁡ni−1){\displaystyle O({\sqrt {\log n_{i-1}}})} distinct divisors of ni{\displaystyle n_{i}}. Then, i{\displaystyle i} is chosen so that ni−1<y<ni{\displaystyle n_{i-1}<y<n_{i}}, and xni{\displaystyle xn_{i}} is divided by y{\displaystyle y} giving quotient q{\displaystyle q} and remainder r{\displaystyle r}. It follows from these choices that xy=qni+ryni{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{y}}={\frac {q}{n_{i}}}+{\frac {r}{yn_{i}}}}. Expanding both numerators on the right hand side of this formula into sums of divisors of ni{\displaystyle n_{i}} results in the desired Egyptian fraction representation. Tenenbaum & Yokota (1990) use a similar technique involving a different sequence of practical numbers to show that every rational number x/y{\displaystyle x/y} has an Egyptian fraction representation in which the largest denominator is O(ylog2⁡y/log⁡log⁡y){\displaystyle O(y\log ^{2}y/\log \log y)}.
The only odd practical number is 1, because if n{\displaystyle n} is an odd number greater than 2, then 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct divisors of n{\displaystyle n}. More strongly, Srinivasan (1948) observes that other than 1 and 2, every practical number is divisible by 4 or 6 (or both).

Mechanical effects, such as aerial rigging to simulate flight, stage mounted gimbals to make the ground move, or other mechanical devices to physically manipulate the environment.
Many of the staples of action movies are practical effects. Gunfire, bullet wounds, rain, wind, fire, and explosions can all be produced on a movie set by someone skilled in practical effects. Non-human characters and creatures produced with make-up, prosthetics, masks, and puppets – in contrast to computer-generated images – are also examples of practical effects.

A practical effect is a special effect produced physically, without computer-generated imagery or other post-production techniques. In some contexts, "special effect" is used as a synonym of "practical effect", in contrast to "visual effects" which are created in post-production through photographic manipulation or computer generation.

Schumacher and a few of his associates, including George McRobie, Julia Porter,[3] Alfred Latham-Koenig and Professor Mansur Hoda, decided to create an "advisory centre" to promote the use of efficient labour-intensive techniques, and in 1966 the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) was born.[4][5]

Practical Action (previously known as the Intermediate Technology Development Group, ITDG) is a development charity registered in the United Kingdom[1] which works directly in four regions of the developing world – Latin America, East Africa, Southern Africa and South Asia, with particular concentration on Peru, Bolivia, Kenya, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Nepal.
In July 2005, ITDG changed its working name to Practical Action, and since 2008 this has been its legal name.
From its origins as a technical enquiry service, ITDG began to take a greater direct involvement in local projects. Following initial successes in farming, it developed working groups on energy, building materials and rural health, and soon grew to become an international organisation. The group now has seven regional offices, working on over 100 projects around the world, with a head office in the UK.
In 1965, economist and philosopher E. F. Schumacher had an article published in The Observer,[2] pointing out the limitations of aid based on the transfer of large-scale technologies to developing countries which did not have the resources to accommodate them. He argued that there should be a shift in emphasis towards intermediate technologies based on the needs and skills possessed by the people of developing countries.
