To promote the album, the band co-headlined the This World Is Ours tour with metalcore band Attack Attack!. Other acts on the tour included The Word Alive, Secrets, and Mest.[7] The first leg of the tour was in North America, and started on April 5, 2012, in Buffalo, New York, and ended in Vancouver, Canada on May 16. On the tour, the band played a new song from the fourth album titled "Live Fast, Die Beautiful" with Attack Attack! lead singer Caleb Shomo possibly hinting towards him being featured on the song, which ultimately didn't end up happening, although Shomo helped write the song. There was originally going to be a second leg of the tour in Central and South America, starting on June 23 in Curitiba, Brazil, and ending on July 1 in Mexico City, Mexico,[8] but Attack Attack! announced that they were cancelling it. Escape the Fate then announced that instead, they will be joining Underoath and Protest the Hero on a different South American tour, starting on May 26 in Curitiba, Brazil, and ending on May 30 in Santiago, Chile.[9][10]
On Twitter, Mabbitt and TJ Bell revealed that Patrick Stump was working with the band to write a new track. This was later confirmed and the title of the song is "Painting", and ultimately the album was titled "Picture Perfect".[5] In an interview, the band spoke about the song they wrote with Mick Mars of Mötley Crüe. Mabbitt said that although they liked the track, they did not feel it was right for them, thus voting against using it.

Since the release of their third album, Escape the Fate, the band had begun writing material for their tentative fourth album. Recording began in February 2012, following the recording for Craig Mabbitt's solo project Dead Rabbitts, and ended in March. The band hinted towards the new album on a Facebook post on New Year's Eve saying, "Happy new year everyone. We love you all. Next year will see a new album for all of you!!!".[2] The band's lead guitarist, Monte, originally left their tour in 2011 because he did not feel comfortable around Max Green. During his absence from the tour, he recorded over a hundred guitar demos for the album. In March 2012, the band announced that bassist Max Green had left the band due to personal differences.[3] Despite the departure, Green remained friends with the band to the point where he even attended a concert by them. To replace Green, the band made former Motionless in White member, TJ Bell, who had already been touring with the band since early 2011 in place of Max, an official member. Along with this, the band also announced that touring member, Michael Money, had become an official member, providing rhythm guitar for the band.[4]
