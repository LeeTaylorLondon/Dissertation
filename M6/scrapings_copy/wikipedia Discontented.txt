Much of the publication's content is explained from a clean slate - in comics, many strips contain a telling of the character's origin story.
The sometimes "rough" or "unfinished" feel of a first issue, that results from the "bedding in" of the publication process and half-formed ideas, is appreciated by readers more than are subsequent issues.
First issues of publications often have an increased market value, due to their perceived increased originality.
